0,Love this Sub shop and the location on Central and Camrlback.. 10/10 on customer service; 10/10 on food quality; 10/10 on facility cleanliness! This the place to be if you want awesome service and great food.,1.0,1.0
0,This was a very good burger. I ordered the 1/3lb Arizona special with a fried egg. They cook their Angus beef burger at a high heat with a crispy finish; and it tasted great!  Also ordered a side of their herb yam fries which were very good.  They also have Tazo iced tea; which was a nice touch. This location is a bit of a pain; since there is no free parking (it is in a parkade; so you can get some shade by parking in there). The burgers are $5.99 with an extra $1.99 for fries or yam fries.,0.0,0.0
0," Last night I was invited to Smashburger as a VIP (YAY) and was able to partake in some of their menu items for free. Now me pass up a free meal; hmm NEVER!   So I mosey on to Tempe after sitting in traffic for about an hour (boooo) but was able to snag a great parking space and made my way into Smashburger. My first impression was that it was cute little place and yes it is a bit small but cute for a burger place. I met up with Christina; who by the way was fabulous. (Thank you Christina for inviting me) and she gave me a menu; told me about the place and let me know that anything I wanted was on the house. Gotta love that right? The first thing I asked her was \ where is the ladies room?'\   In which she informed me that it was actually outside; around the corner as that is how the restaurants are set up on College Ave. If you could have seen the look on my face. WOW! So after getting what has to be the biggest bathroom key ring I have EVER seen; I made my way around the corner to the ladies room. Although it was well lit; it still creeped me out that I had to go around the corner and kinda towards the back. Although it was very clean; still not really comfortable with that but again I guess that is how it is on College Ave. 1 star   Any-who; I proceeded to order the following food to try out and here they are:   Chocolate Milkshake - OMG! I don't even like Haagen -Daz ice cream (that is what the shakes are made with) and let me tell you that this was the BEST chocolate milkshake I have had in a very long time. Think; rich; and oh so good. 5 stars   Smashfries- they are made with rosemary; olive oil; garlic and other herbs. I was a little bummed as depending on which fry I picked up it was either cold; warm; or hot. Not consistent! 1star   Onion stack - Now I love me some onion rings but I didn't get to try them because when I got them guess what; they were COLD!!! I was so disappointed. How do you get cold onion rings? Double boo!! 0 stars   Arizona Smashburger- I had the 1/2 lb one and it had habanero cheese; guacamole; onions; chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun. (I did not have the lettuce and tomato but it comes with that too) OMG! That was one good burger. Nice and spicy; the bun was way to small for that burger but it was so good. A chipotle bun? Who knew! The seasonings that they put on this burger made it really pop. I was thoroughly happy with it. 5 stars!   I did meet Greg and Kirk; (Regional Vice President and Franchise Owner in that order I believe) and I did express my thoughts on my meal; especially my fries and onion rings. They did offer to bring me out more and apologized profusely; but I declined as I did not want to waste any more food even if it was free as I there was no way I was going to be able to anything else after that burger and milkshake. 5 stars   Oh and the best part of the night; I got to meet fellow yelper Alexander C. and his friend Erin and I was able to go in the back and smash my own burger! That was very cool! 5 stars   So all in all; a few quirks regarding hot fries and onions rings; but the burgers were really good. Its a little pricey as well so be warned. They are opening up a couple more in the next few months. One on 99th Ave and McDowell; and one on 20th St and Camelback so be on the lookout. These locations will have wine and beer added as well.

0,So; how much do you like hamburgers?  Do you like them enough to pay $8 for one?  Do you like them enough to willingly go near ASU?  If you're still nodding your head; chances are good that you'll like Smashburger.    As burger joints go; it's one of the nicer ones--clean; stylish decor; and friendly employees are big pluses here.  You will pay for those pluses though; when you find yourself forking over more than $10 for the prototypical burger; fries; and high fructose corn syrup drink of your choice.    What you'll get for that ten-spot is somewhat distinctive though.  Smashburger's claim to fame; of course; is the way that they seer the burger patty; thus getting it piping hot in a hurry.  What this means for you is that you'll be the proud owner of one of the messier burgers in America.  Grab plenty of napkins and plan to wear a shirt you don't mind getting greasy.    I suppose the fries are a love em'/hate 'em affair.  If you're a traditionalist; prepare to be annoyed:  Smashfries are doused in oil and herbs.  They make a nice taste; but get old pretty quickly and I've never been able to finish an order.  Though hardly cheap or perfect; I like Smashburger on occasion as it's a nice change from the usual fast food fare.,1.0,1.0
0," It's no secret that I love me a good cheeseburger  so I was excited to try a new place. New to me anyway :)  My first impression of the place is they could use a hand. It was kinda busy (Friday lunchtime) but there were only two people in front of me in line and it still took forever. Partly because when I finally got up to front the one guy taking orders had to stop to make shakes. Another guy finally came out after a few minutes and took my order. So they're not the fastest place in town.  But; I was happy to see their menu featured a uild your own\   option. I like my burger relatively plain so I ordered the regular bun; american cheese; tomato; lettuce and mayo. I also ordered a side of the smashfries. Who could turn down fries with olive oil and rosemary? Not this girl.  The burger was juicy and tasted fresh but was a bit on the salty side. The boyfriend and friend both said theirs were not too salty so it was just mine I guess. It happens.  The fries were tasty; thin cut and came out nice and hot. Reminded me a little of McDonald's fries but with oil and rosemary. The boyfriend had the onion strings which were also a little on the salty side. Maybe the cook that day just really likes salt?  If it weren't for the over-saltiness of my burger I would have thought it was quite tasty so I'm willing to try Smashburger again. And the manager walked by several times asking how our food was. I probably should have said something but it wasn't bad enough that I didn't eat it so I can't be too hard on them.   ",1.0,1.0
0,Damn you cheeseburgers and how good you taste; I would be a healthier person if this deliciousness were never invented.  At least at Smashburger I have the option to negate the damage that I may be doing to my health when I eat their awesome; juicy; tasty cheeseburger by ordering their mixed-vegetable side instead of their fries.    Don't get me wrong; the fries are good.  I haven't tried the Smash Fries yet; but given the great flavor of everything else that I've eaten at Smashburger; I would imagine that those seasoned fries are damned good too.  Nevertheless; opting for the asparagus/ string beans/ carrots mixture is a good way to fool yourself into believing that you are eating a light and healthy lunch.  I was also fooled when I saw my Smashburger.  Perhaps the tray that it came on was an optical illusion; but when my 1/3 lb. burger was brought to my table I thought that maybe I didn't order enough food for lunch.  Yet when I was half way through my meal I definitely realized that I had more than enough food to eat.    Just like many other new fast food restaurant concepts that are popping up all over the place; the food at Smashburger tastes as though it is fresh and of very high quality.  In the same vein; the food definitely tasted as though it was made explicitly for my order and had never seen a warming tray or a microwave.  I only wish that there were more Smashburgers in the Valley because when ASU goes back into session I would imagine that it will be very difficult to grab a quick lunch at this restaurant.,1.0,0.0
0,I never get chips; or fries. Usually just a drink. This place makes me get the amazing sweet potato fries with olive oil and rosemary..their burgers come second to lobby's; though; and the service at this location is shitty at best.

0,As I walk down University Avenue along the ASU campus I see the usual suspects; coffee houses; bookstores; and oodles of fast food joints.  Today there is a new kid in town.  Smashburger.  A fresh take on the classic fast food burger joint; Smashburger offers made-to-order burgers; Rosemary; olive oil; garlic fries (Smashfries); and Haagen-Dazs shakes.  Every Smashburger is made when it's ordered; so don't come here if you are late to class; the wait from order to delivery is about five to seven minutes; and you'll want to take your time enjoying these burgers.  Smashburger takes a different approach to burger preparation - they start with a one-third or half pound ball of 100% fresh Angus beef; smash; sear; and season it on a flat grill; then serve it on a buttered-toasted artisan bun and top it with cheese; fresh produce and condiments. The result is an irregularly shaped; juicy; delicious burger.  I stopped down there today for the grand opening and tried the BBQ; Bacon; &amp; Cheese Smashburger ($5.99) with Smashfries ($1.79); and Veggie Frites ($2.99).  Right away I noticed that the Smashburger differentiates itself from other burgers with ambrosial seasonings and juiciness.  Yes; this burger was juicier than Perez Hilton gossip at a Hollywood red carpet event.  These guys really have the searing down to a science.  A few other points of interest - the Smashfries are delicious; the whole rosemary; garlic; oil coating really works well.  Points for the Veggie Frites; too.  You get a nice blend of asparagus; carrots; and green beans; which are flash fried and seasoned; then served hot to your table. They offer a few other menu items including a Smashchicken sandwiches; Smashdogs; and Smashsalads (if you're into that healthy stuff).  If Smashburger has a weakness; it's the hours of operation.  I mean; come on.. you are operating on a college campus and closing at 10 PM every night?  Seriously?  One thing ASU needs are more places to soak up all that alcohol after a long night on the sauce.  I'll give Smashburger a half point back for opening at 10 AM to help cure the hangover the next day.  I have a feeling that a smashed; seared burger and greasy coated fries may remedy the brown bottle flu.  Overall; Smashburger is a hit and is sure to win the hearts and minds of hungry college students roaming the streets of Tempe; Arizona.,0.0,1.0
0,I always wanted to try this place because its always busy so I assumed it was really good. We stopped by after a long hot day walking around ASU so we were really hot tired and hungry. I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and my kids had the Avocado club crispy chicken. Very disappointed because it seemed like portions of the burger was really salty and other bites had no salt so I didn't think it was very good. The chicken sandwich was also pretty salty. The fries are cut very thin and I don't think they were very good. Nothing to write home about. Overall I wasn't impressed at all by the food.  The service on the other hand was great. He was very friendly; patient and helpful which I appreciate. He even gave us free drinks because he saw how hot; tired and flush we were so I thought that was nice. They were very good in cleaning the tables so that new customers could sit down. I could get a better burger at another place next time.,1.0,1.0

0," Boo for Chick-fil-A closing the Ghettrocenter location; which was closer; but yea for this location for being so much closer than Arrowhead.  Come to think of it; this location was quicker and more efficient than Arrowhead; resulting in hotter; fresher food.  Yea for Deer Valley Chick-fil-A. My lunch hour drive thru order was ready before I was with the cash; meaning the chicken's precooked; but they still had to slap it together; since I got the lettuce and tomato.  All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce; good-as-can-be-expected tomato (2 slices); and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum.  The two clerks I interacted with were friendly and it even seemed genuine.  Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices; but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have. (Exactly what part of the chicken is the 'patty'; anyway?)  Churchies own all their places; so they are oh so annoyingly closed on Sundays as a rule.  But the food is so good that any effort to protest them by not going the rest of the week would be short-lived.  Now if they ever started in-store proselytizing; that'd be a different story; but they've never done that; far as I can tell.  When I go in; I get the Ice Dream; exactly what part of the cow that is; I do not know; but it's sad to think they get those cows' hopes up by making them stooges for their \EAT MORE CHIKN\   mock-protest marketing campaign; only to steal their dreams from them one way or another; and freeze them up for a tasty frozen dessert.  I picture a dark and gloomy torture room; probably the basement of one of their churches; where cows are strapped up and sucked of their dreams;  like the hapless folk from the Dark Crystal having their 'essence' drained by the Skeksies.  Or maybe that's how they get the fresh lemonade?   ",1.0,0.0

0,First time actually eating at a Chick-fil-A; and I am a fan! The customer service far excited 90% of the service you get at other fast food places.   There was a play area for the kids; which made everyone happy! The gilled chicken sandwich was tender and overall delicious. I am a little embarrassed that it took me so long to try this place. The only negative thing was that the kids chicken nuggets were kind of small; but that is probably because they are actually chicken unlike other places.  I look forward to eating here again.,1.0,1.0
0,My first time ever eating at a Chick Fil A. Yum yum and yum.  Tried the chicken nuggets; the tortilla soup; the waffle fries and a chocolate shake. I was extremely full. No; I did not eat it all. I did sample each of it and the shake was THE BEST PART! The nuggets aren't your mcdonalds nuggets. These are real nuggets of meat; not a byproduct and its all in the sauce. The chick fil a sauce was my favorite. Fast friendly service and a very clean restaurant.,1.0,0.0
0," Chick-fil-A is always good; but this location is awesome. I'd like to do a study on their training program and corporate culture and this is the location where I'd start. \Oh; my pleasure!\   See how many times you can hear that when making an order through the drive-thru.   Oh yeah; and the food is good too! I don't know what they do to the chicken breasts they make their sandwiches with; but man they are good! I'm addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich. Let's face it; nothing fried is \  healthy\   but using fresh ingredients; peanut oil (cholesterol free and no trans fats) is a good start; and they do have truly healthy offerings if you want to go that route (sorry; no waffle cut fries on that menu!)

Then he said; \Actually; here is some seasoning\   He gave us one container of cajun seasoning. We said we would prefer them remade; it tastes great fresh and with the seasoning. At that point; he was ignoring us so we just went back to our table and began eating.   I'm not impressed with their lack of customer service. We ordered something; we should get it.

0,The way my Dad talked about this place I seriously expected them to give you free lapdances with each meal. He serviced them and said their kitchen was one of the cleanest fast food kitchens he'd ever seen and then went on to blab for hours about how their food couldn't compare to anything else and they were going to change the way Arizona sees fast food.  We came here as a family for dinner. The place was REALLY crowded and the line long. It's kind of hard to order because they make everything made to order (which is good I mean...yum fresh!) but that means you have to explain what you want in detail on every burger. When you're ordering for a family of five; that makes it kind of complicated. I thought their prices were a little high too but my dad insisted it was worth it.   The burgers were really good. I was a big fan. The fries were whatever; but my dad ordered fried cheese curds and those were really tasty. Everything came out pretty quick but we discovered that we had been charged for an extra meal. So we ended up taking home a meal we didn't order because the line was so long we didn't want to complain about it. My family ordered frozen custard but I'm lactose intolerant so I held out. They said it was great though.  I'd definitely come back here but not with my entire family. The ordering situation was just too intense and messy for me. If they're going to be as busy as they are; they should really have a better system.,0.0,0.0
0,I expected much more from this place.  I had heard exciting tales of succulent burgers cooked in yummy butter; and while I could definitely taste the butter; the rest was bland and poorly balanced.  Fries were ok; but they felt like a cheap Del Taco knock-off.  Service?  If you like a snotty heavy-set woman getting short with you; then it's great.  Culver's needs to hire some better folks; especially if they're trying to get their foot in the door here in Arizona.  They need employees who can think.  I had a coupon for a buy one get one free Double Deluxe; and they wouldn't substitute a cheaper burger for the free one.  Logic doesn't fly here; apparently.  Oh; and whoever designed the parking lot is an idiot.  What a horrible; cramped design.  If you drive a big truck or SUV; good luck to you.  I won't go back.,0.0,0.0

0,Hadn't been to Culver's in a couple of years; since I changed jobs and don't get out this way anymore. Nice to see they haven't changed. Frequented by seniors because it's a Midwest fave and for the good prices.   Ordered the bacon cheddar butter burger (single) with curds and a drink for under $8. Lunch arrived in 6 minutes flat-nice. Burger was hot; juicy and choice of standard toppings: mayo; mustard; onions; lettuce; tomato; etc.   Bacon was crisp too; just perfect. Cheese was thick cut with a slight melt. The cheese curds are not what you'd expect on your first visit. They bread them and fry them to perfection. Nice little cheesy nuggets of flavor.   The service at Culver's is always tops. Greeted properly at the door but not with the robotic 'welcome' you get at fast food. As the food is delivered to your table; the server always asks if there is anything else they can get for you. I was offered a custard sample at my table as well.

I guess it's like the whole Coke vs. Pepsi thing; except with burgers. And my choice is obvious. Tons of choices for toppings and condiments; fries are crinkle-style and tasty; and the selection of deserts is almost too much! Fresh food; friendly service; clean dining room and restrooms.

0," Visited Potbelly on a Saturday around 12:30PM. Skip to the last paragraph for the short and sweet review.  I've seen this place a few times and finally had a good opportunity to stop in and grab a to-go order.  I like the name and figured it would be average (worst case); but hopefully I would be surprised. This location shares a building space with Starbucks.   Although parking is a bit limited I found a space straight away. I found the decor warm and inviting.  It smelled of toasted bread; a plus in my opinion. After a short wait for two people ahead of me a very pleasant and friendly person; Ann I believe; took my order. I ordered a tuna salad sub on multigrain bread as well as one of their signature sandwiches called \A Wreck\   on their white bread.   I also substituted cheddar cheese on the wreck and no cheese on the tuna salad.  They toast their sandwiches; so into the toaster they went.  When they come out the other side you can ask to add your choice of condiments. I asked for lettuce; tomato and onion on both; with some Italian seasoning on the Wreck.  I added some Zipps kettle chips (delicious chips made in Louisiana) and a sugar cookie. My bill came to a total of $13 and change.  Most of the sandwich options are around $5. I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Arriving home I tried half of each sandwich along with the BBQ Zipps chips and found everything to be pretty good.  The bread toasted up nicely; leaving a crusty exterior.  Based on the price; I felt the sub had adequate amounts of ingredients.  There were options on the menu for extra meat and the like.  The sandwiches themselves were around 7 inches.  Although it was not mind blowing or life altering...I mean; it's a sandwich shop for Pete's sake!  The place was nice; clean and had a pleasant and friendly staff.  Service was quick and efficient.  The food was good.  Would I go back again? Yes.   ",1.0,1.0
0," Potbelly sandwiches; what a hype machine! After months of hearing about their \amazing\   subs that supposedly make customers \  salivate\   at the mere thought of eating one its easy to say I was quite intrigued and excited to see that the location nearby my apartment had finally opened. Deciding to stop in for a quick bite before work; I was immediately hit with a good vibe. Decor is well done here. Everything fits the sandwich stop demeanor quite well. Simple menu. Simpler ordering. What could go wrong?  Needless to say things were going well at the start of my experience. It's obvious the store just opened though as the massive crowd of employees; probably being trained; were doing jobs meant for a team half the size. Not a bad thing per say; just an observation.   I decided on getting \  The Wreck;\   a sandwich with salami; roast beef; turkey; ham; and Swiss. An interesting ensemble of deli meats but sonically appetizing nonetheless. Whole grain bread; mayo; hot peppers; lettuce; onions; and tomato are My usual toppings and as such I had all of them put on the sandwich. I really appreciate them being upfront about caloric values of each item of the menu as well.   Service was incredibly smooth. Probably the greatest part of my first Potbelly  experience and I definitely hand it to the management for getting a team that large to function cohesively. Also putting the potato salad in front of the cash register was a clever way to get suckers like me to add one to the order... God knows i couldn't resist.  Unfortunately; I wish I could say the food impressed me nearly as much as the service. First and foremost is the lackluster bread. While I appreciate the bread avoiding the oddly popular \  air bread\   motif places like subway serve; the taste just was not there. Dry; flaky; and dull. Not my cup of tea. The quantity of meat is average for a sandwich shop of this type. Just enough was placed on to assure myself that I wasn't being blatantly ripped off. I just wish the quality of the meat was any good. Before delving in; I pulled one piece of each meat to taste individually from the sandwich itself. Not much to say about it except that if I wanted Hillshire Farms caliber meat I'd make the sandwich myself. Strike two. The lettuce I received was reaching expiration as well. Many of the strands of lettuce had slightly brown edges and my god was there an immense amount of it. Without going into too much more detail I think it's safe to say the sandwich itself was really nothing to write home about. Incredibly average and sometimes subpar components? No thanks. Luckily my potato salad was tasty; but who cares? I came here for the sandwich.   Probably wont be returning here. Potbelly gets three stars only decor and great service. The food however needs some work and since its a chain; I highly doubt the change will ever come. Thankfully I only spent about $7...   ",0.0,0.0

As far as roast beef goes; theirs is solid-flavorful; never dry and it's one of their lower calorie options if you're into that.   I like Potbelly because it's simple-sometimes I don't want to choose from 8 different types of bread and you'll never have to do that here. Their toppings are simple too-lettuce; tomato; hot/sweet peppers; onions; mustard; etc.; but when the quality is there; things don't need to be complicated.   I take off one star for the wait time. While the service is friendly; the wait for one sandwich; even when I take into account the toasting process; is just too long for me.  If you're looking for a good quality sandwich and don't want to make 50 different decisions to do it; Potbelly is your place!,1.0,1.0
0," Yo......  I love In N Out.  I think they are the most consistent place out there; they are inexpensive; fresh and tasty.  That applies for most of them.....this is only the 2nd time out of probably 100s of times that I have been to an In N Out and was not completely impressed.  I placed my usual order of a Double Double with no tomato; both kinds of onions; and an order of fries.  Had a water to drink.  A little over $5.50.  Service was friendly but the food was \off\  .  My burger was not piping hot....the patties were warm but not hot.  The spread was also \  off\  .  I could taste a huge hint of mayo in the spread.  I know its made with mayo but they usually blend/cut that shit so well with the ketchup and relish; you never even get a hint of mayo taste.  I had more than a few bites with straight mayo taste.  It was not good at all.  The produce seemed a little off too.  The onions had a weird \  bite\   to them.  Besides the Goleta In N Out; this was the worst In N Out Burger that I have had.  The fries were pretty good as usual.  Nothing wrong there.  I'm pretty sure I will not come back to this particular one.  The only reason I came here was that it was the closest In N Out to where I was at the time.  Ill drive a few miles up the road and hit up a different one next time.   ",1.0,1.0
0," All my life I've heard that in-n-out is the end all be all of hamburger joints. That there's no way I could any further in my life without visiting one. Every time I go to Vegas I hear \You HAVE to go to In-N-Out\  .   Well we were going to Goodyear Park and wanted to stop here since they were nearby. I'll give it to them; they were packed at 11am on a Saturday.  But I wasn't impressed. The burger and fries were just \  okay\  . Nothing to write home about or that I'd have to tell the world about (which I guess I'm doing right now). I know 5 Guys came after In-N-Out; but I felt like 5 Guys just does it better. You can actually order TOPPINGS. Crazy; I know.  All in all; I'd try them again; but don't know that I'd go out of my way for it.   ",0.0,0.0
0,I have been to In-N-Outs in Cali and in AZ.  My niece from OH was craving it; so we all jump into the car and went.  I ordered the #2 (cheeseburger; fries; and a drink).  They still do not impress me; the cheeseburger was ok.  I love the fries but they have to be eaten fresh.  They taste soggy if you wait too long.

0,Man; I so miss this burger chain living on the east coast.  I've only eaten at one In-N-Out Burger place that was slightly sub-par; and this wasn't it.  Service like at a Chik-fil-a: We were about to sit down and a guy came running over to wipe down the table and seats.  They actually brought us our food.  And the place was packed; so the employees had to be on their toes to do this across the restaurant.  And the food?  The fries are really good; but I miss the burgers so much that I eschew the fries and double down on the double double instead.  If there is a better fast food burger experience; I'm waiting to have it.,1.0,0.0
0,Good burgers and french fries as always!  Don't forget the In-N-Out sauce for your french fries.  We ordered one meal set for cheese burger; another cheese burger and a milkshake.  All that for only $10 :0 Seating could be tough but good service.,1.0,1.0
0,O. M. F'ing. Gee!   It was so good; and delivery was so fast...like faster than freaky fast...it was like Roadrunner fast...or Speedy Gonzales 'ANDALE ANDALE ARRIBA ARRIBA YEE HAW YEE HAW' rapido; or like 'Chip; I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey!' fast...and just as quickly; it was gone.  To be honest; I don't even think the italian beef sandwich; drenched and then smothered in sweet and hot peppers with provolone cheese; even knew what hit it. One moment; it's all safe; warm & cozy in its pot; skillet; oven...wherever italian beef comes from; then BAM! it's whisked off on a whirlwind adventure; delivered and not even 10 minutes later swimming in tummy acid. Happy tummy acid.   To be frank (because I guess I already used 'To Be Honest'); I have enjoyed other tamales w/ chili and cheese a *skosh* better (not bad; but not the best ever); but the italian beef sandwich today has me hooked (plus they have pink lemonade AND deliver; and that ALWAYS makes working Tygers happy).   Lots of delicious sounding stuff on the menu; I'm looking forward to trying the chicago dog and the buffalo bleu fries.   One note to the delivery driver/to-go order specialists/management:   When delivering a giant mess of a sandwich; make sure to also include napkins; fork and knife. Maybe even some of those moist towelettes they give to bbq revelers. While Clinton and Lewinski may think it's cute to have a little mess on a dress; the people I work with do not appreciate it. *  *Just kidding; no dresses were harmed during the scarfing down of this meal.*,1.0,1.0
0," I kept hearing about how great Al's beef was so I knew I had to try it for myself. I looked over the menu and ordered the regular Al (6\) and an order of the buffalo blue fries (Real potatoes drizzled with chunky blue cheese and tangy hot sauce. I would say the Italian beef had a unique taste not sure if that was a good thing. The fries on the other hand kicked ass I would order them again for sure.   ",0.0,0.0
0," What to say?  Meh!  Although it might be 2.5 stars; but it's for sure not 3.  One more place that I can add to my list of things that don't live up to the hype.  Had the Italian Beef and Chicago Dog.  First the beef.  You could tell the beef was pretty good quality and to my surprise there was more than enough of it for my tastes.  We ordered the sandwich dipped so the good news is that it made the bread edible.  Had it not been that way I expect the clearly stale bread would have been on the inedible side.  As for flavor about the only thing you could taste was the dip.  The beef had no discernible flavor on it's own.  Having said that I found the dip to be high on the pepper side and as such I got to taste it for several hours later.  Now the hot dog.  I don't claim to be an expert on Chicago cuisine; but I'm pretty sure a Chicago dog includes  celery salt.  None here...nada; zip; zero.  Oddly enough that little missing ingredient makes a lot of difference.  The dog also comes with fries.  Now most places on the planet the fries come on a separate plate/bag/cup/whatever.  Not here.  Fries come wrapped in the paper that contains the dog.  I wasn't digging this little innovation.  There are all kinds of signs/posters in the place telling you about how good the sandwich is and who says so.  Also on one of those TV food/travel channel competitions the beef sandwich was named the winner for the midwest region as the best sandwich in America.  As of this writing the overall winner hasn't been named but if the beef sandwich comes even remotely close to winning; I'm going to throw my TV out the window.    This place isn't even remotely close to where I live; but since I was in the neighborhood we stopped in.  I wouldn't make a special trip; but I might give it a try again (just to see if I can \get it\  ) if I'm ever back in the neighborhood.   ",0.0,0.0
0,WOW!!  The new owners of the Al's on Northsight have it down pat! My beef was perfect; as authentic Chicago as it gets (and that's coming from a REAL Chicagoan). My wife loved the fact that they've added salads and wraps. Now I can bring her more often. We were surrounded by great people; great service; and smiling faces. Kudos to the new owners.  Great job!!,1.0,1.0
0,I went to Al's today. The place is clean and the seating is good. The soda fountain is in a weird spot though. I ordered the Nacho fries and a Chicago dog with fries.   Chicago dog. I liked how it was made. There wasn't so much stuff in it that it all fell out every time you take a bite. I hate that when dogs are served that way. Also; I liked that the fries were stuffed in the dog bun along with some onions sport peppers and mustard. I didn't like they dog itself so much; It tasted alright but had a chewiness to it. I might have to try a couple more just to make sure. I give it a 4.   The Nacho fries. A lot of places make custom fries like this but I never had fries that had such a good taste to them. I don't know if my taste buds were playing tricks on me; but I could of sworn near the end of my nacho fries I tasted a sweet Bavarian cream donut taste. Kinda weird huh. I don't know how it got there but I want it again and again.  I give it a 5.   Tomorrow I'm going back to try the beef and maybe the Buffalo bleu fries. If the Beef turns out right I'll have to up the stars.  Ok I've been back like 30 times and have had 30 beefs. I thinks that about sums it up. I even like the smell it puts in my mustache. Sometimes I'll leave it in so a few hours later I can remember just how good lunch was today.,1.0,0.0
0," Al's Beef in Chicago was never one of my regular places that I ventured to to grab an Italian beef. There are so many other small \ma & pa\   places that I pretty much passed Al's up. That being said; I at least got to try it in Scottsdale!  I ordered a sausage and beef combo with hot giardiniera and some fries. The fries were decent - crispy and salty. The giardiniera was great; and definitely looked and tasted like it was taken out of a big pot in back rather than a big jar from a wholesale store. The beef was also tasty and definitely seemed like it had been marinating in its juices for a couple hours. Everything was pretty good until the sausage. The sausage was an alright link; but it wasn't hot; it was cooling off. From \  order up\   to table to mouth is all it took; seemingly. I really like my hot sandwiches piping hot; especially when that sandwich is an Italian beef (hybrid). Shite happens unfortunately though; and at least the flavors were pretty good.   I'd give Al's another go. It passes; but didn't win me over.   ",0.0,0.0
0,After a friend raved about the food; we decided to try Al's.  My husband ordered the beef sandwich; which he said was okay.  I ordered a hot dog; which was disappointing.  It was small and not satisfying (and I am usually a light eater).  The atmosphere is good though (clean and no customer service complaints).  We were really hoping to be blown away by the food and were disappointed that is was just okay.  Our comparison is Dickie's Dogs at McDowell Mountain Ranch.

We made a stop right before heading to the airport and my breakfast burrito of ham and cheese was simple; but great. And the strawberry smoothie I had along with it really hit the spot.   The popcorn chicken we saved to eat on the plane was ok; the Toaster chicken sandwich was better; but both probably should be eaten piping hot.  And can I just say - what better idea than to order and have food brought to your car in the winter in New England? Brillant; I'm telling you I should open a franchise!,0.0,1.0
0," During my time living in Maryland I've seen a good deal of Sonic commercials on the tele.  Being that I have never seen a Sonic; I was perplexed by these commercials.  So; using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren't any Sonics in the state of Maryland.  When I moved to my new home of San Diego; I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?  One night; my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \What the fvck's a Sonic?\   I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light; as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.  Now; I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to; but to this; my virgin Sonicage; I can.  There is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs; drinks; slushies; smoothies; ice cream sundaes; banana splits; etc.  As if this wasn't enough; they also have a drive-thru.  Again my perplexion returned.  The awful shine of it all; the harshness on weary eyes... It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.  While we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.  Jen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n' cheese bites; I; the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral; waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.  Got home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn't make one's flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.  The drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n' cheese.  Sadly; these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese; eh; not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.  ...and that was and is how I met a Sonic.

0,What a cool way to buy fast food during a heatwave; late at night in your jammies; or any time.  Daughter was hungry for a Sonic burger#1.   Spotted a Sonic sign ahead. We pulled into the parking lot of a fast food joint. Colorful 3' x 4' screens separated each parking space on the driver's side.   I immediately recognized the old car hop vibe. Pulled into an empty space. Kept the engine running and air condition blasting. The screen turned out to be the menu; speaker; and ATM all in one. WHAT?!?!?! How innovative.  Scanned the menu for items I wanted to order.  Pressed the speaker button to alert the assistant inside that I was ready to order. A very pleasant; disembodied voice took my order; then said she'd be out in a few with my order. Ok; let's see how fast . . .   In the meantime I inserted my credit card to finalize the transaction. Receipt rolled out.  As promised; within minutes a sweet young lady arrived balancing a red tray loaded with 2 paper bags and a couple of drinks. She confirmed my order according to the receipt printed out on her side; then she handed over my booty.  Handed her a tip and I was on my way with a Sonic burger & fries; classic hot dog with the works; condiments; a limeade and a blue coconut slush and 2 peppermint candies. Yaowzaaaaa!  No Sonic anywhere near where I live; but when they show up I'll be one of the first in line. Love their vibe.  http://www.sonicdrivein.com/,1.0,0.0

0,After living out west for ages; I moved to San Antonio.  Home to ZERO In-N-Out Burgers!  It was a long few years; but now I am here in Phoenix; and I have been reunited with my old flame.    We picked up just where we left off.  You would never know we hadn't seen or heard from one another in four years.  I took hold of the hot; fresh; juiciness and went to town.  After a few short minutes; it was over.  I wiped the remaining secret sauce from my face.  All I could think about was when we would do it again.....  It will be soon; I assure you it will.  Here are a few of the reasons why In-N-Out gets a solid for stars from me. -There are no microwaves; heat lamps or freezers -They use additive; preservative and filler free beef -The fries are fresh cut all day long -The shakes are made from real ice cream -This is a private; family owned company; with no plans to go public or franchise -The employees smile and make you feel like your business is appreciated.    It is always packed; so be prepared to wait a few minutes.  If you like crispy fries; be sure to order them well done.  If you don't eat meat; order a grilled cheese (prepared on meat-free cooking surface).  Learn the secret In-N-Out lingo; or just order your burger animal style...,1.0,0.0
0," This place tops my chart as the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. Having just been released from the hospital and given the okay to eat whatever I wanted; I fast tracked it to the nearest fast food joint I could find to grab a quick meal.   I was initially greeted with; \What do you want?\   I brushed this aside despite it being overly rude and attempted to order food for my family. I say \  attempted\   because; for the first time in my life; I didn't make it past the drive-thru speaker.   While ordering; the lady taking my order began speaking with another employee about prices. About 15 seconds of this went on before she returned to speaking with me.   Having just waited for her to have a conversation that could've waited the 15 seconds it would have taken me to place my order; she begins speaking to me in a rushed manner. \  Do you want your combo 'this style; this style; or this style'? Size? What to drink?\   Not only was this the icing on the cake for me; but I looked at my fiance to make sure that I wasn't in the wrong. Her look was also that of disbelief. I calmly told the lady that she was being \  f***ing rude\   and left for what turned out to be a Burger King down the road. Despite the BK's slower than usual service; it was 10x better than what I received at this place.   All-in-all: This place marks the first time that I was unable to make it past the ordering phase at any fast food location.

0,This place has good food; great service;  it is friendly and clean.  All of the Chipotle's that I have eaten at have been very good; except for one in downtown Washington DC where a group of kids ran through the dining room chased by police officers.  They trashed the place; and spilled a perfume display that one of the kids was trying to sell.  Which may have been why the police were chasing them I don't know.  What I do know is the perfume smelled terrible.  Anyway back to Chandler.  The good thing about Chipotle is the menu.  It is very simple.  Basically you walk up to the counter and tell the nice person what you want to eat.  All the food is displayed in front of you.  You can mix and match it any way you like.  Tacos; burritos;   even melted cheese things that aren't on the menu but kids seem to love them.    There are a few different kinds of meat.  Carnetias or braised pork; grilled chicken; and two different kinds of beef.  One grilled the other BBQed.  Fresh green peppers and onions lightly seasoned and sauteed but still crispy.  Two kinds of beans; pinto and black.  The servers are quick to tell you that the pinto beans are not for strict vegetarians or the kosher crowd.    Rice seasoned with a little cilantro that is very tasty; and last but not least delicious guacamole.  As your meal (usually a burrito for me) is assembled it moves down the counter to the salsa section.  There are a few different kinds of salsa.  A spicy red one; I don't know what is in it but it is my favorite.  A tomato; onion; cilantro mild one.  Corn relish that goes in my burrito too; and a green one that I never tired.  Then some sour cream and cheese and they magically roll it and wrap it in a tin foil sleeve.    With really good food places it is the little things that can make or break them.  For example sour cream.  Pretty basic stuff right.  At Chipolte it is delectable.  I can't find sour cream near as good at any grocery store.  The tortillas are big and seem to stretch enough to wrap whatever they put in the burrito.  Did I mention that these burritos are really big?  If you don't want to go the tortilla route they will make your burrito in a bowl.  Same stuff just no tortilla.  I once ate at the Chipolte in Lawrence Kansas with a friend.  She ate two burritos.  She is a freak; don't try it you may explode.    They seem to be proud of their chips.  Most places offer them free of charge.  Chipolte charges for them.  They could be good I've never had them; but lot's of folks order them.      No doubt about it this is fast food.  I stopped by last Tuesday at noon.  Just before I walked in 14 giggling high school kids ran up in front of me.  The line was to the door.  Ten minutes later I was at the counter watching my burrito grow.  Amazing.  Just because it is fast food doesn't mean it has to taste bland or be cold.     This place is not cheap.  Eight and a half bucks for a burrito and a small drink.  I'll keep looking for a better burrito.  Till I find one Chipotle sets the bar.,1.0,1.0
0,The food always speaks for itself...awesome! But I was much more impressed by the customer service. I am Gluten-Free; and made a request for a large order to be gluten free...during the dinner-time rush hour. The line of about 4 people behind me grew to about 50 people; but the Chipotle crew ensured my gluten-free meal by exchanging all utensils and doing everything else they could to make sure that none of my food came in contact with anything that could have had prior contact with gluten. Despite my order taking about 15 minutes to be completed (because securing a gluten free environment in a restaurant can be pain-stakeningly difficult); the whole crew had nothing but smiles and kindness toward me. I was very impressed and think that all of them definitely deserve raises for such great customer service. Give your business to people who are happy to give good service!,1.0,1.0

0,I used to be afraid of foil wrapped burritos after a painful experience a few years ago.  So; I would usually get the crispy tacos here or if I did order a burrito I would perform an airport-security like check of all the folds and creases after removing the foil.  Now that I have had all my old metal fillings replaced I can eat their burritos without having a mild anxiety attack but I still prefer the tacos for lunch because of the smaller portion size.  Either way it's darn good fast food.  If you were born after 1980; you probably have no idea what I am talking about.,0.0,0.0

Clearly; they were extremely busy; and despite that; I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me; as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.    I also really like how thier menu's set up.

0," Oh Chipotle; what's not to love honestly?  Great quality ingredients that you can have thrown together in a completely customizable meal; it's hard to go wrong with that set up.  I managed to stop in at a rare time when they didn't have a huge line and made my way up to the counter.  The people behind the counter greeted me with a smile and a \hello\   right away; and proceeded right away to get my order taken care of.  The girl who rang me up was very friendly too and even put a smiley face on my container!  Call me a sucker for the small stuff but I love things like that!   ",1.0,1.0
0," Chipotle is the best business model of the 21st Century; and this location wholly embodies the Chipotle perfection.  Chipotle uses naturally raised meats; hormone free dairy; no eggs or nuts; organic beans; seasonal produce; and promote recycling within the restaurants. This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)  Their simple menu makes ordering easy; but still allows you variety (Burrito; Salad; Tacos; Bowls) and caters to a carnivore; vegetarian; or vegan. In fact; they are pretty ood-allergy\   safe in general. (Believe me; I have experience)  As if the food wasn't enough; they have two amazing ordering systems: Iphone App and Online Ordering. Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute; because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:  I run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around; my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous; but believe me; it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering.   Anyway; I go online; login; and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order; the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures; places for memos; etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.  Once everyone has ordered; I hit submit; pay by credit card; and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle; give them a jingle; and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the \  valet\   service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!  Chipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well; delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)  I want to take a second to recognize this particular location; on 54th Street. Let me start by saying; I believe that you can taste the love in food... as in; if someone is cranky as shit; making your food; it is not as good as if they are smiling; enjoying their lives. I know this probably sounds crazy; but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE!   Oh; and about two hours after pickup; someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award; this location deserves it!  My final note: I get the salad with black beans; rice; tomato salsa; green tomatillo salsa; and guacamole. 100% vegan; 100% delicious. Under 500 calories; 17g of fat; and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full.   Since I have started eating Chipotle 3-4 times a week; I have actually started losing weight. Perhaps I will be the next Jared!   ",1.0,1.0
0,Pretty sure most people have eaten at a Chipotle at some point .  So this review is for location instead of the food; which is pretty consistently good if you want burritos and guacamole.  This location is close so I go quite a bit. It tends to have long lines at odd times for no reason; and the parking is pretty terrible.  I would suggest parking outside of the little lot area it shares with the other stores.  The staff is always nice and friendly.  Although now the online ordering makes you wait even if there is no one in line.  So you should use that over just showing up since standing there now means very little.,1.0,1.0
0,This place is insanely good.  WHY ARE THERE NO CUSTARD BURGER JOINTS IN L.A.???  The original Freddy's special with everything on it and fries hits the spot every single time.    The service here is some of the most energetic and friendly that I've ever come across; too.  I mean; yesterday the owner himself was going around talking to people; making sure they were content.  You don't find that every day.,1.0,1.0
0,This was my first trip to Freddy's in probably close to a year...not because I don't like it; but my wife is a bigger fan of Culver's.  I had a meeting that evening that caused me to miss at home dinner time and decided to hit up Freddy's for my dinner.  This was my first time through the drive-thru; all other visits had been inside.  Drive-thru; even though there was a steady stream of cars; was fairly quick.    I ordered a double California Burger; with fries and a soda.  Now; I'll be honest; this was a few weeks back; and the fries and soda weren't that memorable...but the burger was fantastic.  Seemed meatier than normal (maybe that is in comparison to the usual Culver's burger?) and the taste was great.  Cooked as good as a fast-food burger can be cooked.    Oh Freddy's; I like you so; hopefully I can ditch my wife more often to dine on your delicious burgers!,0.0,0.0
0," I wanted to like Freddy's a lot more than I did. Prob 2.5 stars; really; but I appreciate the variety on the menu; and that they're offering something a little different.  That being said; I didn't really care for what they're offering.   The menu pics make a \Steakburger\   (quotes are quite necessary in this case!) look like thinly sliced pieces of steak/beef; kind of like a thicker unprocessed version of the glued together mass that Arby's cuts into their thin slices.  But that's not at all what it is; as there's nothing \  steak\   about it. Imagine taking an already thin; very basic hamburger patty and smashing it down with a meat tenderizing hammer so that it tapers to a super thin edge. You know all of those little fat bubbles that usually accumulate on the top side of an unflipped burger?  In a \  Steakburger\   all of those fat bubbles congeal together between the gound beef bits; on the grill side not the top; into a solid; slightly crispy layer of meat/fat. It's so thin that they have to offer you two patties as the basic; with options of one or three patties on the menu; too.  A normal burger does not include lettuce & tom; you pay extra for that.   My personal taste is that thicker is better for fries; as long as they're not limp; gimme steak fries every time.  I thought Freddy's Steakburger would have steak fries; but they actually have shoestring fries.  The seasoning was good; but the flavor of potato is so lost in grease and salt that it was kind of heavy on the belly quickly.  The worse part was that it was actually very annoying having to repeatedly dunk them in ketchup and move them to my mouth. I'm not usually such a lazy eater (~!~)(Stoopid Amehr-i-KAHNs) but I had to opt for a fork.  These would make nice chili fries; I guess. Didn't bother with custard. Service stank; too; as I waited about 3 minutes with no acknowledgement even though there were employees busy right in front of me  making desserts.  I guess they weren't authorized for bare-customer contact.  A drive thru guy eventually came to take the order; but as soon as he stepped up to me; he began talking to the person in the drive thru and walked away; gesturing to someone I couldn't see around the corner.  A shaggy haired dude pushing a mop bucket came into view; saying \  I'll try; but it's been a while\   as he walked up to the register.  Guy's like 17; how long could it have been?  A manager looking guy  stepped in front of young shaggy mop amnesia fellow; a different shirt color was my only clue to his title; not skill level; that's fo' sho'.   ",0.0,0.0

0,Okay...I have been here once. But I was in town visiting and heard from a few peeps that this spot was worth checking out. When we finally found it; we strolled in. Digging the old school atmosphere! Placed our order and we waited; giddy like schoolgirls. I had a patty melt; my lady friend had the PM with 'shrooms on it; and her mom had a burger. Everything looked AWESOME when it arrived. The meat is great; totally different from anything you get from any fast food joint. (Yuck). The little shoestring fries were GREAT! I usually prefer bigger fries; hell; even sometimes curly or smothered in chili; but these little guys were great. Matter of fact; I was here a little over 2 weeks ago and still haven't had fries from anywhere else. No thanks. All in our group loved their food. Next time I am in town; we are going back. Also; the worms n dirt was great as well. That frozen custard is a must-try.,0.0,0.0
0," Dude; why have I never heard of this place before! Oh; because they don't have any in California . . . damn.   Like others have said; this is an In & Out Equivalent; but in my humble opinion; I think Whataburger is better. You get more food for the same price and better service.  And the burger tastes more eal\   than In and Out (Sorry to those who think that is blasphemous).    My boyfriend and I went here twice on our visit to Tempe.  Gotta load up on the goods while we can!   ",0.0,1.0
0,Forget the fact that virtually all fast food tastes like heaven after a long night of partying. I've been to this location in varying states of intoxication and they have always provided top notch customer service; even though its 3:30am; I'm probably still drunk and probably talking too loud or not making much sense. The people there always have a big smile and treat all their customers very very well. I would recommend this place to any college student in a late night quest for greasy; tasty; delicious food.  The one thing I would recommend is that you specify that your chicken is fresh; and by that I mean that it hasnt been sitting in the warmer for any longer than 5minutes. However that is something you should do at every fast food place.,1.0,0.0

0,While I wait for the fine people at Chipotle to finally wise up and build a location north of the Loop 101; this one is the closest to my home in Desert Ridge.  With a craving for a burrito bowl; and Chipotle's easy online ordering; I put in my girlfriend and my usual order (which was originally made for another location by our old home) with a single click and drove down to PV Mall.  There's nothing that really sets this Chipotle apart from the others.  It has the typical look and feel of every other Chipotle ever built.  The food is the usual quality I have come to expect from this quick service chain.  My only real put off was that my order was not ready on time.  The confirmation email said our food would be ready by 8:10pm.  I walked in at 8:12; skipped the line and went to register; waited for the person paying to finish; then told the cashier that I was there for my online order.  It hadn't even been made yet.  The staff quickly put it together in less than five minutes; which allowed me to jump ahead of three or four people who had been waiting; but that also means if I just left my home earlier; it would've taken about the same amount of time.  Not the worst thing to ever happen; but it does defeat half the purpose of online ordering.  Having said that; here's a tip for all the people who complain about the long line at lunch time.  This location is right outside a mall surrounded by a ton of apartment complexes; retail centers; and office buildings.  It's going to be busy.  Order your food on chipotle.com (there's also a fax form on the website; or call ahead; if you're old school) and skip over all the people who did not plan ahead.  If they screw up and don't make your order right away like they did with me; they'll drop everything and make it.   No need to feel like a jerk.  You're now just smarter than the other customers who are now mad at you.  You're welcome.,1.0,1.0

0," This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I Understand that they get busy but I've been to many locations with long lines that move quickly. This location however; is the SLOWEST one in the world.   The line is always to the door and you can expect to wait 15-20 minutes before paying. Most of the workers are soooo slow. Each time I've been in they are always low on meat or guacamole and you have to stand there and wait minutes for it to be replaced.   Also the parking is horrible. The \lot\   is super tiny. Tonight there was no parking available and I had to park across the street at the mall and walk over.   All in all I'm done coming here. I'd rather drive to 7th and Bell for good service and parking.   ",0.0,0.0
0,In my opinion; you can never go wrong with Chipotle. It's quick; tasty; and they use all natural ingredients. The steak burrito bowl is my absolute fav; their steak has a nice spiciness to it. Their staff has always been friendly and inviting every time I walk through the door.   You can also order online before and pick it up at a certain time at your local Chipotle. The tacos are also great if you're a taco fan. If you order a meal with a drink it usually comes out to about $10; and without the drink you're getting a great bang for your buck!   A great choice when looking for a satisfying; quick; hearty meal.,1.0,1.0
0,Every Chipotle I have ever been to has always had a line out the door; so it's expected every time I go. Despite the long lines; service is usually pretty quick. This is the SLOWEST Chipotle I have ever been to. The employees had no sense of urgency at all. I have never seen anyone scoop beans or rice that slow before.  When it time to pay; there was no cashier... She was refilling napkins that didn't need to be refilled at the time. After she rang the guy in front of me; she turned and jumped to bring bags of chips down from the top shelf to the bottom shelf.. There were already chips on the bottom shelf and she completely ignored me and the huge line behind me. Employees don't seem to know how to prioritize! Also; the parking lot is huge; but the way it is laid out provides hardly any spaces and makes it really difficult to drive/park in.,0.0,0.0

0,A whole wheat mini #7; please. Hold the cheese. With spicy mustard; lettuce; tomato and jalapeño. That's about 410 calories and makes me oh; so happy after a workout at the gym.   I love that they slice your meat for you when you order it and all of the toppings are really fresh. I also like that it's a pretty simple set up. There's something like 15 sandwich options; with some hot; some wrapped and others on subs. You can also have a sandwich in a dish if you're gluten free.   I'm a big fan. I also like the rewards program. You get points for every sandwich you purchase and eventually they earn you a free sammich! Heck yeah!,0.0,1.0
0,My boyfriend is in love with Firehouse so I eat there quite a bit. In terms of quality they blow away Subway; Quiznos; etc. Their subs are also quite large; and the hot sauce collection is amusing. I tried the DBacks hot sauce as a joke; and actually found it to be quite tasty. At the same time; I realized I do like hot sauce on my sandwiches. Who knew? Thanks; Firehouse!  I give them four out of five stars for two reasons: 1. One night they gave me the hard sell on the brownies and I caved. They were not anything special. Don't bother. 2. The last time I was there they took way too long to make one sub and there were six people working behind the counter. In addition; two people that ordered after me got their food first. That is seriously irritating.   Definitely a nice alternative to other sandwich chains.,0.0,1.0
0,I think these guys have one of the best hot subs around. I differentiate hot and cold subs because they are completely different sandwiches. There are places in town that have great cold subs but Firehouse has one of the best hot subs around. I don't think there is a bad one on the menu. I love the Italian and the New York Steamer with corned beef and pastrami but the meatball; turkey bacon ranch; club; Engineer are all great. Every time you walk in you are greeted. Now granted sometimes are more exuberant than others. Sometimes you get WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE! and sometimes you get WELCOME to fireh... but you are greeted. Even after that they still remain friendly. They will explain things if you have never been there before or if you have questions. It is always nice and clean and the soda machine is never running low. The one little knock against them is the price. It is a little expensive but so worth it. So much better than some $5 piece of junk. Every once in awhile you get a craving and it is a nice indulgence. It also makes you feel good to round up your order and donate the change to firefighters. I like that little touch too and think more people should do it. Sure it is just change but it is going toward a great cause. I will keep coming back and have a hard time picking which sandwich I want because they are all so good. They get an extra point for having a Coke Freestyle machine. Those are the best.,1.0,1.0
0,These guys are the absolute best. The sandwiches speak for themselves but the service is the best in the valley. It's definitely the exception to the rule the way these guys go out of their way to help out and treat their customers right. Above and beyond - they have me as a life time customer. Thank you!,1.0,1.0
0,First; let me just say that I believe Firehouse Subs is by far the best sandwich shop in the world; and the New York Steamer (with extra meat; twice toasted) is quite possibly the single greatest accomplishment that mankind can ever hope to achieve.  Also; I am in no way affiliated with Firehouse Subs; though opening up a shop would probably be the greatest thing ever. I would be in absolute heaven if I could eat a sandwich from Firehouse Subs for every meal; every day; for the rest of my life.   I am reviewing this location in Chandler; AZ because; 1) I am moving to Phoenix so I will soon be a frequent diner; and 2) the service is absolutely perfect. I have been to this specific location four times; though I lived next to one in Florida for two years and have consumed more sandwiches from that Firehouse location than most people would consume in their lifetime (at any sandwich shop). The staff is extremely nice (the gentleman that made my sandwich even remembered my name and sandwich order; after only the first visit!; granted I returned the same day; but still :P); and the shop was clean; and there was plenty of staff to take my order quickly.  My sandwich (the New York Steamer; which I usually always order; though I have had all their sandwiches plenty of times); was absolutely perfect and tasted just like I remembered in Florida. The sweet and savory steamed meat; cheese; and sauces lovingly placed between the two slices of toasted bread form a taste unlike any other. The bread is amazing; it's soft; yet toasted enough to where it crackles when grasping the sub; and the process of steaming the meat releases flavors that are unmatched at any other sandwich establishment. I have no issues stating that Firehouse Subs is the absolute best sandwich shop in existence. If you disagree; well; enjoy your inferior subs...more Firehouse for me!  If you are looking for an awesome place to eat; look no further than Firehouse Subs.,1.0,1.0
0,Firehouse Subs is delicious. You really can't go wrong here. Fresh bread; good quality cold cuts and melt in your mouth cheese. I have recently discovered the New York Steamer which is pastrami and corned beef with provolone and Italian dressing all melted together. It goes especially well with a nice chipotle sauce from the great selection of hot sauces from the counter and also some nice crunchy jalapeno kettle chips.   The special choose from a bunch o' drinks coke machine is pretty cool too; although I get a little overwhelmed and never know what I want. Service has always been great and the tables are always clean even when it's busy. The best time to come during the week is 2pm-3pm to avoid the crazy lunch or dinner rush. Overall Firehouse is delicious; I will be back.,1.0,1.0
0,I tried this place out on the recommendations of the Chandler Fire people I work with; since they offered a free sub on your birthday; and yesterday was my birthday. I tried the Engineer; which is smoked turkey with grilled mushrooms. It was good; but a little small for an almost $7 sandwich. I had the medium and it was only slightly larger than a hot dog bun; but the ingredients were fresh and good. The service was a little slow considering they had 7 people behind the counter; and a manger greeting people. I took more than10 minutes to get my sandwich; and since I was in line for 5 minutes that doesn't leave much time to eat if you're on a half hour lunch break.,0.0,1.0
0," I went to Firehouse for the first time this past weekend. The place was clean and I enjoyed the decor.   The sandwiches were very good and fresh. The brisket and cheddar sandwich was really good. I also split the engine company sub with my fiancee and enjoyed the sandwich. The sandwiches were made within 5 minutes of the order.  I liked the crushed ice instead of the cube you typically get at most eating esablishments.   I didn't find the food too expensive. The cost for 2 sandwich combos was $16-17.  About what you would pay at Dilly's.  I expect I will hear \Welcome to Firehouse\   in the future.   ",0.0,1.0
0,First of all; kudos to a sandwich shop for being open until 10 pm. I was very impressed with my first firehouse subs experience and have been very satisfied with my repeat visits. The subs are always delicious and best served nice and hot. Their meatballs are fantastic and my picky one year old daughter loves them.   My wife and I find the mustard that they use to be way too strong and tends to overpower the sandwich. We always ask for our subs without the mustard; but maybe that's just us. The service has been great and they have been very helpful meeting the dining needs of my little ones every time. Bonus points for having the coke freestyle machine; but where's the ginger ale?!?!?!  Love this place. We will be returning often.,1.0,1.0
0," I'm not saying Pei Wei is the best asian food I've ever tasted; far from it; it's a fairly large chain that puts on the appearance of something more refined; it's essentially to Asian food what Olive Garden is to Italian Food.  With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei; the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized; the food is generally consistent; and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name \panda express\   (which is overpriced crap)  the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered; I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home; I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant; when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me; the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag; and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had; and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)  I must say I was impressed with this manager; and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially \  un-F$@k's\   your food and returns it to you.

The man running the cash register was not exactly friendly. The 3 of us had one order of Walleye and 2 orders of fried chicken. He yelled into the back to find out if they had more fried chicken (it was 6pm on a Saturday). Finding out they did; he said we could have the chicken. When our orders came one plate had two large chicken breasts and the other had a spindly wing and drumstick. Everything was super oily; even by the standards of fried fast food. The breading on the chicken was bland and heavy. Hubby said the walleye was decent but bland. Fries were frozen crinkle fries. I didn't try the roll and didn't hear any commentary on the green beans. The cole slaw was apparently decent but sweet (Miracle Whip).  Although the desserts look intriguing; I probably wouldn't come here again for food.,0.0,1.0

The fish was decent but really wasn't cooked all the way through.  I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  I was expecting something like Ivars and got some runny cioppino-like stew.  It was really bad until I salted the hell out of it.  Then; it got strangely addictive and I couldn't stop eating it.    Really weird.

First impressions - I was really disappointed that there wasn't more of a pub atmosphere.  The interior is very close to being fast food; and not even as nice as some.  You order at a counter and the food is delivered to your table.  I would agree with the earlier reviewers on some things.  I ordered the large portion of the Cod fish & chips.  I thought the portion size and the fish were quite good.  The batter was crispy and not greasy.  The chips were terrible though.  They were limp; soggy and tasted as if the oil should have been changed about two weeks ago.  I also had some shrimp which were good; but not outstanding.  I too was put off by the cheap 
ickel and dime\   approach - $.25 for more tartar sauce????  And I didn't like the $.35 surcharge for using my debit card.  I thought for a minute I was at ARCO's fish and chips!!

When we walked in; I was a little confused at the setup; but it kind of grew on me.  It was very clearly a mom and pop style place; and I can definitely appreciate that.  The decor was pretty awful; but endearing at the same time.  I'm not sure why they were trying to cover up their wood tabletops with awful cheap tablecloths; but to each their own.  I also liked their impressive selection of British foodstuffs.  I wasn't too hungry; so I ordered the smaller portion of the cod and chips.  I really liked that they gave you the option to order a little less.  Maybe I was under the wrong impression that this should be a faster service restaurant because you order at a counter and pay at the counter; but our food took forever to get out to us.  The unfortunate things was seeing the cook put our fries onto our plate well before the fish made it.  That left us with lukewarm fries.  The fries; well; they sucked.  They weren't the crispy kind and they weren't salted at all.  The fish; I hate to say it; was disgusting.  It was over-battered and wasn't cooked long enough.  That left me with a nasty mess of mush all over my fish.  I had to scrape it all of to be edible.  Since this place calls themselves the Codfather; and I wasn't pleased with what is supposedly their specialty; I certainly don't see myself coming back.,0.0,0.0
0,We go here once every few months.  The beer is great and they have a good selection.  The decor seems to struggle to find itself; but if the food is really good; who cares what it looks like.  They have added table service; which was not so great; but the beer was good; so......  Always get the cod fish and chips.  It all seems to cost more than it should; but I don't mind if I am supporting a local business.  The only thing I will remember is to face away from the kitchen space; because you can see everything they are doing in there; it's a bit unnerving and I don't care for having to ask for a key to the restroom.,0.0,1.0
0,Been here a few times in the past. Once when they first opened. On my last visit the place was bigger and now serving alcohol. Maybe that is the best way to enjoy this place to the fullest?  This is a British style restaurant with Fish and Chips the way they make it back home. My Son-in-law is from England and he LOVES this place. They have several popular items that you would get overseas. Mushy Peas; Bangers / Mash / Gravy; Bubble/Bangers/Beans and many others.  Inside is decorated with everything you would expect if you were vacationing in GB. They also have a nice market with items that you may not find in your typical grocery store.  We have had the Cod; Haddock; Jalapeno Poppers (LOL) and looking forward to possibly trying the Walleye in a future lifetime.  The food is somewhat bland tasting to my palate. Maybe that is how they like it over there. The fish seems a little more greasy than we would prefer and a napkin is needed to soak up the excess. Hmmm?  Service is friendly and the dining experience and menu are worth checking out. Would have to say that there are better places for Fish in my opinion. But then again ... this is how they do it over in the Queen's backyard. TALLY HO!  3 STARS,1.0,0.0
0," The fish they use is high quality; you can see and taste it but that is about it for positive comments. We went on the 1st Friday of Lent and the place was packed. We saw a 2 top table at the bar so we grabbed it. The table was greasy and dirty; complete with a dollop of tartar sauce smack dab in the middle. The miserable bartender sluggishly came over and took our order. I guess we had to run a tab since we were sitting in the bar area bc she took our credit card when we ordered. No big deal except she when she brought it back she slapped it down right on top of the tartar sauce spill left on the center of the table. She either didn't notice or didn't care that the table was filthy bc she never wiped it down for us and she was so ornery looking we were afraid to ask her to do it for us. We were not in a crazy hurry to eat but the people around us were getting restless. Apparently; some of them had been waiting for over an hour for their order. Now; I try to be as understanding as possible but seriously? It doesn't take that long to fry fish. The nasty bartender just replied to the complaining customers that the kitchen got slammed with orders and it was taking a long time. No apology just an excuse. Ok; I get it ;they got hit with a bunch of orders at once. They were busy; I understand;  it was the first Friday of Lent but of course they were busy!!!! It is a fish restaurant on the 1st Friday of Lent! One would think that the owners would have planned their staffing a bit differently. We got our food and the bf loved his but mine was cold. On the way to the bathroom; I nearly slid to my death on a smashed french fry  or \chip\   because none of the staff bothered to pick it or any of the other trash up off the floor. The bathroom is locked and you have to get a key (on a hanger) from the cashier. What kind of legit restaurant locks their bathroom like a gas station? The place is disgusting; the service is terrible; and the food is inconsistent. I don't think we'll be making a follow up trip to the Codfather.   ",0.0,0.0

0," My Wife and I went yesterday around 11:45 a.m. for lunch with high expectations... That was our first error... The second was ordering food... As a teenager many many years ago I worked at a place called Bit Of England Fish and Chips in Tarzana Ca. Well the best thing eaten yesterday were the Malt Vinegar Onions... They were great; but that's where the greatness ENDS... We ordered the Onion Rings and my wife said;\Do you taste any onion? I know it was there but tasteless. The batter was light. Then we ordered a Large order of Cod And Catfish... The Chips(fries) were good. The Fish had a taste; unfortunately it was a taste of grease and no fish taste. The Catfish was a little better than the Cod. There was a greasy film left in my mouth that was a lingering memory. Still no one beats Pier 83 or George and the Dragon...service was good; but don't understand why they incur labor cost of a wait staff when you should be able to walk up to a counter and order.. Another 15%-18% wasted... If service is decent or good we never penalize the wait staff for lousy food; they didn't cook it...   ",1.0,0.0

0," Food was a 4 Decor was a 3 Music on Tuesday 4.5  Hey; I stopped by this authentic British Fish N Chips joint last night and was surprised that I could not find a spot near the restaurant  entrance to park at the parking lot was full and this was a small strip center on Bell road with retail and service stores that were all closed. The place was relatively full for a Tuesday night at 7PM...more on that.  Since I felt like having authentic \Fish and Chips\   the very nice lady behind the counter says \  What kind of fish\  ? They have traditional Cod and Halibut and Salmon and Corvina. Plus Shrimp and Scallops and a lot more.Well in as much as I have been trying to minimize the fried foods in my life; I felt that I was down a Quart of Oil....so what the heck. Hey I just ran the 1/2 marathon last week; so go for it.   Had a piece of cod and the scallops as well and an order of onion rings. I must say; I was impressed with the fish and scallops. Very crispy cod and a nice portion as well. I had 10 scallops ($6.00) which are scallops and nothing else but for $6.00. Pretty good.  Was not impressed with the miniscule serving of tartar sauce and it's $.25 extra per serving (about a tablespoon). Well I must admit I like a little fish with my Tartar sauce. Don't get me wrong; I was impressed with the flavor of the food. I guess I just had too much oil. Maybe that's why I did not like the onion rings as much. They were good but by now; I reached my limit of oil.Again; fish is expensive and these portions were very nice.  Here's the biggest surprise and would have given The Codfather another 1/2 star if Yelp allowed half stars which I guess they don't. It's open mike Tuesday and there was a pretty decent band playing. 4 pieces; Banjo; bass; 2 guitars. After a few sets; a duet with a gal and guitar and a guy playing a mandolin were next. Pretty good; gave the place a nice buzz; people were listening and it was an added bonus to my Tuesday meal.   Finally....Thursday night these Brits open it up to an Irish Band (Raic) and I'm going to go...for some food and music. A very nice surprise in N. Phoenix. They might get to 4 stars soon.   all the best   ",1.0,1.0
0,I've been here 4 times before they had full-service & now with the friendly service staff. Each time we've been there; food has always been the best.

0,I came here with my wife and daughter for a late lunch on the 6th.   We have been itching to get some good fish and chips and this place fit the bill. I had been here before ages ago and remembered it as being very good. Luckily; my memory was good. This place was awesome!  My wife ordered the small fish and chips and I had the large; although I was tempted by the all you can eat deal they had at the time. Our daughter had chicken strips off the kids menu.  What we learned was that the small fish and chips is not enough! The food leaves you wanting more. The cod was well prepared and the batter was delicious. The fries were even good!  The chicken also looked very good. I didn't try any but my wife ate a piece the next day when we were snacking on leftovers. She said it was still incredibly delicious and would love to try it fresh next time.  Service was very good as well and the restrooms were the cleanest I've seen.   We can't wait to return.,1.0,1.0
0," Homey atmosphere; very good selection of beers with European selections. Okay customer service but high turnover but terrible food hygiene. Worst yet; denial by the owner that it couldn't possibly be theirs even when you see a young gentleman in the back with long hair (in his defense he was wearing a hairnet but the hair was in the batter). Absolutely zero address to the hair that was fried in with the fish to us. They did ask if I wanted another serving as I declined with a grimace but they still had the audacity to charge me full price. After I told them \c'mon at least take off the fish; the owners disputed amongst themselves again of what to do; really loud so I can hear them as they look at me. Then the wife comes up to the register rings up a new check and leaves; again not a word; no apology. The new guy that's only been there two weeks tells me the new amount is 20% off excitedly yet NO APOLOGY! This place cannot afford to compensate fish much worse any apologies whatever happened to good ole customer service?   PS. My husband and I initially believed their denial \  it's not us we don't have long hair\   till the long hair dude came out he said he didn't have a hairnets at all at that time!   ",0.0,0.0
0,They no longer carry Guinness Draught. It has been replaced with Murphy's Irish Stout ($3/pint by the way). If ordering on the restaurant side; the cashiers are always underage; so they can never advise you on specialty beers available. Not a huge deal - but if you are stopping in for a pint; it's probably easier to sit on the bar side.   I also wish this place offered table service rather than ordering at the counter. Again; another reason to sit at the bar; I suppose.  Fish n chips still good!,0.0,0.0
0,Great Great fast Serice even if it was a bit crowded. I ordered salmon and cod small order with chips and cole slaw.  Two med sized salmon and 1 large cod  Awesome Awesome first time here I shall return.  The flavor was fresh with the deep fried crunch. Yummy if you crave fish with a crunch.  The fish did not get soggy and kept its crunch through out my meal.  Chips were super and the cole slaw was out of this world...they do something something to keep it crunchy.  Super selection of ciders.  I will need to try the rest of the menu. Well worth the trip from way up north.,1.0,1.0
0," I stopped in once for a quick bite of cheap sushi.   This is a converted fast food place of some kind in a strip shopping center. Counter service; lots of seating; and unfortunately a horrid stench. I've smelled this same distinctive odor in a Blimpy's in another city; so it makes me wonder if it's some kind of cleaning chemical that isn't being rinsed off or something. The odor gets worse when you go into the raised dining area.  The 2 stars instead of 3 is for the horrid stench.  Anyway... There were only 2 customers. The guy at the counter was nice. I ordered 2 rolls and a drink or here\   for about $10 total... cheap.  The rolls tasted ok. Better than grocery store pre-pack; but cost a little less. They were maybe the quality you'd get on a cheap asian buffet... and they were cheap.  The problem is the rolls are cut and then the pieces are layed flat in a circle smooshed together in a small plastic food-service clear containier. The result is they don't come out in whole pieces. The fall apart when you try to remove them; so you eat crumbled sushi... but they were cheap.  Would I go there again? Maybe; for takeout; and to try some other things; since the price is low. I might buy the sushi instead of picking up a pre-pack of california roll at the store if I was driving by. Maybe... if I was feeling cheap.   ",1.0,1.0

0,Ichi Bowl is a Japanese/Korean fast food Resturant that offers some delicious options to choose from.   Some of the main dishes include Teriyaki Chicken and Salmon; Orange Chicken; Spicy Beef; Vegetables and Noodles. They even proudly serve Bento (combination).  There are low carb options; salads; and Sushi. Some side dish options and Pepsi products to wash everything down.  Be sure to come during happy hour from 11:00am until 1:00pm to get a $2.75 Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. That is a daily special any business crowd would enjoy to dine at during lunch. Plus the service is super fast.   When I checked in I was offered a free medium drink with purchase. Unfortunately the man at the registered told me they no longer offer that special. He went ahead and granted it this time. Just wanted to warn you fellow YELPERS that it may not be honored.,1.0,0.0

0,I am updating my review based on our experience tonight.  We had 2 great mini pizzas with great service.  It was not as crazy busy; the music level was just right; and the front patio was open for a nice indoor/outdoor kind of vibe.  Also; we could people watch as randomness walked by.  Pizzas and drinks were very good; and being that it was not opening night; we really enjoyed the custom pizzas with less noise.  I think we will be back for the week day affordable food; quality beverages; friendly service; and outdoor seating.,1.0,1.0
0," I had the \Calexico\   pizza; it was delicious. This is wood fired pizza done right. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it's slightly confusing to order. You can get custom pizzas much the same way you would order at Subway or Chipotle. I picked the number I wanted but they still ask you if you want each ingredient on it. Simple enough; I just told them I want whatever comes with that number; I didn't see all of the toppings listed in the number available at the counter; but then I realized that the rest are \  finishers\   which are applied after cooking and are available around the other side of the counter. Not really a big deal but now I know so I can try other finishers in the future. Staff was happy and friendly. They had a very small section of beer and wine on tap but I couldn't try them on my lunch break. I will be back!   ",1.0,0.0

0," Whataburger is right there with Taco Cabana-- How does a Cali girl know of these two places; the same as why I know about White Castle; my love of food knows no limits and I used to visit relatives in AZ and TX during the summer.   So we took the kids to AZ for a Summer holiday and low and behold I see the orangey-da-glo \W\   for Whataburger a we drive by-- I get all bajiggity (nervous excited energy) in the car my hubby looks at me as if I am mad--and says NO!.. I slouch and say darn. But I plan the great escape to take the kids to experience a Whataburger OKAY?! and that I also want to relive my memories from childhood. Is that so wrong?   Lunch time. there is a line? since when? anyway- we order burgers fries; 2 pop's and a water ..... hmmm the Burger looks smaller; fries are good; they taste the same drowned in ketchup-- now I am leery of the burger its kinda sloppy looking and not meshing right; leaning if you will... but the kids waste no time and are chowing down- are they just that hungry or are the burgers that good? I am thinking In N Out might have been a safer option here..   I go for it-- I mean mentally and some of yu can relate to the whole food/memory thing a lot is riding on this first bite; years of memories and fun with my cousins spending the day swimming and then jamming all of us wired kids into a stupid little car to head out to lunch at Whataburger.   First bite; salty; a little dry but the burger in itself not bad; I think--I am loving the extra pickles.. ya Whata-good-burger.... So long story short - people are right; sometimes smells and tastes of food can trigger memories and at that first bite at that moment I was instantly teleported back to my childhood vacation just from a dang burger and fries..   Try as I might - I tried to drag the hubby back to try a Whataburger one last time with me and the kids before we left; but he was too snobby; sigh..  So why not 5 stars It has changed as far as customer service and attitude towards customers-; the gal who took my order was a bit too snarky for me attitude wise; for a teenager and She couldn't count back change; petty maybe but the checking to see if my youngest had soda in her water cup instead of water -- was a but mental for me.

0,I'm going to agree with an earlier post that that the wait time in the drive-thru can be a frustrating experience. A 10 to 20 minutes wait experienced in the last two visits is not acceptable.  I'm sure the food was made to order when I ordered it but with the wait time it was not in the fresh and made to order status by the time I received it.  This location needs to figure out a more efficient way to move people through the line such as having large orders or orders that take more than a few minutes pull off to a parking spot.  I would rate the burgers as better than average but a luke warm burger and cold fries negates all of that.,0.0,0.0
0,So as you can tell from all the other reviews; this sonic is utterly terrible! They are the worst fast food customer service in town.  Tonight we waited almost 20minutes for 2 small blasts and 1 small burger.  First; the drive-thru was empty when we parked. by the time our order finally was brought up to our car; several cars had come and gone through.   Since they took forever with no reason; My girlfriend and I asked to talk to the manager; and after waiting a few more minutes he just gave us an excuse that they were training 6 new people.....on a Saturday night????  I don't think this guy even said sorry.   So we're done with this location.  I'd rather go to ANYwhere else.  I'd rather go to the sonic on Gilbert rd (maybe 10miles away).   Avoid this sonic after 8 too; the lines get HUGE.  We showed up at 730; and it was nearly 8 by the time we left.  The parking lot was still pretty empty; and they don't care....,0.0,0.0
0,Horrible customer service. The past 3 or more times I have been there has been nothing but disappointment. Honestly it should be zero star rating. One of the times I was there; I sat and waited for my order to be taken for more than 7 minutes; when there was only one car in front of me. And while I was waiting during that time; 4; yes 4; employees walked over from the near by walgreens having a jolly good time apparently. I ended up driving off and not ordering because they would not take my order! The most recent time; I went to get a lemon berry slush. When at the window; I saw a girl put in a couple strawberries; put on the lid and shake it twice. As soon as it was handed to me I looked at it and immediately asked for it to be stirred up more because obviously from the complete white showing through the lid; it had not been mixed at all. The girl looked at me like I was crazy; closed the window; handed it to someone else; and then 3 employees proceeded to giggle and trade glances at me. They handed it back after a few seconds and big shock it looked the same. It's called a slush; not sugar water with strawberries on the side.  Again. Horrible service.  Normally sonic is one of my favorite places to go; but sadly I will not ever be returning to this location or maybe any sonic location again.  And it's not just me; every person I know that has gone there has had similar experiences.,0.0,0.0
0,We stopped by this location around 9:25 pm; for a light meal. We ordered one sandwich; an order or fries; popcorn chicken; and ice cream. We sat talking in the car for awhile; and around 9:40 we realized it had been quite a long time. No one came to talk to us or even to take our money until 10 pm. That's right; it took over half an hour for four items. When we received our food; it was cold and the fries were half full. I asked the server to at least bring us some hot food as we had been waiting almost 40 minutes. All she offered was an apology and my ice cream (with no spoon) while she ran back for hot food. I expected at least more acknowledgment of our inconvenience; something. This was the most ridiculous service I've ever had; and having worked fast food for 8 years I feel that I am very understanding about mishaps and service problems. I will never return here.,0.0,0.0
0,SIX STAR REVIEW: Everything you already love about in-n-out. Plus; one time my car broke down IN THE DRIVE THRU (facepalm; smh; embarrassing) and the employees didn't even HESITATE to come help me push it through (i mean it makes sense; they can't have a car blocking their drive-thru; that's bad for business was like 115 degrees that day and they ran out to help me!) So nice! Did you know they have a secret menu? Of course you did who cres have you seen their REGULAR MENU?? Actually i usually order a 4x4 or 5x5 cause I like to practice unhinging my jaw.

0,Like every other middle of the road In-N-Out burger joint I've ever been to--this one was full of all the same things: way too long of a wait; a simple and perfectly satisfactory burger; and some of the nicest dang kids running the place.  I was sent on an errand from someone else; which I don't mind. Sure; I'll pick you up a burger. What I didn't love; was the huge wait. I opted not to get in the drive-thru with 15+ cars ahead of me; and instead went in. I got my order in okay; but still sat there for the better part of a half hour to wait for two burgers and a shake.  Price isn't bad; but there are at least a dozen other places I'd go before In-N-Out that are more interesting. But hey brah; if it reminds you of your childhood; then go right ahead.,0.0,0.0
0,After a long afternoon out shopping; my fiancé and I decided to stop into the recently opened Jersey Mike's for a quick bite. We'd both heard rave reviews about this place from his sister in-law who frequents it out in the East valley.  We were looking forward to finally trying it out for ourselves.  The restaurant is in a neat little corner plaza surrounded by other great eateries; all of which share a really great courtyard patio with lots of community-style seating.  We entered the establishment from the courtyard; which is technically the back of the shop; and walked in to see what was in store for us.  The place was clean and brightly lit; with music blaring from the speakers.  It was definitely too loud; as we had to fight to not only hear each other; but also the people at the counter.  After we were greeted; I had to ask the counter people to repeat everything at least twice.  Not good; especially when my fiancé overheard a girl on the prep line say to another customer that she couldn't hear what they said on account of the music.  After we decided on our sandwiches; we placed our orders and moved through the line.  I ordered a hot sub; the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak (or something to that effect) and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone.  We were handed a ticket which only had my order written on it and it took us a minute to figure out they only write the hot sub orders and have you go through the assembly line for cold subs.  It took a while to get through the line; there was one girl adding toppings to the cold subs; one guy standing by waiting to wrap the finished subs in paper; and another girl running the register.  In addition; one woman was running the hot sub station on her own; the manager-type was taking cold sub orders; and another guy was mopping the floor (Really? With customers in the store?).  Something happened at the register; and I had to stand there for ten minutes waiting for my receipt.  By that time; we had my fiancé's sub but were still waiting for mine.  The woman running the hot station started calling the name Roger. When no one responded to that name; she came out onto the floor and started asking everyone personally if they were Roger.  She just kind of stood there looking confused; so I thought to ask her what kind of sub she had prepared.  Turns out; it was my sub.  The name we had given; which was also on the ticket; was Bryan.  Yeah; not even close.  By that point; we'd been in there for close to 20 minutes and were very underwhelmed by the service we'd been given.  We took our food home to (hopefully) enjoy it.  The subs weren't bad.  They weren't great; either.  I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice; but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers; a bit too much cheese; and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it.  Bryan's turkey and provolone wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread on both of our sandwiches was average - soft all around and soggy with all of the condiments.  Neither came close to being as great as Jimmy John's; and for what I paid; I would go to Subway over Jersey Mike's.  I really hope this place makes some improvements to their customer service; and at the very least; they should turn down the music a few notches - that might help with the communication issues.,0.0,1.0

We entered the establishment from the courtyard; which is technically the back of the shop; and walked in to see what was in store for us.  The place was clean and brightly lit; with music blaring from the speakers.  It was definitely too loud; as we had to fight to not only hear each other; but also the people at the counter.  After we were greeted; I had to ask the counter people to repeat everything at least twice.  Not good; especially when my fiancé overheard a girl on the prep line say to another customer that she couldn't hear what they said on account of the music.  After we decided on our sandwiches; we placed our orders and moved through the line.  I ordered a hot sub; the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak (or something to that effect) and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone.  We were handed a ticket which only had my order written on it and it took us a minute to figure out they only write the hot sub orders and have you go through the assembly line for cold subs.  It took a while to get through the line; there was one girl adding toppings to the cold subs; one guy standing by waiting to wrap the finished subs in paper; and another girl running the register.  In addition; one woman was running the hot sub station on her own; the manager-type was taking cold sub orders; and another guy was mopping the floor (Really? With customers in the store?).  Something happened at the register; and I had to stand there for ten minutes waiting for my receipt.  By that time; we had my fiancé's sub but were still waiting for mine.  The woman running the hot station started calling the name Roger. When no one responded to that name; she came out onto the floor and started asking everyone personally if they were Roger.  She just kind of stood there looking confused; so I thought to ask her what kind of sub she had prepared.  Turns out; it was my sub.  The name we had given; which was also on the ticket; was Bryan.  Yeah; not even close.  By that point; we'd been in there for close to 20 minutes and were very underwhelmed by the service we'd been given.  We took our food home to (hopefully) enjoy it.  The subs weren't bad.  They weren't great; either.  I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice; but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers; a bit too much cheese; and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it.  Bryan's turkey and provolone wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread on both of our sandwiches was average - soft all around and soggy with all of the condiments.  Neither came close to being as great as Jimmy John's; and for what I paid; I would go to Subway over Jersey Mike's.  I really hope this place makes some improvements to their customer service; and at the very least; they should turn down the music a few notches - that might help with the communication issues.,0.0,1.0
0,Love this place. Nice employees; fast service. I love the sense of urgency in a fast food restaurant. The sandwiches are filling and delicious. Their salads are also hefty; that makes me happy because sometimes salads are small because the company thinks you don't want to eat a lot because youre ordering a salad; not here.,1.0,1.0
0,Now these guys make a mean sub. Quality is top notch. Service is quick and place is well layer out. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the parking situation is the worst. The lot is for a bunch of businesses but is way to small. Trying to get in or out is like a scenario out of a mad max movie.,1.0,1.0
0,What can I say? I am really impressed by their business; last week we got two regular subs; when we got home we noticed that it seemed to be lacking in meat and the cheese was non-existent on one and paper thin on the other. The subs were still good; but it was disappointing and I sent my concern off to Jersey Mike's. Within a couple of hours the manager of the location I had this experience called me.  She offered to treat my family to a sub dinner for our trouble. That is obvious commitment to quality service. The subs were fantastic this time. Turns out they were actually having issues with the slicer the day I went.   They will get my business again; their subs are tasty; with quality ingredients; and they are committed to customer service. Yes their prices are a bit higher then a place like subway; but you do get what you pay for!,1.0,1.0
0,Huge fan of Jersey Mikes. This location opened a few months ago and is always booming! The bread is fresh; the meat and cheese it cut to order and the vegetables are crisp and perfect. The service has been great every time I've been. I always order my sammy Mike's way: lettuce; tomato; onion; oil; vinegar and seasoning. Just a killer sandwich shop....I'm a believer!,1.0,1.0

0,All I have been hearing is how great this place is; best chicken fingers in town. Well after hearing all of the hype; Wife and I decided to try this franchise out.  NO BIG DEAL!! Chicken was OK; not much flavor. Thinking they are counting on you trying their Cane Sauce for the flavor? Speaking of sauce; they have ketchup; honey mustard; and cane sauce. Now their Cane Sauce is like a thousand island with a little kick. They do not offer is mustard; and BBQ Sauce? Nothing here really stood out for me; it really wasn't that big of a deal. I would rather go to Chick-fil-a anytime! I do need to mentioned that their service was really good; the gals were very courteous; always making sure everything was fine! Overall; I am glad we at least tried it; not saying I wouldn't come here again. But there is better chicken out there.,1.0,0.0
0,Great service every time I come here!  Not a lot on the menu but that makes it easy to decide.  The chicken; special sauce; and Texas toast are amazing!  Not the greatest fries but everything else makes up for it.  Hoping one day they put one in North West Peoria!,1.0,1.0

0,My all time favorite Phoenix fast food restaurant. I have been coming here for almost 3 years and they have consistently good food; and excellent customer service. Christy; the gal at the drive through window; is the nicest; most friendly person I have encountered at a restaurant here in Phoenix.   I usually order the ginger chicken bowl with no rice and extra veggies. All the veggies are fresh; never frozen (you can see the whole carrots and fresh broccoli and cabbage from the window); and they are steamed to crunchy perfection. The ginger sauce is great; the portions are HUGE; and the prices are terrific. The crab puffs are full of crab (I find it strange at other restaurants crab puffs are on the menu; but don't actually have any crab in them); and are an excellent price at 6/$2.50. The spicy chicken wings and chicken satay are also delicious.  Luu's Chicken bowl has great food; great prices; and the best customer service in Phoenix!,1.0,1.0

0," I've eaten here twice; and though others have raved about this place; I don't see it as anything outstanding.  The service is definitely great - they are family owned and super friendly.  The food is fresh and the crab puffs definitely are tasty.  The first time we came; I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl - it came with some veggies and rice.  Though it was hot and fresh; the taste wasn't amazing - but it was good. The 2nd time I ordered the BBQ pork - I thought it'd be more like \char siu\   but it wasn't - it was just drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  The meat was plentiful of course.  I will keep coming here since our house is nearby when I have those bowl cravings.   ",1.0,1.0
0,Great authentic Japanese fast food at great prices. Fast friendly service. I got the chicken teriyaki and yakisoba. It was very tasty at a great price and they give a good portion. I would definitely recommend going here if you want authentic cheap Japanese food.,1.0,1.0
0,I came here after finding it on yelp. Their food is very fresh; with the chicken carefully laid across the vegetables and rice with sauce on top. The presentation is really lovely for a fast food-ish place. In addition; the staff was super friendly. I told them it was my first time dining there; and they advised me to order the ginger chicken bowl; which I loved. I also ordered the crab puffs; after seeing so many positive reviews. The crab puffs were not all cream cheese like at other places; they were filled with crab and had some green onions; too. Be careful if you order these- they make them fresh for each order and they are HOT when they first come out! I dipped them in both the sweet and sour and the hot sauce that can be found at the sauce bar.  I wish I had gotten brown rice; but now I know for next time. I recommend this place if you are looking for a quick; cheap; asian fix in the area.,1.0,1.0
0,What a great discovery!  Luu's Chicken Bowl is a current favorite for our family.  We had driven by the location several times without even noticing it was there; but I could not be more happy we stumbled across it.   For those of you who don't like to read a page long review; here are some of the things I love most about Luu's....  Homemade; amazingly delicious sauces Fresh; high quality ingredients Fast; friendly service Great prices and generous servings They have a drive through  These guys know how to pack a to-go sack! ...and last but not least.......the CRAB WONTONS!  Oh; you want to know more?  Well; let me elaborate a bit :)  Upon entering Luu's; I always know I will be greeted by a smiling friendly face and an immaculately clean dining area.  There is a white board near the register listing the daily specials (try the teriyaki chicken and yakisoba) and a small counter housing homemade condiments; plastic utensils and a soda fountain.  After I place my order; I always hear a fresh batch of wontons get dropped in the fryer as they prepare our chicken bowls.  After just a few minutes; my order is on the counter perfectly parceled with everything I could need; extra teriyaki sauce; hot sauce; sweet and sour; and if we get a ginger chicken bowl (another must try item) there is also extra ginger sauce.  There are napkins and utensils included in the bag; as well.  If you decide to go through the drive through; keep in mind that they fry the wontons and egg rolls to order so there will be a few minutes of waiting at the window if you order these items.  The crab wontons are the crabbiest I have had.  Ever. They are delish with a double dip into the sweet and sour and then the hot sauce.  Trust me; it will be the best $2.59 +tax you have spent in a long time   **For a nominal fee you can substitute white meat chicken and/or brown rice; both of which I highly recommend,1.0,1.0
0,Great food! The price is right for a chicken bowl; just under $5 and for just under $6; you can get a combo with pork; chicken or beef. I recently ordered food for 6 people and it could have fed 8-10. Oh; and the crab puffs?? Really; really good and only $2.50 for a bag of 6. I would recommend this for take-out. The inside of the restaurant is kind of what you'd expect (tacky and hole-in-the-wallish).,0.0,0.0
0,A nice inexpensive neighborhood place for a rice bowl.  We tried the ginger chicken and teriyaki chicken bowls - both were quite good and the sauce was provided generously.  We also ordered the crab puffs which were also tastey. Don't be turned away by the appearance of the building; we were happy we gave it a try.,0.0,0.0

0," Merriam-Webster defines \Café\   as follows... \  A usually small and informal establishment serving various refreshments (as coffee).\    Can you get coffee here?  No.  Well; to be honest; I have never asked for coffee; but who would at a Chinese... I mean...Asian restaurant.  So this so called \  Café\   has no coffee.  Is that a problem?  No.  First of all; they do have 2/3 of the definition correct.  It is small; and informal.  For me; that is close enough.  I do have to say; though; that for an order-at-the-counter \  Asian\   restaurant; it is extremely clean and new inside.  And the staff is extremely friendly.  In fact; you can ask them about their food and they actually have an answer!  Now friends; this is extremely peculiar for such a restaurant.  This friendliness also lends itself to some flexibility when it comes to ordering.  They will let you substitute meats; adjust heat of a dish; etc.; without blinking and eye.  And all this for dirt farm poor prices.  The lunch specials are an insane bargain with all kinds of sides.  And for dinner; although it is a bit more expensive; they load you up with tons of food.     But this begs the question you are all wondering.  Is this \  Café\   at least \  Asian?\    Merriam-Webster defines \  Asian\   as follows...\  Of; relating to; or characteristic of the continent of Asia or its people.\    So do they have Russian food here?  No.  Do they have Vegemite here?  No.  Do they even have Korean food or Japanese food?  No.  This is truly Chinese food; without question.  And it is an outstanding example of Chinese cuisine.  Everything is made to order; extremely fresh; and very light and authentic; sort of the anti-Panda Express.  And considering this place will make your food just about as quickly; without having to wait in line with a bunch of mouth-breathing yahoos; I would highly recommend a visit to Asian Café; even if the name is completely and utterly misleading.  And besides; the name still makes a lot more sense than Panda Express.  I mean; can you eat Panda there?  Do they have Pandas working in the kitchen?  Do they have a Panda petting zoo in there somewhere?  Would you want that where you eat anyway?  I hear those things are dirty; ornery; and smelly.   ",1.0,0.0
0,We flew into Phoenix and decided to eat lunch before we headed to Sedona. We were craving Asian food and decided to give Asian Cafe a try. We ordered; Mongolian beef; spicy Thai chicken; sesame chicken; and sweet and sour chicken. Each entree was accompanied by a scoop of fried rice; a scoop of noodles; an egg roll; a fortune cookie; and a soda. The egg roll was pretty standard fare; but had a nice ginger taste that was unique. The fried rice was quite bland. I am not an Asian noodle fan; so I did not try them. The chicken entrees were all good. All in all; the food was fine. It was very inexpensive ... $4.50 for the whole meal. I was not impressed; however;  with the styrofoam food boxes (dine-in meals  served that way); styrofoam cups and plastic forks and knives. I do not think I would return to or recommend the restaurant as there are many others to choose from in the area .,0.0,0.0
0,The service at this restaurant is terrible.  They throw food at you like they are giving food to the homeless. :(   I called the manager to complain; and she said she will fix the problem.   The food are so expensive here.  The burrito is full of rice and very little of everything else.   Do you ever question what you put in your stomach for your meal??? They claim that they try to get organic food here; but I don't really know or we all don't know how hard they try (1% or 99% organic????).

0,Very Impressed! I was helping my daugher move and this is right by her new place so we ran in for a sandwhich. We got the italian sub with chips and a drink. The italian sub was fantastic. So flavorful and just the right amount of stuff on it; including a very flavorful italian sauce. The sandwhich was perfectly toasted and good sized. The drink fountain was fun! It actually was fun! You can pick the type of soda/tea; etc and add flavoring. I had a raspberry lemonade and then when I was leaving I filled it up with cherry coke. Ok; I felt like a little kid playing with the machine! The service was fast and friendly. The food excellent and the location perfect for my daughter's new place.

0,After phenomenal In-N-Out experiences in Cali and subpar ones in Texas; I was initially nervous about the In-N-Out in AZ; more specifically Peoria. It is a slight notch below Cali; but certainly miles ahead of Dallas. Plus; I've learned that no matter what; animal style makes everything better. Yes; everything.  A double-double with french fries drenched in the animal style goo is always my go to and if I'm feeling extra saucy; I'll throw in a shake on top of it. I got all of the above here and while the burger was up to par; the fries and the shake were definitely under par. Dry potatoes and a hard shake made for tough consumption; but 1st world problems for spending less than $6 for a fattening meal would lead me to complain less and not more.  Service was pretty standard. Efficient; almost military precision in assembling my tray of heart attack worthy fast food. Impressive; considering how often they must deal with lines and rude tourists who know nothing about In-N-Out. What I still wouldn't give to have one of these in NYC ...,1.0,0.0

0,Out of around 15 In-N-Out's I've been; this one has the best food and service.  In-N-Out consistently provides top service; prices; and food quality in the burger and fries fast food chain market.  In-N-Out seriously needs to review their parking/drive through development.  Half the locations I've been to have some kind of issue.  This In-N-Out is RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ENTER/EXIT.  Once you're in the parking lot/drive though area it's ok.  If you're leaving In-N-Out; and planning to head west on Bell (or to the 101); it's almost impossible without a u-turn or separate lot turnaround in high volume traffic.

I think it's the best fast food burger chain and is miles ahead of Five Guys and Shake Shack; etc.   This location is kind of situated in a weird place. It's not actually in the target shopping center; even though it's at the corner of it. You have to enter separately through the entrance closest to the store. Weird; I know.

0," This isn't so much an In n Out review; which I will touch on; but more of an update to a previous Simonmed review (based on an MRI I required). I don't know what MRI stands for but I'm sure it's not something positive or cheerful like Monkey Reads Incyclopedia....Ok Ok...I know it's not spelled correctly...I mean; who really knows how to spell monkey. What I'm saying is that I had GREAT results from my MRI (which I've reviewed along with Dr. Fry who delivered the relieving and wonderful news) and the first 
aughty\   reward I thought of was an In N Out burger. I discovered and devoured them in LA for 16 years and in Phoenix they are more difficult to find. Thank you intersection of FLW and Scottsdale Blvd (further know as ScottsBull). After leaving Dr. Fry's Airpark Medical Center in NoScott with good news I needed something toxic....nicotine; alchohol; perhaps something illegal or; oh; red meat....that's still legal; I think. Burger was amazing. Bun was soft and crisp and buttery where needed; lettuce; tomato an onion were crispier than a November wind blowing off Lake Michigan (pre greenhouse effect) and the accompanying soda hit the spot. Truly; with that 1;000 island sauce action; this was my fast food heaven. And; I forgot how much I LOVE Amercian cheese. Fast food service was impeccible. Clean grounds.

It was surreal being the only customers in an In N Out Burger considering they are usually packed. The employees were friendly and hardworking. There was none of the horseplay that I could expect in a fast food restaurant when only a couple of customers are inside.    I ordered the standard cheeseburger meal. With a selection of three meals; the choice was an easy one. Because they make the burger upon order; it took a few minutes from order to eating. No complaints.     In my opinion; the cheeseburger was good but not the best. The fries were decent.    When it comes to fast food; in many instances the ratings of their food is one person's opinion. This person's opinion is that In N Out is 3 stars.,1.0,0.0
0,What can I say that hasn't already been said about In-N-Out Burger? Probably nothing.  I ate here knowing it was going to be my last gluten and dairy inclusive meal for a very long time; so I totally splurged; ordering a burger animal style (minus the cheese); fries; and a strawberry milkshake.  The burger was awesome.  You can get it protein style; wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun; and that's probably what I'll get the next time I'm in town.  The fried onions and the special sauce; as well as the obvious freshness of all the ingredients; proved In-N-Out to be worth the hype and well above Five Guys.  The strawberry milkshake was grand.  The fries were eh.  I'm told they are usually made to order; but I am pretty sure I didn't get a fresh batch.  They were good in that they weren't too salty; but they could have been hotter and crisper; for sure.    In short; animal style; animal style; animal style.  I see now why people are obsessed with this place.  I can't think of a better hangover cure.,0.0,0.0
0,Great as always.  We were in Scottsdale for a long weekend and this was our best meal!    In-n-out loses one star for me because their fries are not crispy; even if we order them well done.  Other than that; fantastic.,0.0,1.0

0," RECOMMENDED: My car got sucked into the drive thru by the intergalactic tractor beam so I had to appease it by ordering a Double-Double and some well done fries!  In-N-Out is part of what makes the West Coast the West Coast. I love that they make their burgers fresh to order and only use fresh meat. The fries took a little to adjust to; since I had grown accustomed to the crap other burger joints put in their fries. Not In-N-Out... You can see them cutting up whole potatoes to make their fries.   In-N-Out is known for their \secret\   menu. My advise is to ask someone in the know or simply read the comments on the listing here in Yelp for some hints and insight.   My personal favorites are the Double Double or the Triple Triple. Simply put... That's 2 patties with 2 slices of cheese or 3 patties with 3 slices of cheese!  I order mine Animal style!  Ask for this and you'll certainly never order it off the menu again.   The North Scottsdale location is easy to get to. It's always clean and the staff is impressive!  It's hard to beat In-N-Out in the fast food burger niche. Enjoy ;-)   ",1.0,0.0
0,Paid a visit to this In-n-Out when I had a craving for a burger. Don't ask why. I was REAAAALLY hungry. Yikes.   So; for my one horrible unhealthy meal for the week; I chose this.  Cheeseburger. Animal Style. Toast. Fries. Diet Coke (Since I'm watching my figure). It was effing delicious.   I did the drive through thing. I waited the customary five minutes; but everything came out FRESH to order; especially the fries. No salt on the fries; which is how I like it. I can salt them as I see fit.   Also; everything was packaged just the way I like it.  In-N-Out....you are what a hamburger is all about.,0.0,0.0
0,Must say my favorite hamburger joint! Too bad I have not seen one of these franchises on the East Coast! Very friendly staff! Easy to read menu! Price cannot be beat for the Food I had ordered! I timed that food was delivered exactly in 10 mins,1.0,1.0
0,Simplicity is the key to enjoying this place.  Take a look at the menu.  There's only 5 things you can order.... hamburgers; cheeseburgers; fries; soda and shakes.  That's it.  Nothing much to think about here.      Unlike other fast food joints; they have no chicken; no patty melts; no tacos; no nuggets; no chili; no kids meals; no breakfast; no onion rings; no egg sandwiches; no cookies; no bacon; no curly fries; no coffee; no orange juice; no sliders; no rib sandwiches; no pork products; no ice cream cones; no parfaits; no burritos; no salads; no dollar menu; no value menu and no cherry turnovers.  I think this burger is a winner.  I love a good cheeseburger; but when I go to In and Out I order my double burger with no cheese.  It tastes so good it doesn't need the cheese.  But I do recommend the grilled onions.  That is the way to go... grilled onions.  Does Burger King offer grilled onions?  I seriously doubt it.  Would you want to eat grilled onions from Burger King?  Think about your response carefully before answering.  The fries are sliced right there from a real potato.  A REAL POTATO.  Like the brown thing that you see at the grocery store.  When I see a McDonalds or Jack in the Box truck driving around town I imagine inside that truck is a lot of frozen food.  I gotta figure that the fries are frozen in a bag.  But at In and Out Burger; I can see the guy slicing up the REAL POTATOES.,0.0,0.0
0,I travel to Scottsdale once or twice a year; and whenever I'm there; a burger (or two) at In-N-Out is a MUST!  In the car ride over I can honestly feel the butterflies in my stomach. A nervous-excitedness comes over me like I'm seeing my boyfriend for the first time after a long vacation or something. Will the burger still have the same greasy burger perfected deliciousness with just the right amount of sauce; lettuce; tomato; cheese and buttery toasted bun? Yes and yes.  (insert When Harry Met Sally scene...you know the one)  Shame on me for being an out-of-towner though; as I have just discovered their 'secret menu'! Animal style; protein style - don't know what that means? Just order it anyways because it's going to be amazing! OH and they have 7-UP as a fountain soda choice! Where else is that possible?!  In-N-Out always manages to knock my socks off. Everything is fresh; and the service surpasses that of fast food.  They have perfected the classic burger and fries combo.   So...when's the next flight out?,1.0,1.0
0,I love Culver's.  Their burgers are among my favorite; the cheese curds are delicious; and their peanut butter Concrete Mixer is sinful.  Unfortunately; service at this location is exceptionally lacking.  I placed a drive-thru order for the food items mentioned above last week during the lunch hour.  I was asked to pull forward to wait for my meal; and I waited... and waited... and waited.  I waited for a full 20 minutes before my meal was brought out to me; only to find it was incorrect.  The server who brought the food out to me stared at me like he didn't know what I was saying and then told me I was mistaken.  When he saw I was; indeed; correct; he took my food bank in and I waited another five minutes for my meal.  At that point; already late getting back to work; I left.  Imagine my dismay when I got back to my desk and discovered my meal was wrong yet again.  It was my fault for not checking once again before leaving; I know; but seriously?  I'll stick with the Metrocenter location despite it being a few miles out of my way.,0.0,0.0
0,Ugh; these places are terrible.  I'm not really sure why the husband and I decided to give them another shot; maybe because they're in a nicer part of town or maybe we were just being nice; who knows.    We decided to go inside the restaurant this time to see what they were all about and it's just a little overwhelming and quite a bit claustrophobic.  There is so much going on in here; with a huge backlit menu above the registers; a good number of TV's blasting some basketball game; and the cacophony going on in the kitchen.  After about 10 minutes of trying to figure the menu out; we decide to order and then wait about another 10 minutes while the guy pushing the buttons figured out how to do a stupid cheeseburger with just mayo and ketchup.  We waited a little while for our food to come out and the same look of disappointment from my last experience spread across my face when I saw my burger.  I got an ill formed patty with ridiculously cripsy edges and haphazard construction.  I ate it and it really sucked.  At least I didn't get sick this time.  The only good things about this place are their fried cheese curds and some promising concrete flavors.  Aside from those two things; I will never eat anything else from here again.,0.0,0.0
0," Decided to try this custard out. LIttle did I know it was the wrong day OR their service is just this bad. I NEVER GOT MY ORDER! Ordered a shake and waited and waited and waited. People with shake orders came and went. Hanging near the counter; the employee asked \are you still waiting?\  . Finally gave up and left. They took my money but never got my food.   ",0.0,0.0
0,My first experience with Culver's was absolutely fantastic.  The food was very tasty and the atmosphere was friendly.  The girl (sad to say I forgot her name) demonstrated one of the best customer service experiences I had every had.  I wished I was fortunate to have hired her.  Culver's keep up the great work and give the Culver's Crew a raise for a job well done.,1.0,1.0
0,I have family members who love this place!  We met up today and I can see why.  I don't eat fast food as a rule but ended up having a grilled cheese; side salad; and strawberry shake. My family had fried chicken and burgers; along with frozen custatds.  This place is definitely a few steps above Mickey D's; etc.  The service is good; as are the prices.  I do appreciate the pricing and opportunity to order a children's meal.  For my fast-food loving friends; it's a thumbs up.,1.0,1.0
0,If they had a Culver's on every street corner; the cardiologists would all have twice as much money. I went there for my first time today for lunch; and I was hoping for a good; non-processed burger. I got my wish; a soft bun; red onions; lettuce; fresh tomatoes... all the fixings were great. The cheese was very good; and the beef patties were also good. (I got the deluxe). Since I never had fried cheese curds; I got those as my side item.  It was very reasonably priced; $8 or so for the combo with a root beer. Service was fast; food was fresh and hot. But here's the kicker.... I looked up the nutrional information after lunch; when I felt like I couldn't get out of my office chair. This combo had 84g of fat and 3000mg of sodium.  Even if you don't watch what you eat; these numbers should scare the hell out of you. To put it into perspective; my diet calls for 1500mg sodium DAILY.  I could've gone to In-N-Out; gotten an animal style double-double with fries and saved 15 grams of fat and saved 1300mg sodium. I could've ordered 2 quarter pounders with cheese and 2 large fries and still eaten fewer grams of fat and sodium. Now do you see exactly how bad these burgers are for you?!? Imagine if I had gotten the bacon cheeseburger with a custard for dessert. That'd be another 30 grams of fat. We're talking triple digits here. Scary stuff. Now; I like to splurge on occasion for great food. Unfortunately; for that caloric catastrophe; it simply wasn't worth it. It's a good burger; definitely better than the typical fast food; but come on. These numbers are beyond reasonable.  To be fair; the fried cheese curds constituted 38g of fat alone. Now that I've had them for the first time in my life; I'll say I enjoyed them. They're almost as good as fried mozzarella; but I still prefer the Italian version over the Wisconsin one. So if you want to splurge; enjoy the custard. I've had it once before here; and it's excellent; especially the vanilla. But if you want to blow your diet; even though the food is decent here; do it somewhere else.,1.0,1.0
0," Let me start by saying I love Chipotle. With that being said I was let down today. There were lots of staff who were 10 times louder than all the customers. You could hear every personal conversation they were having including ones about other staff with uggers\   on them and many colorful curse words (with kids in the restaurant). The manager was included with the staff and seemed ok or oblivious to the conversations of the staff. The food was ok but the service was horrible.   Staff was noisy; crude and gave the feeling you were a bother by being here. All I thought about my entire meal was is where the buggers are were or will be. I finally gave up threw my food away and left.   ",0.0,0.0
0,Not much needs to be said about Chipotle's food in general... if you've never been to one; I suggest going immediately; like; right now; or you might as well jump off a cliff because life is just not worth living (jk; don't really do that).  Chipotle's food is delish; consistent; healthy; fast; fresh; environmentally conscious; and well priced.  What more can you ask for?  If this will be your first Chipotle experience; get a chicken burrito (currently $6.25); with a side of chips and guac ($2.95)... you can't go wrong!  Regarding this specific Queen Creek location; I am a frequent.  95% of the time; I submit my order via the Chipotle app in the Apple Appstore.  Very easy and fun to order this way.  I almost always get the chicken (occasionally the carnitas); because I've found that the other meats (steak; shredded beef) are just not that great... the steak is a bit chewy for my taste.  Anyway; the orders are usually complete within 5 minutes of the pickup time confirmation; but it is not unusual for me to show up a few minutes after the pickup time and they haven't even started it yet.  They are usually very kind and accommodating about it; and may even offer free drinks or chips for the inconvenience... and once; they even paid for the meal followed up by one of the employees calling my phone to apologize and ask about the problem.  They do seem to have a pretty decently high turnover of the staff.  Not sure what to make of that; but it does cause some hiccups in the service (including running out of guacamole once; which was very depressing... because it's sooo good; and I can barely live without it) as they are training the new employees.  But in all the turnover; I have only come in contact with one employee who should not have been working there; and he doesn't anymore; thankfully.  All in all; even though this is not the best Chipotle location; it has top quality Chipotle food; friendly employees; and a pleasant atmosphere.,0.0,0.0
0,This place sits right across the street from where I work and; at most; it's a five minute walk. While the place is usually busy during my lunch hour; that's to its credit because people want to eat there and they're willing to wait. I'm always willing to wait; but folks; they have an iPod/iPhone app and an order online feature that makes it so you don't have to wait. I frequently order my lunch hours before lunchtime. When I get there; it's in a sack with my name on it and I get to skip the line; pay; and eat.  Brilliant!  Also the staff here is easily the friendliest I've ever seen in a Chipotle. They know my name; even though I only go there once or twice a month; usually on a payday. I usually order my burrito with extra sour cream and they always happily oblige. The service is superb.  The place is kept very clean. Indeed; I've seen people come out from behind the counter to clean; wipe; and tidy when they have a brief lull.  In the end; I think it says something about the place when I will drive out of my way to go to this particular Chipotle than drive a shorter distance to a closer one.,1.0,1.0
0,Great food; but my order gets messed almost every time up. Today; Arizona burrito was missing and 2 sides of guacamole MIA.... Last visit my French fries were MIA......

0," Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which; unfortunately; they sometimes skimp on; in my opinion.   I have to tell you; though; I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week; but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole \kids eat free\   thing.) I was so mesmerized; as I waited in line to order and then for my food;  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And; their kids' meals have educational toys; often promoting literacy).   ",0.0,1.0
0,Ok; yes I am writing a review for a fast food restaurant. I realize that seems a bit strange and quite possibly extremely unnecessary. I mean; fast food is fast food right? Everyone knows what their getting into and what kind of food to expect; right? While this is true I felt it was worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing Chick-Fil-A.  It's nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken. The nuggets are yummy; flavorful but not overbreaded. My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy. We also enjoyed the sweet tea which is a classic Chick-fil-A staple.  One important thing to note was that this location was super busy when we walked in right at noon but soon after we ordered our food was ready in a flash. And for those of you who have never been to CFA before? The icing on the cake is the wonderful assortment of dipping sauces to suit whatever flavor mood you are in at the moment. Or you can do what I do and open one of each and dip to your hearts desire. Who doesn't love variety?!,0.0,1.0
0,The only reason I give this chickfila on Tatum 2 stars is because chickfila's food is so good. BUT this chickfila is so poorly run! If you go through the drive thru expect to wait at least 10 min. Do not go when you are in a hurry. It is so slow. Also they rarely get your order correct and you MUST check your order; including your drink; before pulling away. This chickfila needs some help with speed and accuracy; it is not run like all the other chickfila's that I have visited through the years,0.0,0.0
0,So; in order to counter the bad review of KFC I did - I'd like to thank Popeye's for being right down the street from the office. The staff here is ALWAYS good; even the drive thru. And it's always quick; unlike the toher chicken place up the street.  My standard order?   Number 5 = 5 Piece strips (spicy) with biscuit and Red Beans & Rice. Root Beer to drink.  The only thing that could make it better would be Vernors in the soda machine...,1.0,1.0
0,This is one of the better Popeyes restaurants in this part of town. It is a full service location and not part of a stinky gas station or quickie store. The inside is decorated with jars of chili peppers and other fun ingredients and there is a bigger seating area than some of the others stores.   Usually stop in here when I'm in the area picking up some industrial parts for the shop. It is close to several vendors and a quick and easy meal when my stomach is growling for some Cajun yummies.  Normally order something off the Spicy side of the menu and get several Jalapenos to wash things down. The dark meat is a treat and I like to get a bunch of thighs and avoid the less juicy white meat. Must say that the Red Beans and Rice are also a favorite and like to save them for dessert.  Service is always super friendly and you will see some of the same people working here over the years. The orders come out pretty quick and the food is consistently very tasty.  Watch out for the bus load of school kids that walk over during their lunch break. The place can get really busy and the wait times can take longer than usual. Whatever happened to the lame brown bag lunches that we were forced to eat back in the days?   See ya there next time and remember Tuesday they have their 2pc chicken special for super cheap.

0," Allow me to preface by saying that I'm rating this as a fast-food chicken joint.  Comparables are places like KFC and Louisiana Fried Chicken and Churches (etc).  I'm not comparing to Pappadeaux's or anyplace like that.  We were coming from a work out.  Didn't eat much before (hard to work out on a full stomach...sometimes get to feeling really sick when we do that).  So we were HUNGRY!  A craving for chicken was in the air; and especially Louisiana Fried Chicken.  But there was a notice on their door that the landlord had locked them out.  Consulting YELP we spotted \Popeye's\  .  So off we go!  The place didn't look special at all.  Routine fast-food look with a drive-thru.  Menu was similar to other fast food chicken places; except the \  Cajun rice\  ; \  Cajun fries\  ; \  red beans and rice\  ; and \  Jambalaya\  .  You can get the chicken \  regular\   or \  Cajun\  .  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I went with a deal they had painted on their window; and then ordered some extras (Jambalaya and two sides).  Then realized maybe there was a deal that would include that and cost less.  The guy looked at the total; checked his board quickly; and said that was the best way to get what I wanted.  The food took about as long as expected for a fast food chicken joint.  The fries were like most seasoned fries I've had.  Maybe a little more kick; but not much more.  They were very good; but didn't jump up and say \  Cajun\   to me.  The Cajun rice was similar to a dirty rice (Cajun); and was good.  Not spicy (hot); but very tasty.  The Jambalaya was also good.  Again; not spicy.  Not comparable to Pappadeaux's.  But good.  We ordered half/half for the chicken so we could try the regular and the spicy.  The regular was like KFC used to be long ago (when KFC was \  Kentucky Fried Chicken\  ; and was good).  It was your basic good fried chicken.  The spicy was a bit inconsistent.  Some pieces were \  I feel the burn\   while others were more mild.  I preferred the spicy anyway.  Good fried chicken with a bit more flavor.  Frankly; I prefer the food at Louisiana Fried Chicken; but that doesn't do much good since they are evidently out of business (unless they can pay-off the landlord and get un-locked-out).  Popeye's was very good for what it is.  I foresee Popeye's being our new Cajun chicken joint for now.  If LFC comes back I may have to re-evaluate.  But we were very happy with the food we got here.  In fact; we even had the leftovers for lunch today!  :-)   ",1.0,0.0

0,Never have I ever been so disappointed at a Qdoba. I live right behind this location and I've come many times before. It's never been the fastest and I've never seen more than two people in the front; but today is just ridiculous. It's never been that busy that I've had to wait that long for my food anyways; and I've never been in a hurry so I never minded that it's not the fastest. I am standing in line and I haven't even ordered my food yet; which I only came for chips and Queso - As soon as I walked in I was surprised to see the line so long it curved around; 14 people in line - one person at the front making the food and ringing up the order. What the hell? It's noon; why do you only have one person at the front counter? There is a gentleman coming back and forth to put the steak and chicken on the grill; but that's it. Three people have left in the time I've taken to write this review.

0," Great concept for the \on the go; no time to cook\  ; person like me.I have always liked the convenience of fast food and now there is a healthy; delicious option with Salad and Go. I live in Central Phoenix and make it a point that anytime I'm in the Gilbert/Chandler area to stop by and grab lunch; or a salad to save for dinner. My three favorites: Spinach and Smoked Bacon; The Santa Fe; and The Asian. The portions are great for the price; huge bowls of mixed greens; tossed in handcrafted dressings; with fresh; delicious proteins available; my favorite salad topper- the grilled flank steak; Yum! Although the drive thru line is long; give it a shot; its worth it. And if you don't want to wait in the drive thru than park; and walk up to the window. Be patient; this food isn't sitting premade and ready to go; it's fresh and made to order. Good things come to those who wait; I can't wait for the restaurant to expand.

0," It's really the one secret that Doctors Hate.  This is pretty much the only ast-food\   that I will eat.  Or in a pinch;  I'll go to Subway; because I personally think yoga mats are delicious with a little mustard and pickle.  What can I say about Salad and Go that hasn't already been said about the wheel; sliced bread; or purses with designer labels printed in patterns all over them?   I could pretty much eat here exclusively.  If I were still a student I probably would.  The service is always fast and friendly.  Even if I go during peak lunch or dinner hour there is a never a long wait.  When I see more than 4 cars in the drive-through I use the walk-up window.   I enjoy the seasonal offerings; but I always end up going back to my favorite \  The Greek\  .  The salads are BIG; and they'll keep well if you ask for the dressing on the side.  It's obvious that they are made fresh.  There are always a pile of staff chopping away in that tiny kitchen.  I absolutely LOVE the place!  The only thing I would suggest would be to add more high quality protein options; maybe partner with a local sustainable supplier.  I currently add my own protein at home because I haven't found the addition offered to be satisfying.   But again - the place is great.  I wish they'd open up on every corner.

Anyway; I knew they were a new business and figured I'd have to go back and give them another chance. I am SO very glad I did.  I ordered the same Chicken Caesar Salad but this time I got the dressing on the side.  What a difference; it was delicious!  I will be a forever customer now with my dressing on the side.  I am always on the go; always eating fast food so it's great to have a healthy alternative.,0.0,0.0
0,Imagine the scene: driving through the inky dark of night; nearing the end of a cross country-road trip; and sadly assuming that you've seen the last WhataBurger you'll see for years when you left Texas. Then; miraculously; that bright Orange and White striped roof materializes through your windshield in front of you. Your girlfriend (at the time) and you let out twin war whoops; you pull over and order a Jalapeno Burger and fries even though it's nearing midnight and you've already eaten a real dinner just a few hours before. You even order an extra burger for your roommate waiting back home in LA; knowing he will probably not be interested in a cold burger that's been sitting in a car for four hours. But you wrap it up and take it home with you anyway; because you're a good friend.   This WhataBurger in Arizona was the last one I'd ever visited; and I may be overly sentimental about it. But I dream of those Orange and White Stripes; dream of returning there one day; dream of the spicy bite of the Jalapeno Burger. I dream of the infinite.,0.0,0.0
0,I am ashamed to be reviewing a fast-food joint but I love me some Whataburger. Specifically the #8 with a Coke. Two chicken fingers; small fries; Texas toast and white gravy. It is the only thing I ever eat here with the exception of their soft-baked chocolate cookies. Does that not sound like the dream meal to you? Well; it is to me! Yeah; it stinks waiting in line but I can't complain that they make your food fresh to order. Seriously though; W; do we need that much soda with the meals?????,0.0,1.0
0,I came inside to place a take-out breakfast order because it was going to be a little bit complicated; and while they were cooking fresh eggs the manager offered me a free drink while I waited.

0," 5 Guys opened up about 2 years ago and I have always received very consistent taste and service from this location  It is situated right next to Rumbi's Island Grill and I always struggle with healthy food or greasy food for lunch. It's a 50/50 coin toss on which one I end up walking into. (I do however prefer the 5 Guys burger to the Rumbi's burger) What I would pass on is the California Pizza Kitchen next door; man has this chain gone down hill; talk about a rip off.  5 Guys burgers & fries are cooked fresh to order; another words you have to wait for them. They cook in the open ... right in front of you ... not sure what some of these other reviews are on about.  They use fresh potatoes for their fries and fry them in peanut oil at at higher temperature than normal vegetable oil; they come out very crunchy and golden brown. They kick butt all over In & Out french fries IMO; and 1 order is enough for 2 people.   Their burgers are twice as thick as In & Out; twice as tasty IMO; and a good value when you consider the amount of toppings and meat you receive. I also like munching those ree\   peanuts and tossing the shells on the floor while I wait for my order.  I guess I am a fan of 5 Guys burgers;  also a fan of Smash Burgers; and Delux too.                            All different; all good ... depends on my mood!   ",0.0,0.0
0," After posting about a visit to the Tempe location on facebook; a buddy expressed a desire to check out Five Guys.  I met him at the Val Vista location today for lunch with my 4 month old and he brought his 6 year old.    As always; the place was very clean; and although it was lunchtime on a weekend; we were through the line quickly (must have been before the Mormons got out of services).  We both ordered cheeseburgers and his son got a grilled cheese; along with a large order of regular fries.  My buddy loves CheesburgerCheeseburger; so I was anxious to hear how FG compares.  He took his first bite and had a very suprisingly pleased look on his face.  The double patty cheeseburger; complete with plenty of accoutrement; was jucy and flavorful. After a previously distatetful experience with the cajun fries; the regular fries are absolutly superior.    The staff at this location gets extra points for checkin in on us (they knew we had a first timer on our hands) and going the extra mile.  I wanted my friend to check out the cajun fries; but they didn't have any cooked up; so they just gave us some spice to put on the extra fries that we had.  Then; they called the 6 year old over to the counter and gave him a WHOLE NEW FRESH bag of cajun fries.  \We didn't have any samples for you; so we decided to just cook you up a whole batch.\    Seriously awesome service!    Sure; the lunch for 2.5 of us cost $25; and I'd only really go for something special; but I have a feeling every visit will be quite excellent!   ",1.0,1.0
0,Second time through yesterday...  Down grading my review.  There is nothing that stands out to make this place better than just another burger.    I ordered with different toppings. Stayed simple with Bacon; mushrooms; and of course jalapenos.. Order fries and a drink.  $12.00..    It was just a burger.  It was o.k. but not worth the $12.00 price. Honestly; Wendy's goes down better for me. Fries are just not doing it for me. I ordered regular. Added lot's of salt and ketchup and that helped.  It must be a taste thing; I just like my fries crispy.  I would still go back if in the area and wanting a burger.  But will also favor the In & Out or other places if I am going that direction instead.,0.0,0.0
0," Let me start off by saying; I walked in to this establishment wanting to give this place 5 stars.  I want it to succeed.  I wanted a damn good burger.  I've eaten Five Guys before on the east coast.  I am no stranger to their wonderful concept.  Fresh products and amazing taste at a reasonable price.  I've eaten some amazing burgers at other Five Guys places.  Every burger you order is a double.  It says on the menu \cheeseburger\   but it's a double cheeseburger.  Also a large fry will feed 2 (I'll get to that later)  Also all the toppings are included in the price.  Their toppings are about as generous as Subways toppings.  Plenty of variety.  Both the wife and I had a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushroom; lettuce and mayo and ketchup.  It's about a 10 minute wait for your food.  They have peanuts to keep you entertained while you wait.    As I rip into this greasy bag of goodness; I notice that my burger looks terrible.  I mean worse that any burger I have ever had at an greasy fast food joint.  The bottom bun is ripped to shreds; the toppings are falling everywhere including the meat and cheese.  Did the cook miss and not bother to fix his mistake?  At first I thought they served me a single burger but then under all the cheese I see another patty the size of a silver dollar.  I was so hungry and with my family; I was not in the mood to complain (oh and I can complain) I ate that burger in pieces because it was impossible to pick up.  I was so sad.  My wifes burger was fine.  She loved it but has had better.  The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.  They are fresh cut and cooked to perfection.  Best part about them; they fill up the container then add an additional scoop in the bottom of the bag.  Overall; I am going to give this place one more shot.  One more opportunity to show me why this place is Zagat rated.  If it doesn't you better believe this time I am going to get my money back.  Let me know how your experience went here.  I hope it was an isolated incident.   ",0.0,0.0
0,A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had; however; it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce; tomato; etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also; the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said; a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods.,1.0,1.0

0," I don't discriminate against a good tasting burger. Five Guys does not disappoint. Their cajun fries are good (and please note their \small\   size is not small at all). You select all your toppings when you order (tomatoes; mushrooms; onions; BBQ or A1 sauce; etc). If you haven't tried one of their burgers; don't pass this place up.   ",0.0,0.0

Messed up order twice; cold and hard buns; cold burger; and staff that spent too much time dicking around and not enough time doing their jobs or providing the type of service 5 guys is known for.

0,One of the Best Fast Food Burgers Around.   Im not typically a burger person.  However; occasionally I get a craving and Five Guys always hits the spot.  Five Guys is a chain burger restaurant but unlike any other.  The burgers at Five Guys are always fresh;hot; and juicy.  The burgers are tender; tasty; and well seasoned. In addition; to great burgers are Five Guys Fries.  Do not order a large order of fries.  The large of fries  is not large it is enormous; it is a lunch bag full of fries.  My nephew; sister and I barely made a dent in them.  Five Guys burgers are the closest you will come to burgers you cooked yourself.  Five guys allows you to  customize your burger with cheese; bacon; grilled onions; mushroons; and to many other toppings to name.   If customizing your burger isn't enough; you can do the same with your drinks.  Five Guys soda fountain  has every coke product from mello yello to dasani water. You select your base soda and and then add flavors  like cherry; peach; or lime.  So you can customize your drink as much as your burger.      Prices are reasonable; employees are friendly and accommodating;  and the service is quick.,1.0,1.0

0,First time at Five Guys today on Litchfield Rd.  I was greeted properly by the young lady at the counter which is always a good start.  She asked me if I had eaten there and I told her it was my 1st time; and she politely helped me through the menu options.  Good service for sure.  The burger was delicious; nothing incredibly different; however Five Guys give you options for your toppings and they have them all it seems.  The fries were cooked well- but were too salty in my opinion.  Plus I ordered a large fry; and there were too many too eat!  Not like that's a bad thing; but a medium fry would probably suffice for two people here. Five Guys also has the new soda dispensary system where you can choose on a digital screen what you would like to drink.  I love these things mostly cause you can get any flavor mixed into your lemonade which is fantastic!  Lastly the price.  It wasn't inexpensive.  I paid about $12 for the meal; which for a burger and fries is kind of pricey.  I would return to Five Guys; but mostly for the burger which was the highlight of my meal.  Nothing out of the ordinary; but a solid lunch none the less and I enjoyed my first meal at Five Guys.,1.0,1.0
0,This place was way overpriced for the food you get.  With the exception of the fries- they did give us a lot of fries; for a medium order. I found them dry; and strongly tasted of potato skin though.    My son ordered the bacon burger; there was no bacon; and the burger was small for the $6 it cost.  My daughter had the grilled cheese with some toppings; they left off the tomato (her favorite part).  Yes; I could have gone up and asked them to correct the order; but they were super busy and it took forever to get our food in the first place.   My husband got the blt.  Nothing special about it. I got the regular single patty burger; just ok.  My family and I agreed that we won't go back.  We actually prefer other fast food burger places that give you more for your money.,0.0,0.0
0,Love this place!  Like the one in Tempe; they also have the newer Coke machines which I LOVE! I was excited to see it since I was able to try it out when I was in Atlanta a couple of years ago; even before they were in any stores or restaurants.  It took me back to being in junior high making a drink with everything on the fountain.    My burger was just as ordered and my fries were fresh and crunchy.

0,picked up burgers for the in laws after a horrible day at the surgery center. So; my review is based on the feedback from them; and our experience ordering. Mr C and I have not personally tried the burgers yet; but we will.   Monday night; around 7:15 PM. The place is packed. Yes; its noisy and has hard rock music playing; loudly.  Good thing we knew ahead of time that the folks wanted the 'little' burgers; otherwise we would have ordered them a regular.. which is huge. Also; we started to order large fries; but the gal at counter said; you may only want the regular; which is enough for 2-2.5 people.  So; for $13 bucks; we ordered a little cheeseburger; and a little hamburger and specified what we wanted on them and a regular french fry.   We stood and watched as the 10+ orders ahead of ours were prepared; and it was a pretty smooth operation. The burgers are fried on a flat top grill; and the toppings looked of good quality and liberal.   Oh.. lots of peanuts to be had; so if you have a severe peanut allergy; you will want to avoid this place.   I picked up dad next morning for his post op appointment and he was quick to say how good the burgers and fries were.    So; Mr C & I will give this place a try one of these days and then Ill update my review from my perspective on the burger.,0.0,0.0

0,I eat at this location nearly every day and the other comments here about the friendliness of the staff are spot on. They are both having fun and providing excellent service. It really does make a difference!  I found chipotle after discovering I have a gluten sensitivity. I find that I have no bad reaction to the food here even without asking for glove or utensil changes. Nothing on the menu except flour tortillas is off limits    If you are celiac you may consider asking for allergy precautions of course. Also; other locations may no be as good as this one about such issues.  The chipotle chain like any other has weaker and stronger locations. This chipotle is absolutely tops in my book.,1.0,1.0
0,This has always been my goto Chipotle and great until recently my online orders were getting messed up. Missing tortillas on the side and guac. Not sure if there has been management changes or something but also  a lot less chips are being given in the bag. $1.30 for 25 chips? Might as well go to the store and buy a whole bag of Tostitos instead. Disappointed in recent experiences here when i order at least once a week :(,0.0,0.0
0,Let me preface this review by telling you; I'm the biggest Chipotle fan there is.  I visit them whenever and wherever I can.  I love it so much that I've been a long-time (small) shareholder of CMG stock.  So it pains me to say that I'm not sure what the deal is with this Chipotle; but the staff here just seems a bit off compared to other locations.  First; nearly every other CMG I've been to around the country takes great pride in cleanliness.  On my last few visits to this one I've had to wipe my own table clean on more than one occasion.    Second; they just do not seem well-trained.  My wife made the mistake of ordering a margarita one night and the guy working had to scrounge around for the materials and even ask a co-worker how to make the drink.  Another example; yesterday; my son ordered a cheese quesadilla and the crew basically forgot about it and what resulted was an overcooked crunchy slab of goo.    Lastly; their speed lacks a sense of urgency you find at the other stores.  Again; on yesterday's visit; the guy working who was our first point of contact..you know the guy that grabs the tortillas or bowls based on your order?  Well; he had to change out the bean containers with fresh beans.  This process caused a huge bottleneck because none of his co-workers down the line from him felt the need to jump in and help him either with the beans or with getting us started.  What was a relatively short line of maybe 6 people quickly grew to one reaching the door for no good reason.     I would hope Mr. Ells makes a visit to check-in on this location and somehow rights the ship.  Until I hear different; I'll stay away from this store and go to the one at Power/Ray or Val Vista/Baseline.,0.0,1.0

0,Service INSIDE can be slow sometimes; since they seem to worship the drive-thru customers and get all of their orders first; or at least with significant priority.  Staff is polite.  It's a real PITA to have to get refills from them though; instead of having the soda dispensers out for self-serve.  Are they really saving much money by doing this?  When there are lines of people to order; it's a bit much to butt in line to ask for a refill... or maybe that's the point.,1.0,1.0

0,I can't believe I'm having to write this review as most of my encounters at this location have been nothing but pleasant.  Well not today!  I come in around 2pm to pick up a late lunch for myself and a co-worker.  Line is fine; no issues there.  I order a burrito bowl to go with white rice and black beans.  I know the drill.  Then I get to the barbacoa.  It's the bottom of the barrel only the fatty pieces left; so I say you know what; I'd rather wait for the next batch.  She looks at me like I'm crazy.  She's like what do you mean.  Again; I'm like I'd rather wait for the next batch than get what's left.  Now here's what pissed me off.  She turns around and laughs and says something to the other dude in Spanish. Oh no she didn't.   I should have left right then and there and I wish I had.    Look; they're going to have to bring out a fresh batch for the next person anyway and I said I'm fine waiting.  I don't get what the big deal was.  Haven't any of you ever gone to a pizza place; saw the last dry slice all by itself and said you'd wait for a fresh pie?  So then she calls me over with some dry pieces that they brought from the back in a new bowl.  Seriously?  I'm not dumb chic.  I'll wait for the next batch.  As I'm waiting a couple minutes later another guy walks up and says the same thing and she's like; no problem it'll just be a couple minutes.  Oh really?  I see how this goes.  I mean; come on.  How hard was that?  Like I said I've been here before; made small talk; joked around with the other staff and walked out with a smile.

0,ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town; but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.    ToGo's origins are NorCal; with a huge following there.  Here; they've met with mixed results so far; closing some locations including one in Scottsdale.   Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling; with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there; but this one is much larger.   My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.  The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub; or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL  There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink; see photo.   So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.,0.0,1.0
0,I had my first experience with Raising Cane's today.  I got the Three Finger Meal and; for fast food; it was pretty good.  The breeding on the chicken was not overdone and; although not very seasoned; tasted pretty good.  They serve crinkle cut fries here; which I'm not usually a fan of but were actually decent.  The meal also came with Texas toast which basically was like a grilled half of a hot dog bun.  It was ok; if a bit of a gimmick.  The meal stood fine on its own without the extra carbs of the bread.  Lastly; the fresh squeezed lemonade was good.  Not overly sweet.    I guess the thing I liked best was the atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.  The location I ate at is pretty new so they may still be in the honeymoon stage; but I'd definitely return should I get a craving for chicken fingers again.,1.0,0.0

0,Was kind of excited to check this plcae out. Especially since my kids love chicken fingers and order that wherever we go. Walked in and loved the charm of this place; big posters of Elvis; Beatles; movie posters like Hangover 2; dispecible me... Catchy music blaring and a disco ball hanging over the register area. My kids loved it already; but once we got over all of that and read the small menu I was shocked. I looove chicken fingers; but I just can't believe that's all they had along with fries and cole slaw..that's it ? Really??... we went ahead and ordered; the food was very good;but we really wanted other things than just fries. They need more sides; more choices in dipping sauce. The kids wanted ranch; not the peppery ;tangy sweet sauce they offered. Hubby wanted mashed potatos n' gravy and wasn't crazy about the runny cole slaw; I would have loved some buffalo wing sauce..but all they had was fries; toast; cole slaw and their special sauce. Like I said food was good; atmosphere charming; but no choices in menu. Everyone gets the same thing basiclly. I will be back though; food was good; simple and I know kids will eat it!,0.0,1.0
0,KFC move aside!  If you're looking for some really tasty non-greasy fried chicken; then look no further as this is the place to come.  Be warned though they only serve chicken fingers! The place can be a little crowded as it was on the weekend we visited so you may have to wait for a seat to open up if you're looking to dine in.  Alternatively you can choose the drive through but that line was long.   The restaurant was clean; well lit; and spacious though there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables/chairs. Service was fast and the menu was very simple which I'm in favor of!   Ordered the 3-piece basket and a lemonade.  The lemonade wasn't too sweet but cool; refreshing and tasted as if it was fresh squeezed. The fries was plentiful and was shared.  The basket comes with a slice of buttered toast similar to Texas Toast which was soft; chewy and practically melted in your mouth. The chicken tenders was well seasoned; crispy; not greasy; tasty; juicy but what really stands out is that it was light.  It's filling but you don't feel that overstuffed after eating them.  I really like the simplified menu; the lemonade drinks; and the chicken tenders which is definitely a draw for me to be back here!,1.0,1.0
0,Alright place to go if you want to try some slightly overpriced chicken strips. I ordered the standard box combo and the food was made quickly. (You definitely get your money's worth on the portion-size).  The chicken itself is nothing spectacular; I like the strips at Chick-fil-A a lot better. The sauce is unique and I'd definitely try it ; though the sample they gave me was a bit watery.,0.0,1.0
0," This is a newer chicken place in town. They server Chicken Fingers; Toast; Fries; and their special Sauce. If anyone has ever been to Lucky Wishbone in Tucson; it very much reminds me of their chicken fingers meal. It is excellent and their homemade lemon aid is to die for. We always have to order extra because we fight over it.   Slightly pricy for a fast food place; but you do get the quality you pay for and they have a club called the Caniac Club you can sign up for and get free meals.  Whats not to love?

0," Five Guys is good eats.  We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.  Honestly; I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger; but I like the selection of toppings (can you say; resh jalapenos!\  ) and the great selection of sodas.  The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.  I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!); but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.  Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week; it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours; unless you want to wait for a table.  Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out; but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.  3 tips:  -Our family of 4 (2 adults; 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries; though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.  -Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker \  Little Cheeseburger\   fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the \  Little\   one is perfectly sufficient for me; especially after I load up on toppings.  -Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and \  POOF!\  ; you'll get it!  Enjoy!  UPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to 4 stars.  The last several visits; the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!   ",0.0,0.0
0,My sister and I picked up lunch Saturday. We got 2 bacon double cheeseburgers and 1 large fry; the total was $20. The burger was worth every penny. They have a wide variety of toppings and the burger is made when you order it.   The burger & fries were so filling that I skipped dinner that night and fell asleep shortly after I ate.

0," YES; I am only give Five Guys 2 stars! Can you believe it? Me; the woman who raved about having a Five Guys in the area. The woman; who LOVED; LOVED; LOVED Five Guys when I lived in Virgina. This Five Guys does not even begin to compare to how they do it in VA.   I was so excited about getting a burger and fries today. I mean I was \cheating\   by going for a burger and fries instead of working out. Walking into this Five Guys I was excited. The staff were friendly; the place was spotless; and they were getting orders out fast. So I ordered my little bacon cheeseburger with jalapenos; mustard; grilled onions and mushrooms and a order of regular fries. About 7 mins later I was out the door and headed home. The food smelled heavenly in the bag and I couldn't wait to get home to devour my meal.   I get home; open the bag and grabbed a few fries. Yum; we are off to a good start. I dig to the bottom of my bag and grab my burger. I slowly unwrap it; take a bite; and say WTF? Where is the meat? I swear that burger lacked flavor and meat. I mean I remember when even the little burger was still to big. Yes I know that the little bacon cheeseburger means it only comes with one patty; but does it have to be the thinnest hamburger patty ever? I mean McDonald's even has a bigger burger than this sandwich did. I was so disappointed. The best part of my sandwich was the bacon and the toppings since the actual burger was more like spread. At least I had enough fries to feed myself and two friends and they were pretty good.   So two stars. One star for the fast friendly service and one star for all the fries I could eat and for the bacon on my burger. Otherwise you get a big fat FAIL!!!!!!! I may give you a chance to redeem yourself in a few months but the next time I go; you had better bring it!   PS I ended up going to work out anyway since I was so disappointed! FAIL!   ",0.0,0.0
0,OMG this is a great burger. Better then In -N- Out. Everything is made fresh. This burger is just the right thickness. I not a huge fan of really thick burgers so this place works for me. The burgers are juicy and they have lots of toppings you can pile on. The 1 and only complaint is this is one of those places that tries to sell you fries separate. Of course they always say - our small order is enough for 2-. This bothers me cause when I go to a fast food type place I'm usually by myself and I need fries for one not fries for 2. Now your $5 burger turns into $10 when adding a drink and fries. So unless your someone that goes here to get a burger and a burger only you will never spend just $5 here. The sad thing is all the fries they are waisting when your forcing one Person to by enough fries for 2. Aside from that the burger is great but unfortunately for $10 burgers these days i can go to so many places like fez and or grinders. This place needs a combo meal for around $7 and I would stop here more often.,0.0,0.0
0," Decent burgers; really friendly service; and a very basic; straightforward menu.     I was interested in trying this place out after reading all the rave reviews from all over the country so when it finally opened up in Phoenix; I decided to give it a shot.         The burgers are definitely good; done very well; the fries are great tasting too and they give you A LOT of them; if you go and order the \large fries\   you're going to find a whole paper sack absolutely filled to the brim with them.               All in all; Five Guys is a nice place to grab a quick lunch; a little bit on the pricy end for fast food but there is a difference in quality between this place and the McBurgerBarns out there; that's for sure.

0," 3.75   FTR I am NOT a fan of flat fried burgers; I prefer grilled over a flame. Man I love the taste of a fire kissed hunk of ground beef.   I read a few reviews and thought I should at least try the burger. I am glad I did.   Hand pattied; fresh burgers; flat grilled to well done but still juicy. The beef had almost 0 flavor by itself but added nice texture to the entire burger as a whole. As a burger 	raditionalist\   I ordered the regular with bacon; lettuce; tomato's; pickle and mustard. No Jalapenos or cool little add ons. The condiments were all really fresh and had good flavor. (most tomato's lack this now a days) The double patty was a little much; I may go with the single next time.   The building was busy with customers and staff; they run a tight ship.   The prices can get a little high unless you eat smart; the frys are large; the burgers are large and the drinks are $2.19 for a large. Get the single burgers; share a fry and get water or skip the frys and eat the free peanuts.LOL   I will go back.  4 stars for a flat top grilled burger... must have been good.   ",0.0,0.0
0,I finally stopped in here for the first time! First of all; the girl at the register was super nice about explaining the menu and ordering process for us first-timers. I also like the free peanuts while you wait for your order. I ordered a little burger with bacon and the bacon was fantastic. It was crispy and they were not stingy with it. My husband ordered a regular cheeseburger. He said the cheese wasn't that great. I like the fact that they are hand formed patties but mine was falling apart which was kind of annoying. The fries were really good as well and I would like to go back to try the cajun style ones. On a side note; my sister went into the bathroom while we were there and she said it was clean and smelled like cinnamon so thats a plus as well! Overall; the food was good; but nothing to die for.,1.0,0.0
0,This was the first 5 Guys I ever ate at. A simple; high quality burger. Meat; meat; meat! I've never had a soggy fry here. Never order a large fry; only a normal one. You get enough for two hungry guys!  Good service. They get the order right; 95% of the time.  Do check at the display; though; as a dining partner got bacon when they didn't want it.   Really busy; but lots of parking. Writing this review makes me hungry for one; now.,1.0,1.0
0,Another cool place found through yelp ... and not just me; I bumped into fellow yelpers Daren C. and Ryan C. here at lunch. They came here because; like me; they read a review for this place posted earlier today. Because it was lunchtime; the place was busy; but the line moved quickly enough and the people taking the orders were friendly. I enjoyed the baconburger I ordered - quite a stack; with crispy bacon; two patties; plus the condiments I ordered (lettuce; tomato; pickles; ketchup; mustard); and the fries were great - thicker than at most places; adequately salted; and a nice balance of softness and slight crispiness. Plenty of places to sit; especially since they have a nice patio for al fresco dining ... and don't forget to serve yourself with the peanuts in the shell to munch on while waiting for your number to be called.,1.0,1.0
0," Love this place!  Went yesterday with a friend and had a great burger experience. I noticed a definite \50's vibe\   going on when we were greeted by a friendly worker behind the cash register.  Unique burger options and love the fact that their \  toppings\   don't cost anything extra. Had the single cheeseburger sans onions and Cajun fries - very fresh and tasty!  Was surprised they didn't have ranch dressing or cook-to-order meat (they only grilled medium well).  Big fan of their soda machines! Literally had SO many options such as PowerAde (and Zero) with raspberry; grape; etc etc. You could even order Sprite with grape! Huge accolades there.  Food impressed me as well as the set-up and cheery service. Great job!   ",1.0,1.0
0,I have been to five guys on several occasions. Love the burgers and fresh fries. On this visit the man running the register gave us great advice on ordering fries a certain way which saved me some cash and still gave my family plenty of fries.

0,Wanted a burger for dinner and wanted to try something new. My first impression wasn't the greatest. They have bags of their french friends and boxes of oil all over the place as a display! Is this their idea of decor or did they just run out of room in the back? The music is SO LOUD you can't even think. I can barely hear the girl as I was trying to give her my order.   You mean to tell me the $6.99 cheeseburger is ONLY a cheeseburger? No fries or anything with it? Almost $12 for a cheeseburger and fries? NO DRINK. That's crazy!! I didn't realize it was that expensive until I was ordering and I didn't want to embarrass myself and walk away. I figured I'd try it.  I do have to say; the food is very good. Fries were delicious. Burger was good too but really sloppy.   Would I go again? Probably not. The price is just out of control! $12 for a burger and fries is just insane!

0,I finally had Five Guys. We made 800 jokes on the way; after we ordered; I swore the cashier told us to enjoy some penis while we waited. Excuse me? Oh. Peanuts. Of course; all burger joints have peanuts?! A bit bizarre; but they were tasty. We all ordered a burger to our liking and we shared cajun fries. My cheeseburger with grilled onions and jalapenos was good; it tasted like something you'd make at home. The fries were terrible. Not sure how they've earned such recognition. I like crisp fries; these were flimsy and greasy; and I wasn't a fan of cajun seasoning; either. Overall; I stand by In-N-out.,0.0,0.0
0," I used to be an In-N-Out fan but Five Guys is now my new favorite new fast food burger joint.  I think Five Guys gives you a good value for its price. The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings (from mushrooms to peppers) to add on your burger. Also; their fries are pretty good; though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones.  Be sure to tell them you want a \little\   hamburger or cheeseburger or they will give you a double patty burger.   ",0.0,1.0
0," Just moved to Phoenix from Southern California and while exploring the area stumbled on Five Guys.  I was excited because I have friends in Philly that tout this place.  We headed over at about 2 to let the lunch rush die down--we only had 3 people in front of us but the restaurant was about 75% full.    I ordered the cheeseburger and DH got the bacon cheese burger both \all the way\  .  We each got a small order of fries; mine regular his cajun style.  We were #68; so we got our drinks; sat down and waited (opted out of getting peanuts).  It took less the 5 minutes for our food to be up and boy am I glad we didn't get peanuts.    The burgers were double pattied with sauted shrooms; onions; pickles; lettuce; tomatoe and ketchup and mustard.  The french fries came in small cups but there were at least that many at the bottom of the bag too....no way we would eat all of those.  Next time 1 small order.  I now also understand what a \  little\   burger is on the menu; it must be one pattie.  The burgers were good; sloppy with all that stuff; but really good flavor.  Glad they were wrapped in foil so I had something to hold it all together with.  The fries were done in peanut oil (I assume).  Not cripsy but I don't think they were supposed to be.  They were good; but the cajun was a bit much.    The price was reasonable just $20 for two big burgers; 2 fries and 2 drinks.  Will definitely go again.   ",0.0,0.0
0,After hearing a bit about Five Guys online; I decided to give them a try.  First impression walking in was very positive.  I liked the decor and the free self-serve peanuts.     Unfortunately; that did not last.  My jaw literally hit the floor when I saw the prices.  Over $5 for a hamburger from a counter-service (i.e. fast-food) restaurant?  Worse yet; I had my three kids with me and Little Cheeseburgers are over $4 each.  I have to say we almost walked out; but I still wanted to try it.   So we proceeded with ordering.   I got the hamburger with french fries.  The hamburger was very good.  No doubt about that.  The french fries were okay; but nothing special.  If the burger would have been $3 - $4; I'd probably say it was one of the best I've had in that price range.  At over $5 though; there are many just as good if not better options.  Bottom line: good food; but way overpriced.,0.0,0.0
0," Man; I guess I just don't get it. I've tried this place twice now; and was unimpressed both times. I really don't understand the excitement over this place.  Just another example of how Eastern transplants to the Phoenix area clamor for anything from \BACK HOME.\   Plus; this place is way too expensive for an \  Order at the Counter\   burger joint.  Went in last time with a buddy: 2 REG burgers; 1 REG order of fries to split; NO DRINKS - $17.02 WOW! Not to mention (but I will); that it took over 15 minutes to get my order; when this place was nearly empty!!!  The burger was bland and overcooked. The bacon was burnt and crumbled; not even in strips; but looked like somebody just put some charred bac-o-bits on it. High marks for the freshness of the toppings; but so what. After all; it's not called \  5 Guys Toppings;\   is it.  And the fries couldn't be worse if you were actually trying to make them BAD. Just a bland; greasy mess. Yuck.

The guys I went to lunch with all got the big burger and I have to say; I couldn't tell the difference.  So don't let it scare you like it did me.  All in all it was a very tasty; greasy burger.  Medium fries are more than enough.  I don't particularly care for fries with skin still on though. I liked that they gave you peanuts to snack on while you wait because the wait was a little longer than I would have expected for fast food.,0.0,1.0
0," Having tried Five Guys on the East Coast (where they originated) and liking their Burgers; I was very excited at the new location; so close to home.   My first experience was with Fried Onions only. Unfortunately; I believe the onions (which are NOT fried to order) gave the Burger a \chemical taste.\   The fries have a nice taste but will order them well done in the future; in order to avoid the sogginess.   Not dissuaded by a NOT GREAT experience; my next trip I tried the \  traditional\   lettuce; tomato and mayonnaise. Very little taste and the Burger; while large enough with two patties; seemed overwhelmed by the mayonnaise. Well done Fries were better than the first.   \  Third time is the charm\   I thought.   The acid test would be \  pickles and mustard.\   If the burger was good; it would stand up to this; as do Fudruckers and Steak and Shake. Alas; not to be! The Burgers flavor did not make it through the mustard. Unfortunate; but Five Guys will NOT be on my Burger list in the future.   ",0.0,1.0

I knew the menu was gonna be different because they are separately owned franchises. However; the food was still on point.   I got the chicken tenders; fries and a drink REAL SIMPLE.  The chicken was hot and spicy very good; and the service was pretty quick took less than 10 minutes there was a good amount of ppl waiting inside as well as outside chilling outside.   I def would go back here over popeyes or churches!   4 STARS,0.0,1.0
0," I've been to this location several times and I really do enjoy the food. the chicken is always crunchy and spicy. The fries are seasoned with season salt. The rolls that come with the meal are decent considering they are store bought. The catfish and shrimp appear and taste to have the same spicy batter as the chicken. This place is super small so don't expect to eat here; it's a takeout place. There are  two small tables inside and two outside but I highly doubt you can get a seat. I highly recommend phoning your order ahead of time and then picking it up because it can get crowded and the service can be painfully slow. \like\   them on Facebook to get insider offers.

0,There are very few foods I crave as comfort food splurges more than Fried Chicken or Pizza.  I had been wanting fried chicken for a few days and Friday afternoon thru Saturday evening are my splurge days.  Wanting to try something new and different ( I usually end up at Churches) I turned to my trusty Yelp app.    I hopped in my car and drove south to a shopping center on Baseline and 20th Street.  It is a small shop with just a few tables for dine-in.  One person was waiting ahead of me and as I placed my order; the fryer timer went off.  The guy who took my order then politely excused himself  and scrambled to the back kitchen area in response to the timer.   Poor guy was the only one here at the store today.  Forced to work the register and the fryers; but he was handling it well.  He was very polite and provided great service.  (4 Stars for service)  I ordered a 10 piece Shrimp and Fries and an 8 piece chicken (only chicken).    My order was prepared right then after ordering.  Makes all the difference in the world when it comes to fried foods.  Taking my order to go; I dug into the fries on the way home (you have to enjoy them while they are hot right?) They were awesome.  The shrimp were intermingled with the hot fries and both had been well seasoned with a spicy cajun salt.  Hot; salty (in a good way) and perfectly spicy.  Once home I enjoyed the shrimp with their spicy southern fried coating (not a thick dry breading).   I would absolutely go back just for the shrimp and fries.  As for the chicken it was just ok.  I didn't find it any better than fried chicken I can get at the grocery deli.  For me I still prefer Churches Chicken but wouldn't rule the chicken out here completely.  (3 Stars for the Chicken)  In the future I would love to try their chicken tenders or nuggets and will absolutely go back for the shrimp.,1.0,1.0
0,This little place just opened in a strip mall and you'd probably miss it if you didn't know it was there. Fortunately; I knew thanks to a well-timed coupon arriving in the mail.  The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings. I had coleslaw and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides and they were great. The gravy had just the right kick and the coleslaw was among the best I've ever tasted.  They also carry fried shrimp which I'll be back to try and they have many other sides including fried okra for those with the stomach for such things.  Friendly; helpful; and quick counter service in this to-go-only restaurant. It's small; but it has a big heart. It's part of a chain of restaurants; but this is the only one in Arizona so far.

So while walking around Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall; I couldn't resist ordering a double cheeseburger with mayo and steak sauce plus grilled onions that would tie me over for dinner.  As it turns out Korean dinner wasn't anything to write home about.  The one thing I did notice different about this FGB&F is no peanuts to have while waiting for my order. What's up with that ?  One thing can be said is that their burgers are of consistent quality no matter which store. Like others; the place neat and super clean.,0.0,0.0

0,I LOVE 5 GUYS so much that I decided this was where I was going for lunch in the Scottsdale Fashion Square. The order was quick; the cashier was friendly and seemed to really like her job. She was amazing. Also; the order was done pretty quickly despite a long line of people of waiting for their food.  But here is why they get 1 star: The greasy-faced young teenager at the end of the line decided that when he called my number; he was going to wait only 2 seconds before putting my burger in its bag back in a place away from the other food. I tried getting his attention 3 or 4 times after I approached the counter; which is farther than 2 seconds away no matter where you sit (go there and you'll see). I didn't know his name since he was facing away from me. He was getting the fries out of the fryer so I understood he didn't want to overcook and waste them; so I wasted a few more seconds before saying excuse me louder when he was not busy.  He continue to call out other numbers and ignored that at this point I was leaning on the counter with impatience. I asked if I could get my burger and he turned around and put more fries into the deep frier. Only about 5 minutes later; after being obviously upset; did another employee who was a dirty blonde male notice after coming out from the back and grabbed my bag from where the other employee put it on top of the fries heating lamp.  As I snatched it and stated I was waiting a while and tried getting the other guy's attention; he seemed confused. As I walked away he said to have a great day; and if there were not children in the space I would have flipped them off. To be honest; though; he actually made me feel taken care of in comparison to the other employee who was blatantly ignoring me.  One star for the amazing cashier and the kindness of the other gentleman; of course the food was on point but I waited entirely too long for it; and despite the fact that it was on top of the heating lamp for the fries; half the burger was cold. I'll go to other 5 Guys locations in the future.,1.0,0.0
0," Thank god for somewhere being open till a decent hour (10pm) on a Saturday night in the far east valley.  This strange sub shop in the Dana Park area was better than I hoped.  I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak (which they call a \steak & cheese\  ) not expecting a whole lot but still having visions of the amazing cheese steak sliders from District.  The whole process took a bit longer than I expected since there were 5 guys behind the counter and we were the only ones there but it was still quicker than any Mr Goodcents I've ever been to.  The sandwich was a lot smaller than I expected.  The bread is similar in girth to a hotdog bun only longer.  They crammed a decent amount of meat and cheese in there to make a pretty good value.  I would have been happy if it had come toasted or baked but instead they gave it to me steamed.  Why anyone would want their bread steamed is beyond me.  It makes it soggy and spongy.  Really; it ruined what would have been a great sandwich.  If you are feeling adventurous; or you like steamed bread; then go check this place out.  Otherwise; maybe just ask them to microwave it.

0,Sorry to write a downer..  I ordered the Club sandwich fully involved (without the spicy mustard and onions); it was warm and drippy.. Warm is good; taste is good.. all good so far.. but the Drips from mayo :(; ugh i dont want wet spots on my slacks from lunch.    I also felt queasy afterwards; couldnt get the sub i had off my mind..   Ive had Firehouse sub in Florida years ago; it was fine. Maybe it's this location?  BTW i ordered online and i arrived a minute early from the expected time and my sub was ready; that was cool.    Subway seemed to be better?  maybe next time ill try a different sub and ask them to lay off on the mayo to prevent drips..i'll also ask around for favorite subs from firehouse.. maybe the club wasnt their specialty..   I felt like i was in a little firehouse with a lot of patrons.. :),0.0,0.0

0,Firehouse Subs is a great sandwich place.  The food is great and the employees are always very friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is nice and they also have one of those cool soda machines.  I work in the same plaza and my company has ordered a sandwich tray from them for lunch many times.  It's always ready on time and reasonably priced.,1.0,1.0
0,I judge my lunch and dinner places to a different set of criteria.  For lunch it's about convenience; cost; and taste.  A distant fourth criterion might be the relative nutritional value of the meal.  Firehouse; wins on the first three and is worthy of inclusion into the lunch time rotation.  The sandwiches are hearty; heavy; and tasty.  Denser and more robust flavors then you'd get at the chain sub spots.  I doubt that this place will win any accolades from the American Heart Association but I also doubt that 85% percent of its patrons even consider calorie counts when they order one of these sandwiches.    A great sub.  Just make sure you eat fruits; vegetables; and other healthy options when you're not here.,0.0,1.0
0," Firehouse is a solid sub shop and really isn't much more expensive than Subway.  They don't have a five dollar foot long; just better subs and a really cool soda machine.  The hot specialty subs are my favorite.  If I had to pick my favorite I would say its the \Engineer\   but every sub I have ever ordered; at any location; has been good.  They are consistent; friendly and the subs are huge.  Get your sub \  fully involved\   and there's no way you're leaving this establishment hungry.  If I want a sub sandwich and there is a Subway and Firehouse sitting across the road from each other; I'm going to Firehouse because the food is better and lets face it; firefighters are a lot cooler than Jared.

0,Today was the first time I ate In-N-Out here in Arizona and I'm proud to say that it was delicious. I've never been a fan of burgers; but In-N-Out was always the exception when I lived in California. It's something about the buns that make it so yummy. Anyways; I ordered a #2: a cheeseburger; fries; and a medium drink. Of course I animal styled them fries. Mm! So mouth watering. Their pink lemonade is really great too. If you're ever here; definitely give it a try.  The prices are so affordable. I never really checked out the prices when I used to live in California because I was never the one to buy the food so I never noticed how cheap everything is. I mean; it's seriously affordable. The meal is about $5.30 (+ tax) which is a normal meal price I guess; but the quality of the food is just perfect that you truly get your money's worth.  Another thing I love about this place is the staff. They are so sweet and outgoing. They're awesome! Anyone who is reading this must stop by at this In-N-Out and enjoy a delightful meal with friends or family.,1.0,1.0
0,In-N-Out Burger is a fun place to grab a bite to eat. The menu is fun with simple options that pack a good portion of flavor for a lunch or snack. Service is a tad slow considering they have hamburgers and hot dogs but the staf behind the counter were professional and nice.,0.0,0.0
0,Stopped by for lunch with some colleagues and ordered my normal Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans; Sour Cream; Guacamole; Rice; Hot Salsa.  Since the weather was awesome; we sat outside and enjoyed the day.  The Burrito was actually kind of small for Chipotle....I guess they were stingy that day.  The only downside to sitting outside is all of the birds that bother you and fly overhead....you have to be careful.  Next time; I'll probably sit inside.  Return Factor - 60%,0.0,1.0
0,The food is good but the portion they give you is terrible. I counted 10 steaks in my entire burrito; I got more rice than anything and very little cheese. I can't even taste the cheese. The chips are stale and very salty! The salsa is pretty good. The service was okay... Seems like they all were trying to talk and it was confusing me. If their portion size was better I'd be more satisfied.,0.0,0.0
0,I think I'm seriously missing something here. Am I the only person in the world that thinks Chipotle sucks? There isn't one thing on the menu that I enjoy. Not even the chips and salsa. How can you mess up chips and salsa??  EVERYONE I know loves this place. I feel like I'm an alien. Maybe they put something in their food that not only makes you bleed when you go the bathroom; but also hypnotizes you to think they have the best food when really its the worst.  My two most recent experiences are as follows:  A friend of mine insisted we go before a movie. I asked him if he really wanted to eat that garbage and then sit for two hours but he said yes. I watched him eat a burrito while I ate stale chips and the cashier made fun of me (YES HE MADE FUN OF ME! WHO DOES THIS?) for not ordering something. He actually asked me if I was watching my figure. I'm a skinny girl so it was really insulting to the bigger girls behind me in line. I could tell they were visibly offended.  Another time my boyfriend got a coupon for a free burrito for selling his books back to the school. I guess they figure that if you're stupid enough to sell your books back to the school instead of online then you're stupid enough to eat Chipotle. I went with him even if I didn't want anything. I just wanted to spend time with him. Well apparently everyone and their mother wanted Chipotle that day because the line was so long it went outside. The door was open so it was hot. Imagine every possible thing that could go wrong in a line happening at once. That's what it was. Sweaty people all over; screaming kids; crying babies; loud cell phone talkers; cutters.... Ugh. When we finally reached the front of the human labyrinth they almost didn't take his coupon even though it was completely valid.     In the end. Not a fan of the food; the experience; the staff; the building. No. Please someone tell me what I'm missing here!!,0.0,1.0
0,I am not a huge fan of their food but their service is spectacular. All the employees I've encountered are incredibly friendly. I usually don't order food; I just pick up a lemonade. I LOVE that lemonade! But if you are ordering food; the chicken sandwich is doable.,1.0,1.0
0,My family loves Chick-fil-a; and this is probably the location closest to me; but after at least 10 visits over the past couple of years; find their service to be friendly yet slow and inefficient.  I recommend taking the 202 two more exits to Power Rd; and visiting that location.  They have consistently great service; speed; and food quality.  I've been their more times than I'd like to admit; and never had a bad experience. In short; this is good; but great is just down the road.,1.0,1.0
0,My wife and I ate at this Chick-Fil-A this weekend and I liked it. She eats there all the time and has been trying to get me to go and I wasn't disappointed. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and some chicken tenders. Lemonade was awesome. More importantly the service was great. Everyone seemed to have such a great attitude which I appreciated. The person at the registrar was Camry and she was very helpful. We told her we were going to the movies and she told us where the theater was and how to get there quicker. I appreciated that she took the time to tells. My wife was impressed with how kid/baby friendly this place is. From diapers in the bathrooms to Cheerios in small cups for hungry kids; this place rocks!,1.0,0.0
0," We don't have fast food very often; but usually when we do we like to go to Chick Fil A.  Generally speaking; Chick Fil As are clean with polite; friendly employees and consistently good food.   This location is the exception to that rule.   The restaurant is constantly filthy in one way or another. It is still possibly a step up from some other fast food restaurants; but in the context of Chick Fil As standards; this one is completely sub par.  On one visit; I was standing in front of the counter while waiting for part of my order; and I noticed that my shoes were sticking to the floor. Initially I dismissed it and moved over; but found that I was STILL sticking to the floor. I looked down and found that there was a thick layer of sticky soda (movie theater floors x 1 million) that was now caked onto my shoes and causing me to stick to the floor even after I'd moved away from it. When I was finally able to catch an employee's attention to let them know; I was told \oh; there's a leak; we know about it\   with no further action (no one came to clean it up; at least temporarily; during our entire visit to the restaurant)   On another occasion; I went to get a child's booster seat and when I looked over the few seats available; found that each and every one of them was disgustingly caked with various food splattered all over them. I selected one that had the food mostly relegated to the edges and sides of the seat; and proceeded to grab several Purell packets to wipe it down myself. Several employees glanced at me during the process but weren't too terribly concerned apparently.   On a regular basis; there are consistently a variety of smaller but still obnoxious ongoing issues; such as overfull trash cans and gross bathrooms. Additionally; a tiny thing that I've noticed (and appreciated) at other Chick Fil As is that when you get a highchair; they always always have a sticky placemat laid over the back of the highchair - this is so nice; because when your hands are full of a baby; your food; etc; it is great that they are anticipating your needs by having this readily available; and having it on the highchair means it is one less thing you have to grab. However; at this Chick Fil A; it is extremely rare for the placemat to be on the highchairs; you pretty much always have to stop and pick it up separately. Again; it is small; but it does make a difference and just shows that they don't care quite as much about their customers as all of the other locations.  The staff at this location is nice enough in the scheme of fast food places; but again; does not really live up to the standards that I've come to expect from Chick Fil A as a brand. They are your typical teenaged fast food employees; where I usually find that Chick Fil A employees are respectful; polite; conscientious; and engaging; these employees tend to be a bit more removed; more interested in joking around with other employees; and while they go through the motions of decent service; they're missing that little extra that makes such a huge difference at other locations. Additionally; I usually see quite a bit of management presence on the floor at other locations; but it seems much rarer here. I've also observed managers being pretty rude to employees once or twice - most recently a manager belligerently ordering someone in the kitchen to get \  some soup that is actually hot\   in a very sarcastic tone with very angry body language.  The food is generally pretty much the same as other Chick Fil As; but our order does seem to be messed up more often here than at other locations. We usually order our sandwiches without pickles; and this only actually gets done about 50% of the time. It isn't a huge deal; but does completely change the flavor of the sandwich to a more pickly flavor; which no one in our family cares for.  If we had a location even only slightly further away; we would definitely make the trek; but as we are quite far from the next closest restaurant; we end up here anytime we need something quick; and each time we regret spending our money with this particular restaurant since it is so disappointing.

0,Chick FilA is one of the best fast food restaurants out there. They have really worked on the friendly-ness factor. BUT...This particular location has the most languid bunch of workers I've ever seen. I saw four people walk out because the 7 people working behind the counter didn't step up to wait on the customers -- they were too BUSY doing other stuff like paperwork; and stacking cups.   When it was my turn; I waited at the counter for 5 to 7 minutes in awe of the complete lack of service. Only one cash register was open while four more customers behind me waited to get somebody - anybody's attention. Plenty of employees were there all milling about and chatting amongst themselves. Hello???  Is there anything more important than the customers? Here's a case where they have gone out of their way to provide decent fast food; a clean environment; small extras like diapers in the bathrooms; fresh flowers; and great attitude by the employees; but then FORGOT to take their orders. I won't go back to this one.,0.0,0.0

My GF and I rolled in and we were certainly not the only customers. It seemed that this was a go-to place got a lot of people at that time of night. I ordered a chicken burrito; dark rice; cheese; salsa; sour cream; and lettuce. The employees were not skimpy with the ingredients... that warm burrito was packed to capacity!   Overall delicious!

0,Chick-Fil-A does a few things right.  They serve your food promptly out of a very clean restaurant with a very courteous staff!  They have a large play area for the tiniest customers and even have wipes to clean off their little hands before eating their little meals.    As a person who follows a Gluten-Free diet you ask what the heck are you doing here; let me share my secret.  They will make any of their salads with non breaded chicken.  Upon request they will also make naked chicken strips that are quite tasty.  My daughter loves the sweet tea where I like mine unsweetened.  They have waffle cut fries as one of the sides.    You are able to order off the lunch menu during breakfast if you don't find anything to your liking.

0,Well Hello There;  I must do a review here at Chick-fil-A on 16th Street and Camelback. This place is so clean; professional; and calm. I love the décor it is so cute and cozy and it promotes a longer stay and with that comes more money. But it is worth every dollars; dollar; pennies; penny; cents; and cent (Hahahaha) if you get my drift. They can have it! (Hahahaha)   The service I received was stellar by a man at the register named Vandell. He is customer service with a smile and with a friendly and professional demeanor. Boy; that man is awesome. I have never seen anything like it in fast food. I hope he is getting paid what he is worth. Or that would be a total shame on Chick-fil-A!   NOW THE FOOD: The regular chicken sandwich $3.19 minus the pickles was ohhhhhh sooooooo AMAZING! I have dismissed this restaurant brand for many reasons over the years to only discover: I WAS AN IDIOT! (Hahahaha) And I must be honest I was being cheap because a chicken sandwich just doesn't appeal to me or my wallet. But boy was I wrong; wrong; wrong; and I have missed out all these years. The sandwich was so juicy with every bite that I had to look at it and really look at it with every bite and to ask myself: IS THIS QUALITY REALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?  Man; YES IT WAS! I pulled out a waffle fry and with no salt to ensure its freshness and (I don't eat salt when cooking anyway) so the fries must be salt free. These fries were piping hot and perfectly crisp. The large fry was the perfect size for the meal. I didn't feel cheated in portion in any way. The fries were so hot; fresh; and crisp that I just couldn't resist another large fry. And for $1.95 for a large one; why should I not get another. GREEDY I know but OHHHHH well; they were just that magnificent. And McDonalds will not see me on fry excursions anymore! Waffle fries come to mamma! I will be glad to give you my $1.95 anytime! (Hahahaha)   The drink was so perfect in carbonation that I really enjoyed the ice cold Coke. Now should I have to say anything else? Oh yeah and by the way; I saw a salad at the table across from me and it was the prettiest green salad I have seen in a long time. I just cannot leave that out of this review.   I will be having many salad rendezvous' because the one I saw was so pretty and green. Trust me go try it and eat it! I did not go at a rush hour so if that may make a difference go when it's not busy. Enjoy and think of me sitting in a booth somewhere with no salt on my fries and my juicy grin; from my juicy sandwich. And these sandwiches have a super soft bun that does not over power the quality of the meat. Well enjoy and now I must go make up for my Chick-fil-A ignorance over all these years.

0," Somewhere between Costco and Starbucks I got hungry; and I didn't want samples. I spotted Chick Fil A on my way to get my afternoon caffeine fix; I said to my self; \oh sure why not\   Now it's been years since I ate there; last time was in Metro Center and I wasn't quite impressed.    First of Parking sucks here; especially with a full sized truck but I ended up across in front of Verizon since I'm still able to walk. I spotted three employees at the corner of the building; and figured that's where the entrance was; so in I went.   This place rocks. I wasn't more than 5 feet inside the store and I was greeted by a young man manning the registers; \  not bad\   I told my self. There was another couple in front and an older lady stepped up and took my order. I went for the #2 and thought to my self it was gonna be another BK; McD's type of chicken patty. I ordered was given a cone and started to find a seat; must've wandering around for about 30 seconds before I chose a seat but by that time my meal was ready.   The chicken \  patty\   was an entire chicken breast!!!! Nuff said. From a guys prospective; its a done deal; leave me alone; I'm eating; who cares about the decor....I'm eating.   Customer Service at this place rocks; they're the QT and Safe of Fastfood. Its clean; friendly and just awesome.   Know what? I'm going back next week; shoot; maybe even tomorrow.   ",1.0,1.0
0,First time at Chick Fil A was delicious! We went through the drive thru and had wonderful service! They helped us find exactly what we wanted. We ordered every sauce and a bunch of food!   Their special sauce was amazing and I really liked the Polynesian sauce. I just wish they had one in Las Vegas! Hopefully I can go back someday!,1.0,1.0
0,Most amazing chicken you can get anywhere I've grown up loving Chickfila chicken and now that there's one close by where I live I live it even more! The Summer Strawberry Salad is amazing as well it has chicken with strawberries and blueberries; cheese and granola! So yummy for my tummy! The only thing is they are a very religious franchise and they close on Sundays to honor their values ...which sadly is usually the day I most desire to eat there. Bummer but its all good. If its your FIRST TIME just order an original #1 chicken sandwhich make sure you have the special HONEY BBQ SAUCE and you will be dreaming all day wondering what you've been eatting all ur life! Next stop in I will be ordering a platter of chicken bits!! Oh yeah:)  SassiMissCassi,0.0,0.0
0," I was raised in the south and have been eating Chick-Fil-A since before I could talk. My favorite fast food place without a doubt!!!!  Food quality is good; employees always seem to love their job and if you eat inside you get table side service! What's not to love?  I have never had anything that wasn't good a CFA and they have some of the best milkshakes EVER!!! I highly recommend their summer special Banana Pudding filled with little bites of Nilla Wafers!  Super friendly location that is kept clean and food is always fresh and the play area will keep my almost 2 year old and 8 1/2 year old content!!

0," The Chipotle Chicken Burrito: Impossible Behemoth; or Bonding Experience? When one examines a Chipotle chicken burrito; one thing is plainly obvious: it's GARGANTUAN. Simply  thinking about eating the thing is enough to make your head spin. However; thankfully; there is a solution to this massively meaty treat; bring a friend along and share a meal!     Chipotle is set up as sort of the \Mexican\   Subway. Known for its savory burritos and salads; it is even more popular due to customer's ability to custom order their burrito. Don't like rice? Ditch it! Want extra salsa? You got it dude! (Thumbs up!) The possibilities are endless. You begin with rice; and then you have your choice of beans: baked; black; or refried. Next; they pile on the chicken with your choice of vegetables: peppers and onions; corn; lettuce; etc. And finally the sauces: salsas; sour cream; and guacamole. Make your combination and \  voila!\   it is ready for you. All for about 6-8 dollars!     But no matter how few or many ingredients you choose; inevitably; by the time your done; your burrito will simply be to copious  to comprehend. That's when you're buddy can join you. Not only will you enjoy a hearty meal with a good friend; but you'll have some money in your pocket left over for chips and salsa too! The atmosphere in Chipotle is very friendly and welcoming; the perfect place to stop by for lunch or dinner to have great food and conversation with a good friend. The décor is delightful; the aromas are mouth-watering; and the cacophony of conversations around is somewhat reminiscent of a cafeteria. As you take in your surroundings you feel at ease and a sense of comfort there. As you and your comrade share this blimp of a burrito; you'll have great fun wondering how someone came up with this perfection of flavors and spices!   ",0.0,1.0
0,OMG Burrito the size of my arm! This is a great location; and the staff is amazing.  Everyone is always so friendly and nice.  I love the cilantro lime rice Chipoltle offers; and when I want something filling but not *terribly* bad for me; this is a great option.  I usually get my order to go; and they are always super nice about adding extra layers of foil to keep my burrito at optimum munching temperature.   All I can really say is YAY BURRITOS!,1.0,1.0

When I am feeling extra crazy I order chocolate chip giant cookie.  All very delicious!! Not the cheapest but definitely worth it!!,1.0,0.0
0,What like about this place is the service.  Cold cut meats sliced as you order your sandwich and it goes right on your choice of bread.  The guy doing the slicing had an awesome customer service attitude; totally aggresive but also friendly.  The sandwiches were good.  If you need a quick bite for lunch I would say Mr. Goodcents is the way to go.  Don't expect anything too extravagant; its a sandwich....,1.0,1.0
0," I've been coming to Mr. Goodcents for a while and was interested in their 
ew\   toasted selections.  I ordered their California Turkey club; they took my name and disappeared to the back only to come back out and continue helping customers.  I figured it may take a minute or 2 so I let the customers behind me move ahead with their non-toasted selections.  Quite a bit of time passed and what had to be 10-15 minutes later a lady emerges from the back with my sandwich.  I got a \  sorry for the wait\   and took my sandwich to my table.  It was then I found out that the guacamole was left off; so all I had was a cheesy turkey sub.  I then had to go to 3 employees to get this guacamole; with another \  sorry\   to go with it.    Needless to say by the time this saga came to an end; the rest of my group was done eating and got to spectate as I ate my sandwich; as well as eating additional time off our lunch hour.  Pretty disappointing; maybe all sub shops aren't equipped for the toasted game.....or maybe they could have better communicated the ordeal that was to come.   ",0.0,0.0
0,Great place to go for a sub sandwich!  Meat & Cheese is sliced to order - no pre-packaged/pre-sliced crap!   Plenty of sandwich & topping choices!  Owner and all workers are always friendly & service is fast!  Penny Club; Italian; Buffalo Chix are some of my favorites - yet; all are good.  They also have a kids menu & pasta which my little one loves!  Stop in & enjoy!!,1.0,1.0
0,This place has been here forever.  One of the best sub places in the area.  Friendly staff and great pricing.  They shave the meat and cheese right in front of you so you know it is fresh.   Today I visited Mr. Goodcents and I ordered the Penny Sub without ham.  The sandwich maker added a couple extra pieces of roast beef and turkey to compensate.  The bread was soft and the overall sandwich was great as it normally is.  We seemed to get into the place just in time because the place filled up right after we sat down (I guess word could have gotten out that I came in.)    This place is leaps and bounds ahead of Subway so do yourself a favor and pick this place when you have your next hankerin'  for a tasty sandwich.,1.0,0.0

0,The night before we were to leave on vacation; we decided not to cook dinner. So; we thought of Chipotle on Shea. I used the Chipotle app on my iPhone to order two burritos.   Drove over and picked up our dinner and headed home. When my wife cut into her burrito; it wasn't what she ordered. I wasn't going to drive 13 miles to have it changed. She couldn't eat the rice and sour cream. She scraped all of that stuff off.  I called Chipotle and talked to the manager he was gracious enough to make up for the mistake the next time I showed up. I just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.  I love their food and the only reason why I'm giving them two stars is because 'I've experienced better' from them.  The next time I go there; I'll watch them make my meals.Forget about ordering on the phone.,0.0,0.0
0,Is every Chipotle the same? Is every prom date the same? NO!  This location is fantastic. The staff is fast; the food is fresh; and the restaurant is kept clean.   I've never been disappointed.   I'm not going to get into the nuances of what makes for a great meal at Chipotle; because they are quite prominent around town. The menu is simple; and you can pretty much order whatever you want; as long as they have the ingredients.  My only piece of advice for you is; when you walk in; turn left to get in line. Don't be a jackass like me and turn right. You'll see what I mean when you get there...,1.0,1.0

0," Getting to this particular location is half the battle. As other reviews have noted; it shares a parking lot with Best Buy; Buffalo Wild Wings; Chase Bank; Mellow Mushroom; Johnny Rocket and other locations... however Chipotle; despite being right next door to Best Buy with a lot front location has the longest walk to the door. Not to mention; regardless of where you park; you have to walk past a set of dumpsters.  This location does offer online ordering. That's a great thing these days for people on the go; however EVERY TIME I order online I end up waiting longer than if I were to just in line. Each online order I've placed has caused me to wait an additional 15 minutes on top of the half hour recommended wait by the website; I.E.: If I order at 5:00 the website will say \you're food will be ready for pick up at 5:30\  . When I arrive at 5:30 I find out my order hasn't even been looked at and the cashier has a look of shock on their face; and I don't get my food until 5:45. Instead of rushing my order; they put it through the line with the other people standing in line. At the longest; I've counted as many as 6 people going through the line while I waited for my online order. While the staff usually gives me a free drink to keep me calm I look at this as putting a band-aid on the situation while I'm standing there looking like a crazy person waiting on my food.  One time this happened and the manager actually ran out to me to in the parking lot and he was VERY apologetic. He gave me a coupon for a free taco/burrito/bowl to get me to come back. Well at much chagrin; I went back. This time I stood in line instead of ordering online so I could get out quicker. At the register I presented my \  free food\   coupon. The cashier looked at it and handed it back to me saying \  this is a buy one get one free coupon if you want we can make you another burrito so this will be legit.\   I looked over the coupon and no where on it could I see a \  buy one get one free\  . I showed the cashier and she stood her ground on it. I asked if her manager was available and she said; \  no; are you not going to pay because if you're not I'll need you to move so I can help the next customer.\   I left my food on the counter and passed the coupon on to a group of fire fighters standing in line.  Well; I went home and promptly e-mailed Chipotle's corporate headquarters and explained everything. Within 20 minutes I was in dialogue with the regional manager. She contacted the branch manager; the one who gave me the \  free\   coupon. He knew exactly who I was according to the regional manager. She personally sent me a stack of coupons for free food and forced the branch manager to train all the staff there on how to process the coupons and how to treat patrons.  Ok; so this time around I went in armed to the teeth in coupons and piss and vinegar. I went through the line. The tortilla guy; as usual rushed me through in a whirl of incoherent muttering about what I wanted on my three burritos. The meat and veggie guy didn't miss a beat on my orders. He saw the coupons and actually seemed stoked that I had them. I got to the cashier and he just looked pissed that I had them and took his sweet time processing them. Then charged me $6.24 for guacamole. Mike; the branch manager saw this as he was leaving his office and told the cashier to comp the guac because it just looked stupid to ring up 3 burritos and chips and salsa and drinks for free and then charge for guac.  So I recommend Chiptole for their food because it is good and  you get what want the way you want it. The service at this particular location; in stark contrast to their food; sucks. They are quick to argue with the customer when their manager is not present yet tuck their tales when he is around. If you have a coupon; prepare for battle. Do not bother ordering online. They will lose or forget your order and just make you wait longer. Going through the line is actually quicker regardless of how long the line is.   ",0.0,0.0

0,They say they open at 11 AM; but they were already roaring busy when I arrived at 11 today.  The service was friendly; & there are free; tasty peanuts in the shell to help yourself to; to hold you over while they fix your burger.  Their regular burger comes piled up to the sky with two meat patties & your choice of as many of the FIFTEEN add-ons that you want.  I ordered mine with mayo; lettuce; pickles; tomatoes; grilled mushrooms; ketchup; relish; & diced raw onions.  I also ordered a regular fries; Five Guys style.  While you munch on a few peanuts; FOURTEEN people run around behind the counter making your burger (while still others scurry around the in the nice dining area keeping everything in top shape)!  In a little while my order was ready.  It comes bagged up to go; with your MONSTER burger wrapped in aluminum foil; & the big order of fries way overflowing the cup it is served in.  I started on the fries first.  They come well browned; with peels on; & they're 5-Stars; straight up!  With its terrific tasting meat & everything else; this big boy beat even the Smokehouse Burger at Bobby-Q ($10) to become the best hamburger I've ever eaten!  I think it's absolutely worth the money:  (Double) Hamburger $5.09; Fries (plenty for 2 people) $2.59  (Enter the restaurant from near the corner of Washington Bv. & 1st Av.; arriving between 10:30 & 11 AM if you can; as by 11:30 this morning the line was WAY out the door!)     :-)),1.0,1.0

0,Tried this in Tempe but in a quick moment of haste I asked for the works and it came that way - my mistake as I hate ketchup and Mayo on burgers as it disguises the flavors and both were included; but that was my fault.  Vowed to try it again and when I did I omitted those offenders and it was great.  Came out promptly; result was good; tasty and far better than the competition (In-N-out ).  Mid priced burger was good value and the burger seemed of comparable caliber for price.  The meat was flavorful; the bun soft and they sported crisp veggies.  Order was exactly correct on delivery. A bit pricey; but not that bad overall.  Free peanut starters are a real plus as you wait - somebody was thinking on their toes for both client's hunger and preoccupation.   PS - Note on comments that compare this place to In-N-Out ; I do not consider them competition as I have seen In-N-Out as a filthy; dirty place where fries are scooped across the counter and back into the serving bin.  I searched on In 'N Out's website and it doesn't allow you to report it (like they don't care.  end of rant).,0.0,1.0
0," The location of this Five Guys was great; as it was right downtown amidst many other great places. The service was splendid. The food was good; it was better than a normal fast-food burger; but definitely not worth the price I paid for it. The cajun fries are great; you get well beyond the price you pay in fries. I got a \little fry\   that I was told \  feeds one person\  . I could have fed two guys off of those fries (and I can eat a lot of fries). I am so glad that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine! I have used this machine in another restaurant in Tennessee and became fascinated with it. You can pretty much make some crazy drink combinations; I had a Peach Mello Yello.   Overall; the food was great but not worth the price I paid. Would I go back? Sure; but not often. Would I recommend it to other people? Yes; but with an indication of the prices.   ",1.0,0.0
0," After a cool night of sampling drinks and treats at the very first Yelp Helps event at CityScape (downtown); I thought I finally try this place since it's so conveniently nearby.  Well; with mediocre expectations actually; I was not impressed with their BURGER.  I was really; really hoping that it would be better than this! Really! :)  I ordered their \Little\   cheese burger; which is a single patty burger.  I added my favorite toppings; mushrooms and onions; no extra cost (btw).  For sides; I ordered their Regular Cajun Fries that came in like a 16 oz. cup.  Excellent; seasoned very well and soft and tasted very; very POTATO-ee.  I would go back just for that.  The two problems to me were the BUNs and the PATTY.  If I didn't know any better; the buns were made of saw dust or card board! During the process of them compiling the burger; I did not see them toasting or buttering the buns like most places would.  The patty was not juicy or had that beefy flavor; I tasted mostly the DRY buns.  Same applied to my toppings; the mushrooms and onions. I felt the buns overrode everything!  Victory to the FRIES.

0," I had a hankering for a better burger than typical fast food; and Five Guys was in the neighborhood and worthy of a first time check out.  And it is; if you haven't been before.    But despite the rave restaurant reviews utterly plastered on almost every open space on the wall; this place is totally overrated.      The burger wasn't bad.  I dig all the fix-ins you can put on them; but it makes for a pretty messy eating experience.    Unfortunately; the burgers are way overpriced for what they really are--as another reviewer put it it; it really is a step up from Carl's Jr.    I ordered what should have been a \pretty big\   burger and it said I got two patties on the receipt; but in retrospect I think I got shorted cause the second one was much bigger.     Whatever the case; after two $6 burgers; I was still hungry.   That shouldn't happen in fast food places like this.  In-N-Out is twice the good deal this place is.      I did not try the fries... I thought I ordered them; but in fact did not because I didn't shout that I wanted fries.  Five Guys is annoyingly loud.   Some day I will understand the onslaught of overplayed classic rock played in practically every eating establishment these days.  It's getting annoying; especially when it causes order fuckups.   The service was quick and really friendly.   And I like the free peanuts.   It makes me think my two-star rating is a little low; but the soda machine tasted like soap and some bedraggled man took his sweet time in the *one* bathroom they had available.      And ultimately; it is an expensive burger that would have been forgettable if I didn't have a particular fondness for A-1 sauce and 'shrooms.  I could only see myself going again if I were stuck on the corner; needed to eat quick; already ate at Chipotle's; and had some money to burn; all of which are a stretch for me; but probably not  the upper middle-classed downtown lunch crowd.     And that lunch crowd must be exactly this place's target market--with all of the above being said; you're probably not going to find a better; quicker burger within a short walk from the Washington St office towers.  The plethora of fast convenience stores on the ground floor of Block 77; brought to us by CityScape's cynical over-commercialism; is not without its utility to some people.    For anybody else; I wouldn't bother a second time.    3/10.   ",1.0,1.0
0," I don't get to Five Guys as often as I should; mainly because they started out my way on the east coast and are pretty much everywhere.  So I basically ended up with a case of burnout.  But since it was National Cheeseburger Day; and we were on a tight schedule for lunch; we decided to stop in since it was only a block or so from our hotel.  The thing to realize about Five Guys is that a \little\   cheeseburger is actually a normal-sized burger anywhere else.  A regular burger there is actually two patties.  So from there I went with a little bacon cheeseburger; with all of the fixings.  And I immediately realized my mistake in overlooking how good Five Guys is.  It was just a delicious burger; perfectly moist; and bursting with flavor.  Hotdogs have always seemed to be a weak spot and that was still the case at this location.  For as complex and delicious as the burgers are; the dogs are always plain and one note.  Even loading them up with toppings doesn't help.  Note that an order of fries is a massive portion.  You can choose between regular or cajun; but either way you'll have your fill of carbs for about a week.  But don't make my mistake and overlook FG.   ",0.0,0.0
0," This In-N-Out wannabe is not worth the money.  No specials so you have to buy the burger; fries and drink separtely.  Food was not worth the $12 you end up paying.  They DO give you a lot of fries; but quantity is not worth the quality...greasy and soggy.   They also don't tell you their burger is a double burger.  That would've been nice to know and I would've ordered a \little burger\  . Will NEVER go back.   ",0.0,0.0
0,Sadly the burger tastes a lot like Fuddruckers burgers.  Not that this is bad; it just seems like there is too much sauce going on.  Part of the problem is that you get to build your own burger and I tend to go overboard.  It is a very limited menu; the burgers come in various sizes and the fries come by the bagful.  The fries are delicious.  The lines can get really long in this location but you can order ahead on-line.  Overall; it's a good burger; but I'm not sure its worth the calories.,0.0,0.0
0,I'm a vegetarian so I don't come here often but when I do I always order either a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and fresh jalapeños ; and it is always good...the cashiers are always friendly; and the wait is usually minimal...everything is pretty organized. Occasionally I will get fries but they are very filling and too greasy for frequent consumption. My only complaint is really the size of the grilled cheese sandwich. It's very small compared to the size of a veggie sandwich (with more veggies; roughly the same price) at Jimmy Johns next door,1.0,0.0
0,Take Five Guys for exactly what it is and it earns all 5 stars in my book. Despite what other reviewers think; THIS IS A FAST FOOD CHAIN! They just happen to use FRESH; quality ingredients instead of the crap you find at McDonald's or BK! You wanna compare it to something? Try In-and-Out. Which I also love. But being an East Coaster; my allegiance lies with Five Guys.   I love the Bacon Cheeseburger with fresh cut jalapenos and grilled mushrooms; accompanied by the cajun fries!! YES; the regular burger comes with 2 patties! If that's too much for you to eat then order the Little Burger. Or eat as much of the Regular as you can and throw the rest out. It's not something to whine about on Yelp and deduct stars for. The same goes for the fries... yes they give you a lot... why is that a bad thing?  If you're looking for a fresher version of a fast food burger with plenty of FREE toppings to choose from; then Five Guys is right up your alley!,0.0,0.0

0,Oh the butterburgers and the concretes. Got to love the frozen custard concretes. That you can mix in any two things you want from there list of many. Inside tip: They also have chocolate custard not just vanilla. This I found out after a few visits. I always get chocolate custard with chocolate sauce and Oreo cookies. I think its the best. The burgers are really good. So are the onion rings and the cheese curds. I have never heard of cheese curds before Culvers. Must be a Wisconsin thing but they are really good. To call them fried cheese balls don't do them justice. Just try them. If you like cheese you will like these. The service is pretty good. Sure it takes awhile to get your food but that just means they are making it fresh. For that I am willing to wait. Plus they give you your concrete first so you can enjoy that while you pull forward in the drive thru to wait for the rest of your order. They give you a number and then bring out your food right to your car. It is a little expensive to eat more than once a week but it is well worth it.,0.0,0.0
0,I grew up with Culvers in the Midwest so I was happy to find this location nearby in Chandler. While I have always had a pretty good experience here customer service wise even during the lunch rush the food has always been only so so. The burgers lately have been really bland which is not the culvers that I remember from back home. The buffalo chicken fingers are really tasty along with the onion rings but lately leaving Culvers I feel unsatisfied. I will give Culvers another shot but I hope the flavor of the burgers improves a bit. So far it's just meh...,1.0,1.0
0,Their food is pretty darn good!  Everything I have ordered there has been perfectly made so far.  I've stuck to getting the double cheeseburger combo; and Culver's has been consistent so far.    The cheese curds are a perfect side.    People might complain a little about the prices; but I'm pretty sure the prices at Culver's are still cheaper that a place like Carl's Jr.'s.

0,I SO wanted to like Culver's. After finishing up an evening meeting we walked over to have dinner. We placed our order quickly and then went to fill our drinks. I know it was just after the rush hour but the drink station was a mess. There was liquid all over the place and straw paper wrappers everywhere.   The food was just so-so. I had a sour dough burger. The bread was mushy and the burger tasteless. Did not like the cheese curds at all. My husband had the fish and he said it was average. For what it cost; I'd rather go elsewhere.

0,WOW!! I have NEVER received such excellent customer service!! After learning of my not so pleasant experience at his store; Jason the store owner contacted me right away. He was extremely pleasant and apologized. He offered to send me certificates for my next visit but then I got a phone call from him and he had left a basket on my porch filled with goodies and a lot of gift certificates. We live out in San Tan Valley so it's a good 45 minutes from his store. He drove all the way out here to personally deliver the basket. Unfortunately the sign fell off my door bell that it's out of order so I was not able to meet him in person. But I will be going back to this Chandler location for sure. He is an owner who takes customer service to a whole new level and truly appreciates each and everyone of his customers. He did tell me that this is his lively hood so he takes it very seriously. Wow; he definitely does! He has talked to all of his staff and I believe that day was just one of those off days; perhaps even on my part. Thank you Jason for really caring!  I had to edit because I was so shocked by the owner's customer service that I forgot to mention how great the food is. The food is what got me hooked on Culvers to begin with. All the menu items I've tried have been really good but my favorite is the sour dough melt; it has grilled red onions in the burger patty. The root beer float is the best ever!! The custard is delicous and the mint flavor is perfect. A nice surprise is their lemon ice. The ice is shaved like fresh snow and the lemon flavor is perfect. My daughters love it with strawberry topping. A nice healthier alternative to the custard.,1.0,1.0

0,Coming from Atlanta where Chick-Fil-A is almost as popular as Waffle House; I have to admit; I'm a fan... but the main reason I like Chick-Fil-A?  Their diet lemonade!

0," Let me start by saying that I don't go to fast food restaurants. Like; at all. This is purely the effect of my current San Francisco metropolitan lifestyle; as cliche as that may be.  However; a few coworkers insisted that I at least try this fine establishment. So to cross an item off my fast-food bucket list; I caved. (Still haven't been to Wendy's and Jack-in-the-Box; fingers crossed...).  The food was exactly as you'd expect; a giant menu of chicken--fried and grilled and every way you can imagine. That is a positive thing though; because I'm usually underwhelmed by the quality of fast food when compared to their own pictures on the menu.  Brownie points for the great service (I'm told they have to say \my pleasure\   when thanked for their service) and the fact that they use all-breast meat and peanut oil to make their nuggety deliciousness.  Chick-Fil-A might just be one of the few fast food restaurants that deserve a 4+ rating.  -----  Distinguishing factor: A genuine fast food joint that is truer to their image than their counterparts.

0,I decided to try Pei Wei after having not eaten there for a couple years since their menu never seemed very healthy.  They recently changed some of their options so I ordered a few takeout dishes for my family; all steamed chicken or shrimp. They tasted ok; but what really spoiled the experience was my wife's Chinese chopped chicken salad. About 3/4 through the meal she stopped eating; disgusted by the insect among her salad which was still ALIVE.  I contacted the manager (Cory or Cody; I believe) and he only offered a quick apology and to make us a different dish if we drove back to the restaurant. I told him we were too far away and he should check the rest of their salad for similar insects (see the pictures I included with this review). He didn't seem too concerned. Furthermore; my voicemail messages to Pei Wei corporate customer relations have not been returned. This Pei Wei location is definitely a lower tier; fast food version of PF Chang's.  I'd avoid it and go to Panda Express nearby instead. At least there you can see what goes on your plate before you eat it.,0.0,1.0

0,I visited Pei Wei for the first time last Sunday.  We told the cashier it was our first time visiting and she was very helpful. I loved the fountain drink machine.  The carbonation was good and they have pretty much any kind of soda you could want; including some I didn't even know existed. I ordered a combo plate which was a smaller portion and included a starter.  I went with the Hot and Sour soup which is normally a favorite of mine; and we started with some Crab Wontons. The flavor of the soup was good; but the consistency was much too thick for my palette; almost like a gravy vs a soup.  I would not order it again. The crab wontons were good; had a lot of crab flavor and were presented sitting in a chili type of sweet and sour sauce.  I enjoyed them but some people might now like the wontons swimming in that sauce. My mongolian beef was delicious; and my boyfriend ordered a thai coconut chicken which also had a great flavor.   With the exception of the soup; all the rest of our food was fresh and very flavorful.  I also felt that the value for the money was superb.  I will definitely be going back there.,0.0,0.0
0,I haven't been to Pei Wei in a couple years and it sounded good. We came during the lunch rush and it was crazy!  After 20 minutes in line we were able to order our food. The woman behind the counter could hardly hear us. I felt like I was screaming my order at her. After placing our order we found a place to sit down. With how busy it was the tables were being cleared very fast which was nice.  The food took quite awhile to come out and after standing in line for so long I was about to eat the silverware and napkins sitting in front of me.   If you want to have a conversation during your meal I suggest you bring an old fashioned ear trumpet horn so your companion can shout into one end and you can listen on the other end. It was LOUD in there.   I ordered the Mongolian Steak with brown rice. I really liked the brown rice. The meat was a little chewy and heavy on the sauce.   Overall I would like to try more items off their menu; however I think I will call ahead and pick up.,0.0,0.0
0," Who needs to \yelp\   Pei Wei; right?  Right.  However; this review is about this particular location.  I work right down the street and have experienced this store so many different ways now that I had to write a review.  Our company has pre-ordered off of the catering menu here; a large and complicated order - but everything was perfect.  I've come into this store with \  free meal\   coupons; pre-ordered online and picked up food; etc.; and received professional; friendly; really outstanding service every time.  How many other restaurants call you to see how your order was today?  I find their staff very sharp and helpful.  Yes; they do get extremely busy at this location; but I have yet to see any staff members look frazzled or unprepared.  They are really on top of it here.  This is a five star Pei Wei; if that makes sense. :)   ",1.0,1.0

0,We've been here a few times for an early lunch or an early dinner before heading to a movie. Decent location for the chain with the typical offerings. The parking lot here can be a little tricky with it being inside of a fairly busy complex - so I recommend coming here at off times instead of trying to be a part of the lunch rush.   The staff is always friendly and the food comes out hot and as ordered each time. They seem to be able to keep up with the rushes by keeping the tables clean and ready for the next guest; which is always nice. A fair number of people seem to get to-go from here; which may be due to all of the local businesses in the area and people wanting to take their meals back to the office; which means that there are almost always seats available in the main area; despite the number of cars outside.    Definitely a place we'll hit up again for a quick bite.,1.0,1.0
0,This particular location is pretty busy most of the time.  It is located within a shopping complex that in itself is busy regularly as well.  We stopped here for dinner before seeing a movie in the area; and although there was a line; it moved pretty quickly.  I had the Mongolian Beef - which is my typical order when we come here.  We also tried out the pot stickers; which were not as good as the ones at PF Changs.  Probably wouldn't order those again; but the spring rolls are a good substitute. The beef was cooked well and we enjoyed the extra sauce the server brought over to us.  Overall: B+ Busy location; but with friendly staff and pretty quick food service it's not a bad stop off.,1.0,1.0
0," When I moved to Phoenix; Pei Wei was one of the first restaurants I went to and one of my go to places for Asian food. However; over the past 7 years; I have found other places I enjoy and would rather dine at. The food is standard and tastes good; but it isn't fantastic. I like that they are doing lunch specials now; so that helps since the portions can be exceedingly large and not great the next day. This location opened up close to work; so it's easily accessible; which is a plus. We came here a few weeks after the grand opening; but it seemed that all the kinks weren't worked out. While waiting in line; there was only one gal on the register and she was ignoring us in favor of folks who just walked in for Take Away. Finally; a Take Away Customer said to her \Aren't you going to help them? They were here first.\   She glanced at us; then back to the customer and shook her head no before sighing and finally asking us for our order. Not sure what that was about; but I think they need more employees on the registers; especially at lunch time.   ",0.0,1.0

0,I saw a line out the door when I was on my way home from work the other day; so I figured it must be a great place.  I checked out the menu online and decided I wanted to take my parents over there to try it.   Now my dad loves Italian beef sandwiches; so i usually take him to Luke's across the freeway.  So sorry to Luke's for trying something new.  We got there about 11:30 am; just right before the lunch rush but looks like that started pretty early.  The outdoor patio was full with customers and the line inside was pretty long.  Now let me tell you that I've never seen so many people working in a restaurant before but it was definitely needed!   The first thing you have to do is get in line to order your food.  Keep in mind that if you want salads; you would need to go to two different areas to pick up your food.  But like I said; there are lots or people working that its pretty quick for the order coming out.  Finding a table was no that big of a problem; so I had the Asian chicken salad and my dad had the Italian beef.  My mom and nephew had the Chicago style hot dogs.  The salad was very good and a good portion and i took a bite of the Italian beef and it was awesome.  You have a choice of having your Italian beef sandwich dipped in Au jous to make the meal more juicy which is what i recommend.   The place is very good but is you want to avoid the lunch crowd; come after 12:30pm; that's when the crowds kinda lighten up.,0.0,0.0
0,Although I'm no Chicago native; I've been there and can say that this place doesn't do Chicago dogs justice. We ordered the jumbo chili cheese dog; Italian beef; fries; and a burger. Everything just tasted okay. The Italian beef was the one item that was pretty decent.,0.0,0.0
0,Being from Chicago I was waiting for this place to open!  Still love it!  Gotta get the italian beef with lots and lots of hot peppers!  They have yummy crinkle fries if I remember correctly.  I also order some gravy on the side. (basically its au jus the beef is cooked in).  So delicious!  Now that they have been open a while its not as packed as when it first opened.,0.0,0.0
0,Ok so maybe I dont get why they had 4 attendants ( people) threw the drive threw area one asking order; even when they had a drive up menu / with speaker box  and there where 2 of those; one handling money -- even this freaks me out a bit espic hoping the right change is handled properly; and 4 was at drive threw window. TO me that seems like a wasted staff amount probably could be used inside rather then outside. Took about 7 mins for order big meat - Italian Beef sand. The meat and auju was great bread was lacking it. The onion rings could tell they where fresh however a little bland we where in drive threw and not presented our drink while waiting for our food. I dont mind waiting espic if I have a drink to chill out too but to me that was interesting. I do not understand concept of having to stop and talk to people I would rather pull too the menu board and order that way. If there triing to be like sonic ? It was a friday however I still do not understand why so many steps and still left a little confused. I rather run into chompies.,0.0,0.0

0," Pretty great food. It's really just popular for being the chain it is. It's a little chaotic and always full; but it's a great experience. I've tried quite a few of the items and been here multiple times; so here are my reviews for them. Chili cheese hotdog: Great! Chock full of cheese; chili; and onions. The hotdogs are great quality and the buns are soft; and delicious. Make sure to get the jumbo size! Definitley a lot bigger; but not too much more expensive.  Regular Hotdog: Just okay. I guess I'm not fans of any chicago dogs; but on the bright side; the thing was very full!  Italian Beef: MMMM!! What can I even say? The first bite was a little weird; but as I kept eating; it got more and more amazing!! The beef is perfectly cooked; and almost buttery tasting; and has a little kick of heat. THe flavor is seriously amazing; and bread compliments it perfectly. And for those who complain it's soggy; it's dipped in the juices! If you don't like it; ask for it \Dry\     Cheese Fries: The fries are quite generic; but they're cooked perfectly crispy; and the inside is very soft. The cheese; as always; is great.  Burgers: They're pretty great. But why would you order a burger at Portillos? Good; but not recommended unless you're not a fan of anything else here.  Chopped Salad: Pretty good. But still; not worth it.  It has a very unique flavor and a nice sweet tang. Probably not worth getting again.  Chocolate cake shake: Just okay; great for chocolate lovers; but too sweet in my taste.  Overall; if you're a hotdog fan and looking for a great hotdog in the valley; this is defintley recommended. I also recommend the italian beef. One thing about this place is that it can add up to be a bit pricey if you order a few things.   ",0.0,0.0

0,As a Chicago native; I'm reviewing with that standard in mind. While not bad; this place does fall short a bit. My usual order (for years) has been a hotdog with no tomato and no pepper; a bowl of chili; and fries.  Moving out to AZ; I was sad that I'd only get my Portillo's fix when I flew back to visit family. So when one opened in Scottsdale; I was all over it.  I've been quite a few times at this point.   Hot dog - pretty much as expected. Hasn't let me down.  Chili - gross. I seriously don't know what happened; but it's thicker somehow and lacking something. I tested on my last trip to IL; and it hadn't changed there. It's just bad here.  Fries - hard to mess up. My go-to side.  Onion rings - gross. Super hard; oddly sweet; nothing special.   I use to love the strawberry smoothie; but that's not served here. I did try the chocolate cake shake for the very first time a few days ago and was mightily impressed. I'd never had it before; so I can't compare to IL. While it falls short in a few things; my kids and I have made this our after-zoo spot.   Question though...when on earth did the relish turn neon green? I'm certain it wasn't that color before...?,0.0,0.0
0,Having grown up in Chicago; I have very fond memories of Portillo's. Perhaps Portillo's changed since branching out or perhaps my memory distorts the truth. Going to Portillo's in Scottsdale was like watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as an adult--I don't know what I ever saw in this.  To begin; I visited twice: once during peak hours and once in between the lunch and dinner rush. During peak hours; the wait was long; I was scolded for taking a picture inside; the order was incorrect; and the burgers were similar in quality to Wendy's. The second visit wasn't much better. I entered the drive through to see more attendants than cars and waited 15 minutes for a cheeseburger with only one car ahead of me. Upon arriving home; the fries were only half full; the soda was mostly ice; and the burger was a soggy mess of mayo and ketchup. I took three bites of the burger and tossed it in the trash.  The food doesn't live up to the hype or the price. I will not be returning.,0.0,1.0
0,I was a bit sad since I used to frequent the Uncle Sam's that was here; but all my regrets are definitely gone. Portillo's is a sick joint and I hope it's here to stay.  Taking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant. Akin to something like Five Guys; you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter. They even have a separate counter for serving desserts.   The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction; but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me; the Italian beef attracts the most customers. The gravy is excellent; and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves. The bread does the sandwich justice; but it's good but not great. I personally like the combo; which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beef.  The sides are not something to shirk at either. The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz.   To top everything off; this entire restaurant even has a drive thru; which totally works!  The menu is huge; so I'm far from exhausting my limit here. I hear the salads are pretty good; and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually. However; it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back.,0.0,0.0
0,I'm a big fan of Portillos; but lately they seem to be slipping; perhaps the heat is doing it.  I went through the drive thru.  So I order a garbage salad.  I get home.  The Salad is a little bit wilted. The leaves have a high number of thick stocks.  I order an extra poppy seed muffin because I love them and they charged me for it; but they gave me only one.  I look for a straw for my drink and there wasn't any. So you folks at Portillos need to get your ordering and delivery system back in shape.,0.0,0.0

The staff is very well organized and despite going back at night; we waited a very short amount of time for our food.  Well...Maybe I'm not such a devoted fan after all...Last time I went thru the drive thru; they screwed up my order. I called them to let them know - and the manager said he would send me a certificate...well; I never got anything...so they're full of it...but I still like them no matter what...I don't feel like crying because the sausage was missing in action...,1.0,1.0

0,Well; I've been a few times and it's been pretty good. I love their hot dogs; aside from the fact that their mustard is bland and the only reason you know it's mustard is because it's yellow... But the reason I'm writing is that one of my coworkers and my boss just went and got salads. My boss got the wonton chicken salad without the wontons; not that bad I know; but this was 1/2 an hour after my coworker got a grilled chicken salad with no chicken and no side muffin. Adding this to my own experiences where the Italian Beef was really bland (and yes; I got the peppers and gravy so it was soggy; slimy and bland) and when I ordered cheese fries the cheese was all over the inside of the bag and not in the container; well; I think I'll stick with driving a ways to Uncle Sam's.,0.0,0.0

0,I actually go to Portillo's a couple of times a month but not because the food is so great; or the atmosphere; or even the price.  It's simply convenient -- close to home and you get your food quickly since you order at a register and then pick it up at the counter.  Ambiance is zero inside; and the outside patio features car fumes.  The roast beef sandwich is probably their best item.  The rest - average.  The fries; sweet potato fries; and onion rings are all just ok or maybe a bit less.  The hot dogs are fine; but try making them Sonora style and you might have something.  If you are passing buy and are hungry and are willing to spend about $10 for a sandwich and fries; Portillo's will do.,1.0,0.0

Ton's of tables; and lots of people helping.  The lines here were long; but I didn't spend more then 15 minutes between the time I stood in line and got my food.  they have two lines here. One for ordering; one for food pickup.  They had all 4 registers open; with girls throughout the line taking your order and writing it down for you to make things go quicker.  Once I got to the register; things went fine.  They sent me over to the pickup line where you grab your drinks and food.  That was the longer line of the two; and you kind of stand around in this clustered area waiting for your number to be called.  Being that this place was packed; there was an enormous amount of people waiting; but it seemed to go by quickly.  I found a seat near the door; and the food was awesome!  I got the jumbo hot dog with relish; mustard and onions with a pickle on the side. Bun was tasty; and I loved it. Price point was right on; and I will gladly drive the few extra miles to go here in the future.  If you haven't gone to Portillo's; you must do so!! Tasty!!  They also have a drive thru here; so if you want to avoid the crowds; or are in a hurry; this is the way to go.  Outdoor seating is available; along with ample parking in a very busy shopping center.

0,I've never had an Italian beef before my visit to Portillo's. I lived by one in California but I never tried it because I thought it was just hot dogs; but when I saw some of the pictures of the beef sandwiches and read the reviews; I was eager to give it a try. Since this location is right by my work; I finally had a convenient opportunity to give it a shot. We went through the drive-thru and service was crazy on point! It wasn't incredibly busy like I had seen passing by other times; so maybe the 7 staff members standing outside to take orders usually have more to do; but it seemed way overstaffed at that point. The food came out reasonably fast and you could feel the heat of the sandwich intensely through the bag. We decided to share a big beef sandwich; dipped (we love gravy) and with hot peppers; with a side of fries. The sandwich was so juicy it leaked through the bag; so next time ill probably ask them to double bag/wrap it! When we got home we devoured the entire meal with great satisfaction. The sandwich was huge; easily satisfying our hunger. Can't wait to have another; and maybe try a Chicago Style dog; I'm interested in what all the hype is about!,0.0,0.0
0," \Hot Dog\   is in the name and I am only going to Review the Hot Dogs.  Here I am going to \  go against the grain\   with a mediocre Review of a New Restaurant receiving mostly good Reviews.  Okay; so maybe I am a \  Hot Dog Snob\   from the East Coast; where everyone knows there is only one brand of Hot Dog that can stand up to being boiled instead of grilled. (The \  Dirty Water Dog\   is the Sabrett brand; in Natural Casing).  In fairness to this new location and because I love Hot Dogs I tried three varieties:                          With everything! (The Chicago way)                          With Mustard and Relish only (My favorite)                           Chile Cheese Dog  Let me say; the \  Toppings\   are terrific. The problem is with the Hot Dog itself. Far too mild; no beefy taste (Bordering on no taste); overwhelmed by the toppings and with very little \  snap\   when biting into it.  Probably in the minority; but just NOT as good as the size of the Restaurant and the reputation would indicate.  Ted's is still the \  Hot Dog Of Choice\   in Phoenix and they are from Buffalo; New York.   Willing to venture to Maricopa for the BEST BOILED HOT DOGS EVER (Sabrett)? If so; go to Al's Dogs located next to O'Reilly Auto Parts on John Wayne in Maricopa. Better call first to be certain they are open: (520) 357-3647   ",0.0,0.0

Some go for cheese; but honestly I think that just takes away from the amazingness of the beef itself.  I guess I'm pretty simple.   A helpful tip to avoid the crazy crowd:  go right when they open!  That's what we did and it was easy breezy and quiet.  Late reakfast\   or an early lunch - if you don't want to wait it out in the long lines; get there as early as possible.  We got there at 11am and it was getting pretty crowded by 11:30. It's worth it.  Having a Portillo's here means one less thing on my To-Do list when I go home to visit! Love it!   ",0.0,0.0
0,I've been here twice and will return.  I've only had the hotdogs; so I can't speak to the remaining menu.  The hotdog I had was really good!  I very seldom eat meat; but was craving a good 'ole fashioned hotdog and Portillo's did the trick! It's a busy; chaotic atmosphere; but the service is really fast.  Parking is sometimes a challenge as it's located in a huge shopping area; be careful.......some people aren't very pedestrian aware!,1.0,1.0
0,We're from Chicago and have lived in the valley for over 41 years. During that time we've tried many places to get a good Chicago Italian Beef sandwich. None of them had the right texture; seasoning; moisture to be called a Chicago style sandwich. Today we visited Portillo's and are so happy we did.  We had their Italian Beef sandwich and it was like being back in Chicago. We LOVED it. My husband liked it so much he ordered the Big Beef sandwich to go and had it later this evening at home.  One of their salads made my mouth water so next time I'm going to try that. It's an apple walnut chicken salad. The place is large; airy; a little on the noisy side; quick service; plenty of space and an outside patio. We will be back and I'm sure it'll be multiple times.,0.0,0.0
0,A friend and I ran a 5k last night so we decided to indulge in Portillo's for dinner. We made out way over and while it looked busy; there wasn't a long wait to order or pick up our food. I decided to try the beef n cheddar and fries and my friend had a chili dog. Our food was ready after not too long and we grabbed a table and dug in. Unfortunately; the fries and lemonade far outshone the sandwich. It looked and tasted as though it had been preprepared and was sitting in a warmer. It was warm; not hot; and there was little cheddar to be found. My friend was equally unimpressed with his hot dog. For the price though; it wasn't a total rip off. On our way out; I grabbed a chocolate cake shake and he got a strawberry shortcake. Those definitely redeemed our experience and I loved the shake.   Maybe they are experiencing a lack of quality control in the kitchen since opening up? I'll probably try the Tempe location once it opens up but I was less than impressed with my first time here.,0.0,1.0
0,There was so much hype about this place that the bar was set super high; but my first visit was terrible. Had never been here before so my girlfriend and I were standing beyond where the line was looking at the menu. An 'usher'; or whatever they are; jettisoned us (rather rudely also I must say) into the line saying we have to get in line; despite our remarks that we had never been here and didnt know what to order. He insisted so we got in line and within 30 seconds were pushed to the counter. We still had almost no time to look at the menu and we let the employee know that we were pushed through and we weren't ready and then he got frustrated with us. Felt like I was in the twilight zone. Hot dogs are sub-par and disappointing. Luke's of chicago was way better in my opinion. Not allowed to sit at a table and wait unless you have food; must clean up your own plates and throw everything away your self. Not really much a restaurant format. Wonder exactly what I am paying for here; average food and attitude it seems. Gave them 2 more tries and results were similar. Not coming back here.,0.0,0.0
0,If you like burgers that taste like they just came off of dad's backyard grill; then this is the place to go. Never have I found in a restaurant a burger that tasted so similar; but I found it here. And that's the only way I can describe it; really. I can't even remember how the rest of my food tasted; I was so enthralled with the deliciousness of my burger that anything else in front of me was irrelevant. They have a completely separate counter for ordering desserts; so try not to fill up like I did so you can experience that!  My roommate is a Chicago native so as soon as she caught wind of this place we immediately headed over for her to relive memories of her childhood. The place was unbelievably packed - the line was consistently out the door and winding around the dining area - but it was worth the wait. In fact; I have yet to drive by when they aren't seriously busy; but perhaps that is a testament to their food. For the line being so long; it didn't take too long. The decor is retro styled and set up like classic diner-meets-backyard picnic and suited the food they serve there well.,1.0,0.0
0,Starting with the food; it tastes great and I'll go back for it.    That said; I usually order take-out from my car; and way too often they don't get the order right. Today; I ordered a large iced tea with the pink equal; I got neither equal nor a straw. I ordered mustard on my Maxwell Street Polish; missing!  On other occasions; I've ordered the burger with mustard; ketchup; pickle; onion only and gotten lettuce; tomato and mayo; or no onion; or no pickle.  If this kind of sloppy service didn't happen about every other time I go there; I would give them 4 stars.  Come on Portillo's; get your act together!,0.0,1.0

0,I really don't understand what all the hooplaa (a teynical term) is about. We stopped in for a quick lunch with the parents last week and we were less than impressed. We enjoyed what we ordered; but I wouldn't drive more than 5 minutes to eat there.   I had a chopped salad; it was alright; the dressing was good; but too much of it. My hotdog bun was pretty much wet. Everyone said the was because it had been in a steamer or something... if this is what people in Chicago call a good hot dog; they must not get good food often. I guess the Italian Beef is what all the rage was about; but none of us partook in any of the beef sandwiches; maybe we will give it a whirl next time.   I also don't get the drive through right next to the patio like that..... yeah that's just what I want with my sandwich a lung full of exhaust fumes. Awesome!  All in all it was alright foo.... but I wouldn't go out of my way.,0.0,0.0
0,Awesome food and service when there. The staff was very polite; and despite the place being packed on a Sat afternoon; they kept lines moving; and allowed people to get their food quickly.  The Italian Beef def fit the Chicago mold; and was well crafted and flavored. The employees cannot be praised enough for their care of the product and the food.  If you actually care about food; and appreciate quality; and especially if you are from Chicago; Portillo's is a must,1.0,1.0
0,Was excited about the hot dog experience considering the reviews however the hot dogs were below average. We ordered the signature original hot dog and it was not good; I much prefer the Costco hot dog hands down. The only reason I would even consider going back is because their onion rings were phenomenal. One of the best I've ever had. Chili fries were also decent. However considering they specialize in hot dogs; I think they are in no comparison to what I'm used to back home (Seattle).,0.0,0.0
0," Cue Gershwin's \Rhapsody in Blue\  ; because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!  For most Chicago food lovers; Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes; there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply; the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.  This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night; it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me; there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.    As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside; and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy; satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.  I was ordering for three; since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself; I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy; did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck; I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me.   Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half; was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good; but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait; everything was delicious.  The other items on my family's order; were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each; another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09); along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95; including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said; I goofed and over ordered by a mile!  Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95; or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19; and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different; they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.  In Yelp-ese; a Four Star experience is \  Yay! I'm a fan.\    A Five Star is \  Woohoo! As good as it gets!\    Before tonight; I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon; they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.  Enjoy!   ",0.0,0.0

0,This is the place to take people who claim to dislike hot dogs.  It is impossible to dislike a Portillo's hot dog.

0,Ahhh! I'm addicted to Chick-Fil-A!!!  I finally tried this place after hearing so many good things and I'm hooked. The first week I tried it.. I think I had it 4 times. haha. (Kinda embarrassing to say :X)   I usually get the spicy chicken sandwich with all the fixin's and eat it with chick fil a sauce and buffalo. mmmmmm. The chicken is a huge piece and it's fried perfect! (Actually one time; it was way overdone. I let them know and they immediately cooked me a fresh one. I hope it didn't have spit in it; although they are so friendly and nice I doubt they would do something like that... or would they?)  The crisscut fries are soooo good. You can tell the oil they fry it in is fresh. They give you great service; it's clean and nice; they give you great extras; and they have community family events. Just feels like a wholesome place to be. :),1.0,1.0
0," Excuse me; I didn't order this \doggie bag.\    I'd always been a fan of Chick-Fil-A.  That is; until my recent visit.  I placed a drive thru order and waited my turn in line behind another vehicle ahead of me.  That vehicle had it's windows rolled down and two (cute!) dogs were in the back seat with their snouts peering out the window.  It seems the drive thru attendant couldn't resist their charms; reached out and allowed at least one of the dogs to lick the palm of her hand; undoubtedly smearing saliva.  When my turn at the window arrived; I was certain the drive thru attendant would first wash her hands before serving me; but that never occurred.  Please don't misunderstand.  I; myself; am a pet owner and love my furry friend.  In my own home I am always sure to wash my hands before touching food; utensils; kitchen surfaces; etc.  I was dumbfounded when I was expected to pay someone else for something I would not allow myself to do.  In the interest of full disclosure; the drive thru attendant did not prepare my food; but she did handle the packaging it came in which; in turn; I also needed to handle to have access to the food.  All I could think about was cross contamination.  Had I not been in a hurry; I would have brought this to the manager's attention instead of throwing away food which may have been very good under other circumstances.   ",0.0,1.0

A look to the rear view and then to my front. \  What the hell?\    The girl in the drive thru window is literally leaning her head out the window; dangling my bag of chow in her hand as to say; \  Come on Big Guy; you can do it!\   I crap you negative; the drive thru took about 120 secs from green-to-checkered flag on a busy Friday at lunchtime.

0," Jersey Mike's is; in my opinion; as good as it gets.  Yes; they have the whole \it all started in 1956 as a family business at the Jersey Shore\   thing going for it (you know; before MTV and a half-dozen wannabe D-Listers made anything connected to the Jersey Shore look bad); and they also do a lot for charity; both at the corporate level; and a little closer to home; on the franchise level.  And all that's well and good; but it wouldn't mean anything if the food sucked; right?  No worries there- I've not had a bad sandwich there.  The bread is fresh; as are all of the other ingredients; and it's all sliced fresh when you order it.  It's not like Subway; where they put a slice of meat and a slice of cheese on the sandwiches; they pile it on.  Cold subs; hot subs; wraps- I've enjoyed all of the sandwiches I've tried- not something I can say about some other sandwich shops I've been to.  If I had to pick a couple of favorites; I'd say the #6 (Roast Beef) and the Chicken Caesar wrap.  One nit to pick- I with there were a 3/4 size; sometimes the 'regular' isn't big enough; but the 'giant' is too big.  The parking at this particular location can be a bit challenging at times because it's small and a little tight; but the sandwiches are worth it.  And the Starbucks next door usually has marble loaf in their display case!   ",0.0,0.0

0,I usually go just for the salad bar which I think is totally worth it. I decided to order a sandwich and was completely disappointed because it was soaked and soggie. It was a hot sandwich so it probably sat on the plate for a while before they sent it to our table.,0.0,1.0
0,My 21 year old grandson who lives with my wife & I along with My 14 year old grandson who spent the night while my wife is in the hospital for a knee replacement. After leaving the hospital around 7pm we stopped at In-N-Out Burger for a quick dinner. I normally detest fast food; but I don't even think In-N-Out truly belongs in that category.  A lot of people would say In-N-Out is overrated but they are good. They have a very limited menu of get a load of this; all they have is burgers; fries and a few beverages to wash them down.    FOOD: Cooked fresh; our burgers came out hot. They weren't sitting under a heat lamp like some places. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. For a fast food burger the flavor can't be beat. FYI: I'm NOT a fan of their fries. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: The service was fast and they were really nice. CONCLUSION: I don't know what the secret  is.  Chances are you can make a better burger at home; but at the same time there is just something about In-N-Out burgers that makes them  delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection! This In N Out is on it! They're at the top of their game to handle soooooooooooo many people and still produce such top notch food!,1.0,1.0
0,Love me some In n Out...so; I live in a state devoid of this great burger establishment so I always enjoy an opportunity to stop in and blow my calorie consumption for the day.  Upside is consistency; customer service; freshness and fun...love it animal style. Onions by request but plenty which I love...  It can often be a bit sketchy to find a seat but be patient; generally by the time your food is ready someone has finished and moved on.,1.0,1.0
0,So I read the reviews and as usual I don't pay too much attention to them because I like to make my own judgment on a place based on my experience so with that said I went in to the restaurant at 9:40 pm which is 20 minutes till close but they had over 12 employees working at what seemed full throttle which is typical for young folks trying to get off and out on a Friday night. I have to add that Chipotle is one of my favorite places to get food and having children and bills it's almost a treat to have being that for only me and my girlfriend it was 21 dollars. I got to the restaurant and there was a line. Usually a line for Chipotle but always moves fast I ordered 2 burritos; chicken for my girl and steak for me so as he was making my burrito I asked for half barbocoa and half steak he asked if I wanted double meat or just half and half and I said half and half. Well the barbocoa pan was full of meat so he gave me a tong full and the steak pan had less than a big spoon full literally 5 little pieces of steak and rather than get something fresh from what they were cooking behind him he passed my burrito off to the next stage of the burrito making phase and as i stood there looking at the 2 burritos with the meat on the rice my girls burrito had almost triple the meat mine had so rather than be a jerk and make a complaint I just asked for double meat which the guy from the next phase of the burrito making he grabbed a heaping cup full of meat. The little cups they usually put the salsa or other sides in and it was what the amount was for being a single meat burrito I asked him to go light on the hot salsa because let's face it that stuff can melt the paint off of a car if you tried. Lol but the guy put a whole ladle full. I just shook my head to which he didn't notice and started wrapping my burrito after placing the other ingredients I asked for in it. So final stage of the transaction of the burrito making production line the cash register guy asked if I wanted some chips or anything else. I love the lime salted chips and of course said yes. I didn't notice the size of the chips till I got home and to a great disappointment the chips were hardly filled to the bottom of the letters of the bag where it says Chipotle.  Which you get more if you buy a 1.49 bag from the store. So very disappointing and to have payed 21 dollars for food that was poorly put together and skimped on for chips and meat  which I had to pay double just to get what I should have gotten for the single meat price mind you; also the non existing bag of chip's. I will make sure they never get my hard earned money ever again. How could such an amazing chain become so non amazing over the last few years? For me I know that I won't be going back to this location or any of their locations which is terrible because of this experience and I truly hope my review reaches out and makes someone think twice before they go overpaying for poor food and poor service at Chipotle.

0,If you're looking for a man; this should be your next destination. Men love this place. (A coworker of mine met her fiance eating lunch here and now lives in Tampa; so if you're in the market for a burrito and a cross-country move; you might want to give it a try.)  My favorite? I love the spicy Barbacoa soft tacos (3 per order); in which they use shredded beef braised for hours and saturated with tastiness. Their meat is all naturally raised; if that's important to you. C'mon; not a fan of injected hormones in your meat? Pfffff. But; in all seriousness: the toppings are fresh; crunchy and delicious. Go fajita style; if you're so inclined; the carmelized onions and sauteed peppers are tasty. Tip: If you're a burrito type of guy (or; less likely statistically; girl); they come standard with rice. If you're not a fan of starch; ask them to skip it.,0.0,1.0
0,I placed my order online. Got home and my burrito was made wrong. I called back to let them know and they said just come back in. I informed her that I need my steak well done. It was not done well done by the time I got there so I had to wait ten minutes. As soon as I walked up I asked to speak to the manager...the girl at the front desk says she already told Management what had happened. So; I asked for the Manager again. The Manager finally comes out and I express to them that if I ask for a Manager I should be given a Manager. I also expressed my poor experience and how customers should be acknowledged by Management if there is a problem. This particular Manager didn't care so I asked for a refund and I will not be going back to Chipotle (ANY location) until customer service practices have improved.,0.0,0.0

0,The food at Chipotle is amazing of course!  But... There is always a line at this location because of how slow they make the food. They do skimp on the portions and seeing other people complain about it on here just reaffirms my suspicions.

While I was standing in line; I took great observation of my surroundings. I noticed a few details that I wasn't very fond of. First of all; the menu only had three burgers that you could order. Altogether the menu only contained a total of around 10 items. I looked thoroughly at the menu and chose my order. I ordered the Double-Double with a vanilla milkshake. Since my whole soccer team of 18 people ordered; it took a long time to get our food. While I was waiting for my food my friends were telling me about how great the food was. When I got my order; it looked like any other burger. When I sat down and took my first bite; it tingled my taste buds and definitely lived up to the hype.,0.0,1.0

I'm not a fast food kinda gal; and I never order burgers anywhere- unless they are known for them- these burgers are some of the best! Everything is homemade here; down the the hand cut fries; so don't expect to get your food before the blink of an eye (like you might at the golden arches).

Doesn't taste frozen because it isn't (even the buns; cheese and veggies taste much better than other cheap eating options). The service is outstanding; probably because they pay more than other fast food joints. Now; I will say that the food is very good taken home or back to the office; but to truly experience it's greatness; it should be eaten immediately at the restaurant or in your car in the parking lot (so the toasted bun and everything else is crisp vs. soggy). It really makes a huge difference!   ",1.0,1.0
0,First time I went I loved their chicken curry . It had a great spicy flavor and sweetened with raisins; apples and pineapple. Second time visiting I felt the food was inconsistent. The curry had few pieces of fruit and lacked flavor. We also ordered the grilled veggies. They were cooked perfectly but extremely over salted. I will be back for lunch but will probably avoid dinner time.,0.0,1.0
0,Food was great. Got the BBQ pita and tried Philly steak pita. Decent price (9/10); awesome service (10/10); fair atmosphere (5/10) and pretty good selection (7/10). We would definitely go back for lunch; not so much my first choice for dinner.,1.0,1.0
0,LOVE this place! I was a Pita Jungle devotee for years (still a fan); but Pita Di Vita has won me over. My husband and I stumbled upon it because it's across the street from our business and fell in love with the food. A lot of similiar flavors to PJ (I believe their are some family ties) so if you like them; you'll LOVE PDV.  The La Vita salad is phenomenol and huge. I order it and make sure to get an extra side of the lemon dressing b/c it's big enough for two meals. (Dressing is awesome!) Also; if you can't handle TWO meals; you can order a small like 1-2 oz. sample cup of the hummus (amazing) that I eat alongside my salad to dip the veggies in. Try the Jalepeno Cilantro hummus....freaking fabulous!  Anyways- the owners are friendly; the food is incredible. 5 stars all day.,1.0,0.0
0,What a shame; Pita Di Vita has unfortunately closed. This was such a perfect spot for fast and awesome take-out; but I think because of some personal events; the owner had to close the doors. All the best to the family.  Great for take out! The Chicken Curry is killer! Order a pita wrap; combo; or a side of chicken breast and your favorite side and you're good to go.  The front counter order takers are inviting and friendly; and the head chef/owner is amicable. Service is quick; especially if you call it in ahead for pickup.  The chicken platter and sonoran chicken are both fantastic. The sonoran chicken has a great blend of southwestern flavors and the side of beans makes the meal. Chicken is never dried out; head chef knows what he's doing.  Desserts (baklava and honey pudding) are simple; delicious; and authentic.  Simple ingredients; simple atmosphere; and healthy outlook on food make this place a perfect choice for a quick lunch or dinner on a whim. We frequent here often.  I only wish they had tabouli!,1.0,1.0

0," Had lunch here today and was very impressed!  The place is pretty utilitarian inside but definitely clean and comfortable.  I ordered the Veggie Primavera wrap with a side Greek salad.  The wrap was literally bursting with veggies--cauliflower; zucchini; broccoli; 2 types of beans; and rice all on a wheat wrap.  It's definitely not something you can eat gracefully!  Sooo good but so much food I had to take half home!  The wrap was served with a side of delicious tzatziki sauce. The Greek salad was also good--lots of fresh veggies; the salad dressing was a little different than your 
ormal Greek\  --had almost a spicy horseradish/mustard taste which I'm not sure if I liked or not.  Beautiful presentation; huge portions!  If you order your entree as a meal; it comes with either a side salad or French fries and a HUGE cup for soda.  Will definitely be back!!   ",1.0,0.0

0,First time here. It was very convenient to stop here after the gym and pool time with the family. We took it to go. We ordered the chicken shawarma and the gyro. Both with meals and side salads. My daughter got the kids cheese crisp. They packed it nicely to go and there wasn't a mess in the car. Both adult meals was a good size. Keep some gum handy or be prepared to brush your teeth after. The sauce is heavy with onions..not in a bad way when u are eating but will need an after meal mint. Good quick meal and it's not grease.,0.0,0.0
0,I went in for lunch with a friend and we told the guy at the register that we were visiting the restaurant for the first time. He immediately gave us a thoughtful recommendation and we ended up ordering what he had suggested. I got the Philly Gyro; my friend got the Chicken Curry; and we split a side order of hummus. The weather was nice so we decided to eat outdoors on their patio. We started with the hummus and it was excellent--our server told us that it is made from scratch in-house. The main entrée came out a few minutes later and it was delicious.   To top things off; our server brought us out a small dessert on the house in order to thank us for stopping by.  In summary: excellent service; reasonable price; and excellent food.  I would recommend this place highly to anyone!,1.0,1.0
0," I love their chicken curry dish; but I think it is odd that it is served on a large plate with nothing else.  Is that so my whole family can eat it?  I would prefer a smaller portion and include some vegetable; pita; etc.   Also; both times we ate there; the young lady at the register seemed not interested in helping us.  For example; I asked her what the grilled vegetables were.  Her answer was that they were vegetables that were grilled.  I asked again; what vegetables?  She pointed to the menu where it said \grilled vegetables\  .  After the third round of \  what vegetables are in it?\  ; I suggested she ask the chef.   She did; reluctantly.  I think this girl needs a different job.  I ordered the grilled veggies and they are delicious; by the way.   ",0.0,0.0

0," Sitting at my desk in my office; I could see a steady flow of coworkers returning from their lunch breaks with Fatburger soda cups. This was enough to make me crave a big; fat; juicy; heart clogging; carb-filled burger and fries. So one day I decided to venture out and have my own Fatburger experience.  I selected their King Burger combo meal because I always order more than I should. The meal consisted of a 1/2 pound burger; fries and a drink. I got the burger with all the fixins' and selected the fat fries. The total for the meal was $9.19.  Arriving before the lunch rush; there was almost no line. The order taker was friendly and didn't try to \upsize me\   or sell me anything other than what I wanted. I waited a bit longer than I wanted for my meal; but I guess that is because they cook everything when it's ordered. My only complaint is that there were no suitable containers in which to take out ketchup. They had those little paper cup things but there was no top to keep the contents from getting all over my car. There were also none of those ketchup packets to be found so I left their establishment ketcupless.  Back in my office I found that the burger and fries actually look like what is on their menu which is a surprise. The size of the meal was very good and filled me up quite nicely and then some; so I guess the food and drink was a good value for my money. My only issue was the actual taste of the food. I found it very bland and average at best. They either need to better season their meat/bun/something or start using some \  secret sauce\   to flavor up their burgers. I had the same issue with the fries. Thankfully; I was able to pile on salt and steal some leftover ketcup packets from the community fridge.   ",0.0,0.0
0,This was my first visit to fat burger it was a fat disappointment! Restaurant was dirty it took forever for the burger to come and when it did it had no taste very blan no seasoning at all only pepper. This place was over priced for the quality and service of the food in my opinion if you charge restaurant  prices you should serve restaurant quality. This place charges 10.00 for a burger and an extra 1.00 for cheese and 1.00 for every extra you get on the burger the meal did come with onion rings that were the only good part of this meal. They should call this place fat onion rings because the burger was dry and tasteless I will not return to this place I live close by and was really hoping this would be my new burger joint:(,0.0,1.0
0,These burgers are A-OK; I like that you can get a small; medium; large; x-large; and super large sized burgers.  I ordered a medium and it was a little juicy (not bad for a fast food burger) but I would still say that 5 guys or Smashburger is a little better.  Still these guys don't make a bad burger at all and I would stop in again and recommend it if you are a burger connoisseur that needs to taste every burger.  I like that this location is close to my office and I was headed to Culver's before I came here but that place smelled so bad inside I had to walk out.  I also like the atmosphere here; it is a nice clean casual looking place and comfortable to enjoy a quick lunch.,0.0,1.0

0,I've eaten at this Chipotle way more times than I would like to admit in the short time that it has been open.  It's the perfect quick and affordable meal before hitting up a game or event at the Arena.  The quality of the food and the service is as good as any Chipotle.  I'm really impressed with the facelift they have given to the space.  The old attendant; Moe's; had a very similar concept to Chipotle.  Chipotle could have been lazy and just slapped a new coat of paint on the walls; instead they redesigned the layout; and created the much more modern and inviting look that their restaurants are known for.,1.0,1.0
0,This review is not about the food. The food at the Chipotle restaurants are generally the same in quality and taste. I have never had an issue with the taste of the food while being a consumer at this location but I have had terrible service time and time again.   I work close to this location ; at a company at Westgate. Myself and fellow co workers come to Chipotle often since there aren't many options in Westgate during the day at lunch time . Well; there is Buffalo Wild Wins; Which Which and Mama Gina's but everything gets really old; really fast. Chipotle has something for everyone ; so we go there.   The taste of the food is fine and the portion of food provided is AMAZING if you are a 5 year old child. You order a burrito bowl and or burrito and you get 2 servings of rice ; veggies and everything else by default and then when it comes to meat; you get a child portion. When you look confused and or concerned and ask for a little more they  respond by asking if you want double meat; which is an extra cost of course.  The chicken; steak and other meats are what make the meal. Not cheese; lettuce; hot sauce and beans. Those are used as fillers here. Where else do you go and spend 10 bucks for a burrito with meat in it that would better accommodate a taco?  I did not want to really speak about the customer service since I will not include employee names; although I have them. Often times you leave feeling rushed. If you change your mind; please expect a roll of the eyes. Trust that someone will be upset because you as the customer want to add beans last minute. How DARE you ask for your monies worth!!?  I really wish I did not have to create an account just to write this review but I had to. I have been working near this location and helping jeep them in business since January and I have been wanting to write this and or write corporate forever and just kept saying it fast food; its fine; it will get better.

So I whipped over here today; joined by Jackie C. & Mike C. & went with a Detroit Coney Combo; which is a Detroit Coney chili dog plus ground beef added to the chili; and a regular order of fries.  The hot dog and especially the fries were great!  Like In-N-Out; they don't blanch the potatoes but rather cook them all the way through at once; and in this case with the skins on and crispy without having to ask for \well done.\    YUM!  Add in the very friendly service from the Detroit counter guy (Owner?) & you've got your 5 Stars; for sure!     :-))  Detroit Coney Combo $4.95; Fries $1.95.   ",1.0,1.0

Well; on Saturday Mr. M and I felt like goofing off and driving around aimlessly and I decided to go on a hot dog tour.    We started here and decided to adopt the attitude of \when in Rome\   and ordered what appeared to be the house specialty; The Detroit Coney Combo with the hot dog and onions and mustard and chili and the loose ground beef all in one big pile of goodness.    First; the dude working the register has more patience than I ever would because first timers have no idea how to order here and it can be a little overwhelming in the beginning.  We got to listen to him explain things a couple of times to the group in front of us; so when he got to me; I was ready.    We shared the Detroit Coney combo and the fresh cut spiral cut fries; which come in a huge serving by the way; and I'm pretty sure they sprinkle them with crack because those are totally addictive!  Fried perfectly and absolutely delicious.  I was a little nervous that the onions and chili on the combo would come back and haunt me later; but they did not.  Everyone played nice in my belly and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable.  Combo; fries; and fountain drink was $9.18 with tax.  I'll be back for sure.   ",1.0,0.0

0,I love this place.  From the first visit; I knew this was a joint I would frequent whenever I come to town for work.  In fact; I have my coworker addicted to this place now.  We decided that since this place is so great; it's on the short list of places to go with the company cool kids secret club.    The customer service is great; like really great.  The owner is helladope.  He always has an exuberant greeting; handshake; or hug for me whenever I come in.  The guys behind the counter are always super friendly and helpful.  Didn't know you needed a spoon and ketchup?...don't fret; they knew you did and they'll bring it to you.  The prices are low.  You can fill yourself up to bursting for less than twenty bucks.  There are quite a few things on the menu; but why would you get anything other than the Detroit Coney?  The hot dogs are great.  You know you're eating a good dog when it snaps when you bite into it.  The onions could be a little bit more oniony for me with just a little bit more bite to 'em.  The chili-fries are so so good.  I can feel my arteries clogging with every delicious bite and if I have a fat-girl heart attack on the way out of the door; it'll be worth it.  They also carry a bunch of Faygo; but you need not paint on your ICP face to have any.  I've had a few other things; but it's really all about the hot dogs and fries.,1.0,1.0
0," What is it that makes this place so special? I had the Combo Coney Dog; that isn't chili dog..  and it did nothing to me. Hot-dogs are substandard food no matter how much you pay for it. And the chili on top was no culinary experience at all. it made my hot-dog bun soggy. It had no great flavor; nor was in special in any fashion.   The service is good though.. just a little too much Disney over the whole \we're so genuine\  . I find it parodying true home pride.. and not in a good way. It looks clean but it is a fast food place; and I am trying to figure out what it is that people like with this place. The food isn't anything special. There is no ambiance to speak of. So what is it? They are nce here; they are. But it becomes a theme park kinda thing. \  We have all this Genuine Detroit kinda hot dogs and stuff\  ... Ohyeah; looks and taste like normal hot-dog to me.  (I was leaning to the cheese fries. in my mind it would be fries slightly overdone; a hint of vinegar and topped with some interesting hard cheese flavor. But instead it is same fries w nacho cheese (you know the crap you cannot legally refer to as cheese). I didn't try it. I saw it. So happy i didn't go that route.)  Yes; they sell some stuff like Faygo that is good and all; but all-in-all you pay for a meal that's suppose to reflect something that doesn't really exists. It's a hot dog stand with a gimmick.  A gimmick that I can't even grasp. That is it - and promoting the emperors new clothes is not my thing.   Best part of my meal - overpriced Faygo. I will not suggest to come back here.   ",1.0,0.0
0,I'm really disappointed in this location.  The last two times I've been here they haven't had the kind of meat I wanted ready.  This Thursday night at 9:20 they didn't have any steak for my burrito.  The guy said it would be ready in about eight minutes.  I told him I'd come back another time and walked out.  This Saturday at 11:30 AM I was in and asked the order taker for chicken tacos.  We both looked at the container that should have had chicken and it was empty.  The lady said it would be about 4 minutes until it was ready.  I waited and got my tacos and they were good.  I think I'll give them a while to get their act together here before I come back.,0.0,0.0

Lady fixing our bowls couldn't even speak English; got our orders wrong and after being given less than the normal serving size on our bowls; including the guac we pay extra for; Sally the cashier or manager; argued with us loudly regarding the portion sizes.  She said \I could stand here and argue about his with you all day\  !  Wow!  We were appalled!  Bathrooms and restaurant floors a complete disaster.  Place was a mess and Sally does not belong in customer service.  We are huge chipotle fans and we were treated with a completely unprofessional attitude.  Sure hope Chipotle reads these reviews.  Lose Sally or lose our business and I'm sure we are not the first to feel that way; or last.   ",0.0,0.0
0,If the food weren't so good; this Chipotle would represent my idea of one of the nine circles of Hell.  Enter on the wrong weekday evening during peak dinner hours; and you will feel like you're stuck in the middle of a daycare center.  Little kids run around as if they're in a McDonald's Play Place; but since there is no play area; they're just running around the restaurant.  If you're picking up food at this time; do yourself a huge favor and order it online to-go.  The 27 minute line (I'm not exaggerating; I timed it on my cellphone) is to be expected at 6:30 on a Wednesday night; but the crammed crowd and noise was pretty hard to bare.  Parking is also a regular pain at this shopping center.  I am not a kid hater.  I also understand that these issues are not entirely Chipotle's fault (which is why the place still gets four stars).  It's the parents job to keep their kids in line and it would be a PR nightmare for any company to try to do something about it.  But if you perfer to be in an environment without children running around like it's recess; then you may want to give another location a try.  There's quite a few other Chipotles just a couple of miles away.  The saving grace is my love for Chipotle's food.  It's the one fast-food option my girlfriend and I regularly agree on when we're too lazy to cook and not in the mood to dine out.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  The extra charge for stuff like guacamole is annoying.  But Chipotle delivers great food at a good price; so I'm more than willing to put up with the headaches to get my delicious burrito.,0.0,0.0
0,Every time I come here; the GM is super awesome. He introduced himself awhile back; and now we're on a first name basis. Not sure if that's a sign that I go too often or great customer service (maybe a little of both).  As for the food itself; It's definitely not; 'Authentic' Mexican food; but for Mexican Fast food fix; this sure does beat Taco Bell. It's always fresh; and I'm a huge fan of the HOT sauce and lime salt chips they have there. I'm literally in between two locations; one off of Shea and another off Frank Lloyd Wright and whenever I'm looking to feed my Chipotle fix; I make sure to migrate to this one.,1.0,1.0
0,When I'm craving Mexican Food; I always get tempted by Chipotle to stop by and grab a Steak Burrito.  That's exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago....I couldn't shake the image of a delicious Steak Burrito; so I dropped by this location to satisfy my craving.  When I arrived; there were 6 people ahead of me however it didn't take too long for the line to move.  I ordered my usual here....Steak Burrito w/Rice; Pinto Beans; Cheese; Guacamole; Sour Cream; and the Spiciest Salsa.  It only took a few seconds after sitting down for me to take a bite.....yep; it was just as good as I had imagined.  My all day craving was finally satisfied!

0,I eat at Chipotle almost every day and usually visit the location by the Scottsdale Quarter and experience great service. This location however has poor service and they had their staff using their left hands to scoop smaller portion sizes; really?? They give you like 5 small cubes of meat and tiny portions of beans etc... This is not good service..  They need to step up to the plate and give service that is expected at a Chipotle franchise. Needless to say I will never visit this location again. By the way everyone that has experienced the same service there is relief close by at Grayhawk with another Chipotle location.,0.0,1.0
0," Frequented this place for lunch when out on this side of town and it's always fast; fresh and easy. This place packs up quickly for lunch - so I would recommend heading here no later than 11:30 a.m. or after 1 p.m. if you need to be back to work at a certain time.  You can always order online and just grab-and-go if you need to!  The parking lot can be the tricky part of eating here; with a little bit of an awkward set-up and several different popular things right next to each other and people competing to get 	he best spot.\   Again; lunch time is the worst time for the craziness.  The line moves really quickly since the employees are efficient but still manage to keep a smile and treat customers in a friendly manner. We'll for sure be back for good food here.   ",1.0,1.0

Standard Chipotle fair; and the service is fast; efficient and very friendly.    I also recommend their online ordering service.  Pick your meal from the comfort of your desk; select a time; and even pay if you want to.  The food is ready to go when you arrive and all you have to do is walk straight to the front cashier and take it away!  Overall: A Great lunch spot for some good food.  Try online ordering.

Also; it's cheap; $2.25 for fish and $1.50 for asada and pastor. The service was very friendly. This place will be in my taco shop repertoire for sure .,1.0,1.0
0,Terrible name; great tacos.... You would never stop here if it weren't for the great reviews.  It went through some new ownership but the food is the same which is GREAT!  I have to order 4 tacos pastor each time because they are pretty much like crack cocaine for me.  I have tried a few other items here and although they are good I always go back to the pastor tacos.  This is a tiny place next door to the 7-11 and you will probably drive by this place because it is so small and there is not much parking so be careful when you go here.  Do yourself a favor and stop here for some tacos; they are small but are phenominal!,0.0,0.0
0,It was late; we had already been on the road nearly 4 hours coming back from the Grand Canyon; we were in need of a burger and fries.  As two chicks from the Northeast; we knew we had to get THE burger and fries.  Mcdonald's would just not do.  We decided to Yelp In N Out; and there it was; half a mile off the exit.  This location is laid out like any other In N Out location.  The basic menu was a glimmer of hope after a long and exhausting day.  The girl working the register was very nice and it turned out to be her first day.  I ordered a cheeseburger with animal-style fries; while my friend went with a double-double and regular fries.  The orders were a bit slow coming out but this is a place that makes everything fresh and I seemed to have forgotten that.  The food was good; as always.  It's hard to screw up the food here.  The service was friendly and the staff was singing along to songs playing on the radio (it was a quiet night; I can't fault them for that).  This definitely hit the spot.,1.0,1.0
0," When you're looking for a place to eat with not much time but you're not willing to sacrifice taste just for a \quickie meal\  ; In-N-Out is a great place to go!    Although many places claim they have \  The Best Burgers\   in town; the brutal reality is most places don't!! The coolest thing about In-N-Out; they don't talk the talk but they do walk the walk by delivering good eats consistently whether your in LA or Phoenix.    Their menu is smaller than most places and some peeps think they are limited to what they can order; but that just means they have not really experienced the true uniqueness of In-N-Out like a lot of us have ordering from their \  secret menu\  !!   My son usually gets a 1X1 with catchup; fries and a Neapolitan Shake ~ strawberry; vanilla and chocolate blended together.  My bride usually orders a protein style 1X1 burger with catchup & mustard and grilled onions with a diet.  For me; it's a 2x2 or 3x2 animal style with extra toast and well done fries!  DELISH!! The person with me today had a 5X5 aka; the \  take a nap afterwards\   burger with hot melty cheesy well done fries and black and white shake!  It looks AWESOME!  They have never got my order wrong despite me ordering something cooked a different way with each visit.  They have that cute red and white decor/packaging and include an inscription like \  John 3:16\   and \  Proverbs 3:5\  ; which is awesome!  So the next time you're ready for fast food; don't make the mistake and go to just any burger place; go to In-N-Out! Order something from their \  secret menu\   but don't tell anyone...   ",0.0,1.0
0,well this was my first trip to a firehouse subs and I was here with Rand H (another newbie to firehouse subs} well the sandwich I had was the BBQ brisket and cheddar and it was an easy 5 star sandwich. The service is also very friendly . I counted ten of them in this location and only about 8 customers.when we were there i read and took a menu with me because they have lots of great sandwiches I would like to try on return visits and yes I will return. Firehouse subs is in my books ; the best subs.,1.0,1.0

0,Not bad; probably worth a good 3.5 stars. The food is decent but the awesome soda machine; hot sauce bar; cleanliness; and friendly staff bump it up to a possible four for me. I assume they steam their meats; which turned out to be okay on the Steamer and the Italian; but on a cold turkey sub it turns the meat into this canned cat food like consistency. To me; it looked nasty but both my kids seemed to scarf it down without complaint. The steaming of the meat itself tends to make the bread soggier by the minute; so I recommend that you eat fast. I like the concept and the restaurant is nice - but I recommend working on the employee to employee communication just a tad more. I ordered a sandwich with just turkey and lettuce for my kid and ended up with mayo and tomatoes on it as well. The guy ahead of me said no mayo and ended up with mayo on his sub too. WTF.,1.0,1.0
0," 3.5 stars.... maybe 4  Forget about any of the other fast food Mexican food joints.  The \Ricos\  ; \  Bertos\  ...  Taco Bell... etc.   This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food. The beans are great!  The rice isn't bad and the burritos are huge!    We've eaten there twice and the first time around everything was a hit. No issues with the food or the service.  The second time around... the food was still pretty good. The grilled chicken nachos were pretty greasy. the chicken... although flavorful was fatty and this set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Wasn't horrible.. just could have been better.    Do drop in and give this place a try. It isn't expensive... and you better bring an appetite....as mentioned... the portions are huge.   We will go back. Hatch   ",0.0,1.0
0,Ordered take out from this place a few days ago. I had the beef enchilada; beef taco with rice and beans. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas with rice and beans. The beef enchilada meat was seasoned perfectly as were the refried beans. The beef taco meat however didnt seem to have any seasoning. The meat was good but just no flavor really. I would assume they would use the same seasoned shredded beef for the taco that they used on the enchilada but I guess not. Either way the food was very fresh and flavorful minus the beef in my taco. Prices were good for the amount of food you get. Service was a bit bla; but I was ordering take out anyways. Will definetly return to try out the rest of the menu.,0.0,0.0
0,I have passed this little place by a million times on random trips to the grocery store. Today my husband and I finally popped in for a quick; cheap lunch.

0,I was not impressed with this place. I ordered a 2 taco combo one carne asada and one pollo asado. The taco shells were thick and hard. The meat was bland. I had to put lots of sauce on it to give it some spice. Also; I ordered tortilla chips and a drink. My total was $11.48.

0," My trek to Whataburger was an artistic quest. I'd never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the \Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational\   in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place; I had to come here.   It wasn't bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - \  are you sure you don't want a meal; honey?\   Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which; admittedly; was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window; probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely; it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me.   The burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything you'll find at any other fast food joint and don't forget the wait; I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say; a Mickey D's or an In-n-Out (which; incidentally; Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger that's exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust you're inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger; plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal; fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda; and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine; when; in fact; by going to those other places; you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger; meal; soda; dessert assembly (and don't forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation); in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe); and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?

0,24/7 hours = good  However; they rarely get my order right and by the time I get home I don't feel like driving back after a long day the office or school; even though it IS the closest location to my house. They always re-read my order to me to verify it's accuracy but then they put it on the burger anyways (Mustard when I ask for NO mustard; once they added random mayo to my burger; and once they left out my pickles) Now what's a burger with no pickles.  The shakes are always very runny compared to the location on 3rd Ave and Indian School. That location is the one I go to now because this location can never seem to get it right; even after a number of second; third and fourth chances.  I love me some Whataburger but will no longer be visiting THIS location.,0.0,0.0
0," Five guys offers a basic selection of burgers; sandwiches; and hot dogs; with a plethora of toppings to choose from; free of charge! You can choose between a two patty burger (The regular size); or the \little\   one patty size. Fries can either be plain or tasty Cajun style.   I went with a \  little\   bacon cheeseburger. Don't let the moniker fool you- there is nothing little about this burger! It was a sizable portion of beef; with fresh; tasty ingredients. We also split a medium size order of Cajun fries.  I went with \  all the way\   minus mayo; and added jalapeno. \  All the way\   means basic ingredients you would typically find in your burger; outlined in black on the menu board. Such ingredients include mustard; ketchup; lettuce; pickles; tomato; grilled onion; grilled mushroom; and mayo. The more non-traditional toppings are outlined in red on the menu board; and include jalapeno; relish; and A1 sauce.   Service was fast and friendly; and my burger and fries were made in no time.  The burger was nicely grilled; and the veggies were fresh and crisp. Even the jalapeno was fresh and thinly sliced. It packed a punch! The bacon was the equivalent of 1 strip on the burger; which was cooked nice and crisp. The grilled onions were a nice addition; but if you order them on your burger don't expect a lot of caramelized flavor on them since they'll taste a little more steamed than grilled.  The fries were delicious. The Cajun spice mix dusting them were a good addition. The medium size is a good size if you are sharing with someone.  The drink fountain is the cool \  create your own\   soda machine; with a multitude in diet and regular options. Orange flavored mello yello? Lime ginger ale? Vanilla diet barqs? Yes please!

0," Okay; generally good food and pleasant service overall. Tonight it was not that.   No baskets for the peanuts in either of the boxes.  I asked if they had any and they eventually put some in one of the boxes. Order placed was slow in delivery.   Three orders came in after the order I placed; with minutes in between; and I watched them get called and leave the building well before my order was ready. My order:  one (1) small burger; plain; and one cheeseburger with catsup;  mushrooms; grilled onion; jalapenos and one medium french fry.  In case you hadn't heard before;  they are known for their large fry orders. I got home to a small fry and my receipt shows i did pay for the medium size which is supposed to be enough for 2 - 3 people.  I also asked for nutrition information at the same time I was placing my order and the person taking my order showed me a card with what comes ON the sandwiches but was unsuccessful finding one so she asked another guy (the manager?!) behind the counter.  While he's scavenging to find one she walks to the other register to help another customer.  Not once does he acknowledge me or say anything to me about never seeing them in the store but he is digging around at the front counter just like she had done. I ask if I can just pay for my order and that It'll be okay if they can put the brochure with my burgers to go.  He completes the payment transaction and then promptly disappears to the back room.   So now I've waited for my order I ask again about the nutrition information brochure because there's nothing there.  Guy (manager?!)  once again disappears to scavenge for one; without saying a thing like \ill be right back; i couldnt find one; maybe look online\  ...;  -nothing.   A girl follows him into the back room after I ask IF they actually have them or am I standing just around waiting for the fries get cold.  She returns a few minutes later to tell me they don't have any. The other questions i asked of the two that were at the counter went in one ear and out the other.  They looked at me as if to acknowledge my question but turned and walked back to pull napkins.  I was surprised to the point of shaking my head and laughing at the situation. FWIW; I picked up son and hubbies food here and got myself a sandwich at Jimmy Johns.  Had much better service there too.  Oh yeah Five Guys; way to represent.   ",0.0,0.0

The last time I went; the burrito my boyfriend ordered was half the size it typically is. Mine fell apart while the girl was making it; but she kept going so when I opened the foil; all the ingredients fell out of the tortilla.The cashier was quick to take my money; but she ignored our burritos waiting to be bagged. Four burritos piled up; waiting to be bagged; while she stood there blankly staring into space.   No one says a simple \hi\   anymore; just \  burrito or bowl?\   and no \  have a nice day\  .

0,Ok; I have read other posts that ran into the same issues that I did here. The food was average but it may have been better if I could have got what I wanted. It is not that they got my order wring; but they ran out of some of the things I wanted. I get that it was dinner time and people had been in there all day; but you have to know when you are running out of guacamole (which is $1.50 anyway); and find a way to get more. It wasn't just the guacamole that they were out of; they also somehow ran out of brown rice.  I ended up going with a cilantro lime rice; which was good; but again not what I wanted. Over all I feel like I got a bunch of beans; ok amount of chicken; no guacamole; and a secondary kind of rice.   I don't come here often and this is not the way to get me going back.,0.0,0.0
0,This is your standard Chipotle with standard fare. The place has a decent sized dining area and a large patio. The patio is nice because for some reason they keep the place at sub zero temperatures inside. Ok so that's an exaggeration; but at the same time; as Arizona residents we are better acclimated to the heat and don't necessarily need it to be so darn cold inside.   Aside from that; the place kept pretty clean and the service is friendly and efficient.  On my last trip I ordered a chicken salad with guacamole. I'm not sure if it was a standard serving; but I got a monster dollop of guacamole. It was pretty darn good. The rest of the salad was ok. The chicken was over salted and there wasn't much lettuce; but with the salsa and black beans; all and all it was a fresh and satisfying meal that I would order again.  I usually get a side of chips; but lately I've noticed that they are way too salty. But still really good.  Enjoy!!,1.0,1.0

When I pulled up there was still a bit of a wait; about 6 or 7 cars were in front of me. I can only imagine how long that line gets at noon! Any way; I ordered a #2 animal style with a dr. pepper.

0," This is very much a review of this location and not the chain.   It would be nice if the busy periods where they have an order taker outside was done with a bit more courtesy;\what do you want\    wouldn't be it. Small enough to ignore but add in the fact diet soda has never been root beer; my kids hamburger with only ketchup/tomato now = cheeseburger.Nice one.   Also these have to be the worst travelling burgers re their heat retention. I live pretty close and it wasn't remotely as good as eating it right there; e.g; 3 minutes is a long time in the desirability of this food.

0," The food; really good; especially for the price. I noticed a few \yelpers\   prefer McDonald's over this place. My only comment to them is that these same folks would probably eat dog crap if you put syrup on it and call it tasty.  Those people obviously have never had a good hamburger. McDonald's is the bottom of the barrel guys; IN-N-OUT is the creme de la creme. Anyway; I always order mine special; (no sauce; add mustard and extra mustard on the side). It's always correct. The only drawback is the parking lot and not enough tables inside the restaurant to comfortably seat everyone at the busy lunch time. (Saw some folks waiting to find a table and they ended up eating outside due to nowhere to sit inside). IN-N-OUT might want to make the restroom area smaller and increase the inside dining area. Other than that; the food was great and the price was more than reasonable. I also appreciated the good customer service. Very rare these days.   ",1.0,1.0

The MEAT: sliced fresh for every sandwhich. The toppings...different and very good.  You can order your sub \mikes way\   and it will come with lettuce; tomatoes; white onion & LOTS of (too much imo) oil and vinegar... as for the prices;  i think the people complaing about an 11.00 samdwhich are failing to mention;  that size sandwhich is literally 3 meals! I get the regular sub which is still huge & end up eating one half for lunch & the other for dinner. You can get the mini which is plenty of food for ME (probably not enough  if your a guy or have a hefty appetite ) for under 5 bucks. One thing that constantly keeps me coming back is the customer service. I would much rather spend my $ in a place that takes pride in it's customer service;  listens; and gives you what you asked for than any other mediocre serviced sub shop offering a 5.00 footlong and an attitude.

0,First time at Jersey Mikes today. Arrived at 11:45 for lunch and there were a dozen guests plus three in line.   I ordered a regular Italian with no frills for $7.80 with tax. The service was efficient if a bit fast. Seemed they were competing with Jimmy Johns for speed. I like my meal in a hurry but I don't like to be rushed. The guy in line behind me was completely flustered since they talk so fast you can't hear or understand them. They also had to add some condiments to my sub that they had missed.   On to the food: the bread was fresh; baked just right with a slightly crunchy crust and soft middle. The veggies were crisp and the meat/cheese were sliced to order. The portions seemed a bit slight compared to Port of Subs but there were options; like pepper relish; that POS doesn't offer.   I will return to JM again and try a hot sandwich.,1.0,1.0
0," What can I say. I am a hamburger slut. When I lived in Seattle I pined for the mecca of In-N-Out. Definitely a plus to moving to the Phoenix area.  Here are 2 major things I like about In-N-Out in in general: protein style and the fries.   I've eaten at this location; oh; hmmm.. a ew\   times now. I have noticed some quality differences. Sometimes the fries are a little dry. Or a little mushy (which is exactly how I like them actually.) Sometimes my burger tastes a little bit like onions (which I like) and sometimes it doesn't. I've tried ordering w/onions and w/grilled onions but it doesn't give it the same taste. Sometimes the tomatoes suck and I take 'em off.   Those inconsistencies are what is adding up to this place not getting 5 stars. But; of course; I'll be back.   ",0.0,1.0
0," I love this place. One of my favorite burger joints. I have been to In N Outs before but recently friends have exposed my to the \secret\   menu. Double Doubles are great but they are awesome when you get them animal style. 3X3 animal style forget about it. I have died and gone to cheeseburger heaven. Also love the fact that this one is close to work and home.  Such a simple menu; burgers; fries; shakes and drinks but it is when you get into the customization that you find the magic of In N Out. Animal style burgers; grilled cheese sandwiches; animal style fries; etc. The combinations expand so much just by adding a few simple things to an already simple menu.  The staff is awesome too. No one ever seems to have a bad day and be grumpy. They are always in a great mood. It borders on creepy because everyone who works there is so nice and looks like they are from the 50s. It borders on the Stepford Wives almost. Maybe we are just so used to less than perfect service that when we get great service we don't know how to handle it.  Can't go wrong with a 3X3 animal style; fries and a chocolate shake. Love it. Best place ever.   ",1.0,1.0
0,In-N-Out is the hands down best franchise/chain burger joint around.    A simple no-frills menu means that they can concentrate on providing the freshest; highest quality ingredients; such as crisp lettuce; fresh tomatoes;  never frozen patties and fresh cut fries cooked in clean oil.   Also the free refills on drinks is great; especially during summer in Phoenix.  Decor wise; In-N-Out keeps it clean and classic; like the burger joints of yore.    Service is quick and friendly; likely because the the staff are paid higher the minimum wage  For those in the know; there is a 'secret' menu that can be used to customize your orders.  4 out of 5 stars because; it is still a chain after all...,1.0,1.0
0,It's true : Having grown up in California; I love me some In-N-Out!  It's definitely over hyped; but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around; make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy.   They pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts; which explains the fabulous customer service.   Haha; give me a break; it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently.   Seeing as this In-N-Out is by my office; it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young; dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees.   Dropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style; Protein Style; Extra Crispy Fries.  Kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her.   I asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me.   When I looked at my receipt; I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order; and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this.   Usually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin; ZERO stars for Kayla.   I don't come here very much; but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.  Sorry for the two star rating; In-N-Out; but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together.,0.0,0.0

She had a burger and asked for grilled onions; only without the secret sauce...slightly Animal Style perhaps...and a milkshake to go with.

0," I secretly moved back to this area of the country strictly for the In-N-Out Burger factor.. Nothing anywhere compares to it. In fact; after my last visit I was reminded how perfectly delicious it is and I am changing my last meal on earth to an animal style burger; well done fries and a Neapolitan milkshake. It really is the American dream.  I am always fascinated when I walk into any on of their establishments. Always clean yet so disorderly.. The lines are always retarded long; and there are always people standing everywhere; but somehow they never fail to deliver every meal hot; fresh; delicious and FAST. I have NEVER encountered a broken ATM inside either.  Not everyone is aware of their \secret menu\  ; with items such as the 2x4; flying Dutchman; the protein style burger and my fave; animal style... In fact; the secret items actually outnumber the items legitimately on the menu which only consists of a Hamburger; Cheeseburger; Double-Double; French Fries; Coca-Cola products and three shakes: chocolate; vanilla and strawberry; of course. I'm pretty sure you can download a PDF of their menu somewhere online; but even if you don't know the terms; the employees at In-N-Out will pretty much do anything to a burger if you ask them.. I also recommend the fries well done.. otherwise they are kind of soggy.   Now I am hungry; I think I've decided whats for lunch!   ",1.0,1.0
0," The first time I ate at In-N-Out was when the chain first popped up in the Phoenix area. I wasn't too impressed. I had a plain cheeseburger; and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu.   I went in again to try their burgers again; this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style; with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat; melted cheese; crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go; because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger; extra pickles; and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.  Compared to other fast food chains; you get a really good value for your meal here. The extra ingredients for \animal style\   don't cost any extra; and the burger meat tastes way better than something similar for the same price elsewhere. The veggies were very fresh; as opposed to the wilted veggies you find in some places from burgers sitting out on heat lamps for who knows how long.  The neopolitan shake was pretty tasty. It's another \  secret menu\   item; and while I've never had a chocolate; strawberry; and vanilla shake all in one; this will not be my last!  I wasn't too impressed with the fries; despite being freshly cut and fried. They tasted a bit dry and crumbly.   Service was very friendly; and the cashier even gave me a cup for water while we waited the few minutes it would take for our meal to be made. Once we were done; another staff member came by to clear our table. Very nice service for a fast food place!   ",1.0,1.0

0,After many months of hearing how delicious Chick-fil-A is I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. Since I have never been here before I bought a regular chicken sandwich; chicken nuggets and some waffle fries for my son and I to share so we could try a variety of things.  The service in the drive thru was friendly and quick. I was in and out in no time. The food on the other had left a lot to be desired. To me the fries were a little undercooked but still decent. The chicken nuggets were cooked pretty good and seasoned well. The chicken sandwich was so dry I could barely gag it down. Even after adding some sauce to it; it was still dry. Bottom line it was ok. Nothing I would drive far to get because honestly I could go to Carl's JR and get a better chicken sandwich right by my house. Maybe I expected to much because of how everyone raves about it. I probably won't be back.,1.0,0.0

0,This place was a little confusing for me.  There were no descriptions of the food so I was flying blind when I ordered the California burger.  I just assumed it would have something like avocado or ranch or fish or sunshine or eddie money....but it didn't.  Nothing California about this burger other than that's probably where the lettuce came from.  Speaking of lettuce; this burger had it with some uncooked onions and a tomato.  These aren't normally things I want on my burger but; apparently; that's what constitutes a California burger.  It was more expensive than a regular burger because of the toppings.  Nice.  Since I failed to realize any of this at the time; I was still pretty hungry when I finished.  Since this is a steak-burger place; they like to flatten out the beef until it looks like the sole of your shoe.  It's pretty thin and not very filling.  The taste is good and it's not greasy (unlike Steakenburger) but I really wished I had ordered a double.    The fries were actually really good which made me really happy.  I ended up putting some on my burger just to try and give it some more substance.  Not bad.  Feels like I'm back in Pittsburgh.  Anyways; I probably wouldn't go back here but who knows?  It was better than Five Guys so they have that going for them.  It was a pretty ho-hum experience and that's probably what you'll get too.,0.0,0.0

0,I have been an a burger kick lately; so a couple of my partners-in-crime and I went on a burger crawl...Freddy's was our first stop. All I can say is WOW! I had the Triple Steakburger; fries and drink combo ($6.89.) The burger is a smash burger...the meat is smashed on the grill in to thin patties which get all crunchy on the outside. I ordered the burger with cheese; mustard and pickle. It was delicious! The fries are the tiny shoestring fries like Steak & Shake fries. They were hot; fresh; and amazing! They also have diet Dr. Pepper which in my opinion is a big plus.    After devouring the burger and fries I ordered the Signature Turtle Sundae...vanilla custard; hot caramel; hot fudge; pecans; whipped cream; and a cherry. This sundae was absolutely amazing!!! The custard was dense and creamy and the toppings made me melt faster than the ice cream. Yummy stuff!  The employees were all friendly; cheerful; and efficient! The restaurant was very clean.  Thankfully for my waistline and circulatory system I live in a different state because If I lived nearby I would be eating here way to often.,1.0,1.0
0," I have a certain affinity for anything named \Freddy's;\   my friends can tell you why; so when I first had the chance to go to Freddy's Burgers a couple years ago I was excited. I went on the recommendation of a friend; and it's still one of my favourite chain burger joints.   The burgers are made fresh to order; no heat lamps keeping your Big Mac warm here! The meat is so much better than your average fast food place. the buns are great and they always manage to get that awesome crispiness on the outside of the burger. My partner gets the patty melt; and keeps eating it even after she's unbuttoned her pants; mumbling; \  I'm so full... I really shouldn't eat any more.\   I LOVE the shoestring fries. I've never had an issue with soggy; cool fries. They're always hot; fresh and salted just enough. The Chicago Dogs are pretty darn good too.   Get dessert! I'm a big fan of their frozen custard. My staple would be the turtle; with extra caramel. :)   The whole atmosphere is nice and very retro. Oldies on the radio; HUGE booths so you don't have to worry about where you're going to fit everyone and clean. Clean is a big deal to me. i HATE going to fast food places where the remnants of the last dozen customers are all over the tables and floor.   ",0.0,1.0

0,This place is generally pretty good; however;  lately their employees are not very friendly. They are rush you; and always act like they are going out of their way to get your food. (News flash I think it is your job) You have to continue to repeat yourself; and they never tell you they are out of something before you order half your food. If I knew you were out of guacamole I wouldn't have ordered. Then they give you an attitude when you want to wait for them to make something they are out of. I am not sure if they are under new management. But this location has changed quite a bit; and not for the better.,0.0,0.0

0," This is the worst Chipotle location I've ever been to. They don't hold up to the standards set by Chipotle at all.    -People here move at a snail's pace. Im not saying they need to rush; but the way everything is set up should make for a smooth and quick experience.  - If you tell them what you want they can only remember one thing you said. Example: \Pico and hot salsa.\   Then they just put Pico on and look at you. \  Sour cream; cheese; and lettuce.\   Puts spur cream on and just looks at you.   - Ordered tacos to go; when I get home with them; 5 minutes later; I have a pile of sour cream all over my \  tacos\   which now resemble a casserole of some sort. I can't even figure out where one taco begins or ends. So appetizing for $8.   If I wanted crap I would go to Taco Bell. At least there a taco still looks like a taco and they keep the contents inside the tortilla.   ",0.0,0.0

0," I am an avid Chiptole fan; but never have I had as terrible service as I did today at this location.   I used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch. My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot; ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online; she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then \went to the back\   and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay; after I had already told her I had paid for it online.   The person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it; that was actually the least of my concerns; that happens; I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location; there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving; mind you; there was no line; which is rare for any Chiptole; so it really made no sense that our service was this poor.   We asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07.   So an order I placed at 2:20; was supposed to be ready at 2:45; and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online.   I will not be going to that Chiptole ever again. And will defintely think twice before ordering online with you guys; very disappointing. :(   ",0.0,0.0

It's a lot easier to special order burritos and quesadillas and have them made in two minutes than it is to do it at home and clean up the mess.

Both times I've stopped by it's been clean and pretty speedy service. Every time I come in; I am surprised by all the extra room around to the side and out on the patio and it makes me happy.  I'm sure anyone reading this has been to Chipotle; but if not; or if you're feeling like trying something new.. my signature dish for the past few years has been carnitas bowl with black beans; corn; fajita; lettuce and a little bit of the dairy stuff.

The burgers are good and it's always fun to design it exactly how I want it on that given day. Be warned; the \little\   burgers are single patty and regular burger is a double. An order of regular sized fries easily feeds two; possibly three people. And the Cajun spice is the way to go there.  The biggest con with the joint is the parking. It's awful on a good day.

If you are new to cane's the simple question to answer is can you eat chicken? No? Sorry; you're unlucky. Yes? Run; don't walk your way here! Chick-Fil-A can keep the chicken sandwich; these guys invented the chicken finger! Just get three things: chicken fingers; sweet tea; and sauce. The fries are ok; so is the toast; but really everything here is just filler. The sauce should be tested it's that addicting it's a little warm but not spicy and the sweet tea might be liquid sugar; but no part of your tongue will care. The chicken itself is juicy and will not last. Within minutes you will have a \i ate the bones\   moment.  Faults? Price.

0,This place does a fine job at cooking chicken tenders and fries. They even got the Texas toast down to a perfection.  Came in here while trolling around Tempe and decided to give them a shout out. Located very close to ASU and should be a popular spot when you need to catch some bird.  Ordered the biggest thing on the menu called the Caniac Combo. Stopped drinking the dreaded soda pop and went with some dihydrogen monoxide. It is a lot better for you and the price of the combo goes down quite a bit.  The menu here is very simple and they give you a basic no thrills meal. You can always substitute some of the sides if you so desire. The big thing everyone cries about is the top secret sauce. Maybe I missed the boat on this one but it is nothing more than some doctored up mayonnaise.  Food is pretty good and the chicken is very tender. Good chance they are doing that southern trick of marinating it in some seasoned butter milk overnight. That always keeps it juicy and flavorful after frying.  Would like to see some more dipping sauces. Just take some regular Franks hot sauce and add equal parts of brown sugar and simmer it in a pan. Some country fried chicken gravy would be good also. Maybe just offer some jalapenos or something spicy to add a little kick.  Definity gets really busy around lunch time. Saw tons of sweaty blue collar workers (like me) coming in and chowing down on big plates of chicken. Some of them looked like they could have skipped the soda pop as well.  Recommend bringing your own dipping sauce or hot sauce to complete the occasion. Some people just need more options. CLUCK CLUCK A-OK!  3.25 STARS,0.0,0.0
0,Tried Raising Cane's for the first time -- Amazing!!  I love that this place is ASU orientated. You have the Sun Devil Logos and vibe. The restaurant is clean and appealing.   I ordered the Box Combo: 4 Chicken Fingers; 1 coleslaw; 1  Texas Toast; Fries; and a drink. The food came out in less than a minute; which dazzled me.   I sat down and began my meal. First; the TOAST! My new favorite! The Texas toast was amazingly soft and incredibly tasty. The french fries were good; as well as the coleslaw. As for the chicken; it was juicy and tender.   Overall; the food and combination was GREAT. Will come back!!,1.0,0.0
0,I know people who rave WILDLY about Raising Cane's; but I just think it's okay. I've eaten their twice; once drive-thru another I ordered inside. The service is quick and friendly and the restaurant is always clean. If you want something flavorful; I would suggest going somewhere else. But if you have a chicken tenders craving; you probably can't go wrong here.,1.0,1.0
0,Decide to try this place and was a bit disappointed that  I waste my time and money on it. I thought it was going to be some spectacular food when it taste no different then chicken strips you would get at Sonic; McDonalds; etc.  Its way OVERPRICED. I wasnt happy that there was only one dipping sauce flavor. It was gross. We also ordered the sandwhich and wasnt too happy it had that sauce spread all over it.  I asked for larger Lemonade and was given a small size.   The coleslaw tasted funny so want fond of that. Only thing I ate was the texas toast and that was pretty weak too.,0.0,0.0
0," Going to college in Tallahassee; the one spot that was a winner for everyone was \Guthrie's of Tallahassee\  ... Same style menu & the staple of a college meal here at Raising Cane's. Even more fitting that it's near ASU Campus. Chicken Fingers; Fries; Texas Toast & coleslaw (swap-able). Granted; it's a chain with locations globally I believe; but it still provides that same level of comfort I had back in school... A simple and great tasting meal!!!  Its a basic concept & they keep it simple. They sell chicken tenders and that's what I like about them. Expanding the menu to do \  too much\   would take away from things; so hopefully they keep it simple. If ur a dipping person like me; order an extra sauce or exchange the coleslaw for another item like toast!   ",0.0,1.0
0,Pluses:  Service; priced well for what they are attempting (attempting being the key word) clean; fun atmosphere.  Minuses: I had the burger with A1.  It was smothered in A1 overpowering.  Made the bun super soggy.  Burgers are well done;  no other option.  Only American cheese no other cheese choice.  Really?  Fries were unevenly cooked.  Some were still white others crispy-very inconsistent.,1.0,1.0
0,I like Five Guys Burgers and Fries.  They are up there with In and Out Burger.  In and Out Burgers are presented all nice and tidy; Five Guys Burgers and Fries are more in your face.  I have to open wide to take that initial bite.  It is a good juicy; drippy; carnivorous delight.  I always order the Cheeseburger.  I like being able to add toppings to the burger when you order.  It makes it easy.  The fries are good; almost over seasoned.  Almost.  I still ate them all.  4 stars.  I am a fan.,0.0,0.0
0,Of all the burger places in the area; this is my favorite. Love all the toppings and the freshness of the burger.  I know everyone raves about the fries & I have to agree. What's makes them taste so great is the freshness...their kind of old-fashioned in the way that they are like home made. They are amazing. I do think this place is a little pricey. 30bucks for burgers fries & drinks is a lot for 2 people.  But I guess that's how it is these days...at least it tastes great!  My only complaint about this location is the customer service.  They people aren't overly friendly or welcoming...they have a job to do & they do it. Nothing terrible or overly rude; but I like a smile with my meal.,0.0,1.0
0,Extremely disappointed with the service I received today. For being a Sunday and being prime lunch time there were only about 2-3 people ahead of us when we got to the tortilla press yet not one person greeted us when we entered the building; not even the manager who was working on the line. Then when we did get to the line we received no greeting other then 'what can I get for you.' Then was denied my request for a specific item that has been receiving A LOT of attention. I had requested a quesadilla and a burrito and was going to request that my burrito was wrapped with the quesadilla. Commonly being referred to as a 'quesaritto.'  The tortilla press worker didn't consult any other staff and did not take into consideration that there wasn't more then three people behind us. The entire mood of the restraint was actually quite dull. The only person who seemed to be in any type of friendliness was the girl working at the salsa station and even that was minimal. There was NOTHING exceptional or anything near the expectations that I have usually received for a chipotle visit. For the tortilla press girl to refuse my request like that was infuriating and to have an excuse such as 'we don't do that during certain hours' is ludicrous. If I were to visit ANY other establishment and request something off of their 'secret' menu I would never be denied.   Needless to say I am utterly disappointed with the entire visit and will also be posting said review on Yelp. I hope when I call into the store that they have a better explanation for why I was denied my request since this was the one thing I visited the store for today.   Also; for the individual just standing in plain site in a baseball cap and street clothes was the icing in the cake for me. I won't be returning to this location ever.   Only reason I'm giving this is a two star is because I still love the food.,0.0,0.0
0,The service at this location has always been great and the food has been really good in the past but as of late the quality of the food has declined. The steak has been over cooked and it just doesn't have the flavor other locations have. Overall the ingredients just don't have the same great taste that other locations have. The last 4 times I ate at this location have been a little disappointing. But I do need to stress the service is good and it's always clean in the resturant I just hope they can bring up the quality and taste of the food back to what they did in the past.,1.0,1.0
0,Not a fan of this location at all. I love chipotle as a whole and it's a great company   This location makes me think different. I usually go during my lunch break and it is usually quite busy but there service is terrible and they give you barely any rice or veggies but charge you an arm and a leg for there tiny portions. I went there yesterday and I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning. They need to step up there game.,0.0,0.0
0,Chicken Fingers Don't Get Any Better Then This.    If you are a Chicken Finger  lover; like my nephew I encourage you to give Raising Canes a try. These Fried Chicken Fingers take a back seat to no one. Raising Canes boneless Chicken Strips and dipping sauce are hard to beat.    Raising Canes never-frozen chicken tenderloins are fryed-to-order and accompanied by the best dipping sauce known to man.  The meat stays juicy; none of the dryness problems that plague lesser variations of fried chicken strips. The Chicken Strip combo box is served with crinkle cut fries; Texas toast; and a side of coleslaw.  You have to try the fresh squeezed lemonade; it's the best.   Raising Canes has quick service and friendly staff; so if your in the mood for chicken fingers; head on over.,1.0,1.0
0,I love this place. It reminds me of Zaxby's from the South. Simple good food; dipped in tasty sauce.   I always like getting the Big Box meal so I can have the coleslaw; but I find the coleslaw tastes too salty for my liking. It's the one thing that makes me a little sad; but it won't stop me from enjoying everything else.  Service today was great; every single employee seemed to have great customer service skills; which was refreshing for a fast food joint.,1.0,1.0
0,I will admit - Cane's sauce is what keeps me coming back! But at this particular location; it's the staff as well. They always deliver outstanding customer service; which is awesome because there are so many places that hire these young kids who are just brats. Whoever is the hiring manager - keep up the good work! And give your staff a pat on the back.,1.0,1.0
0," I was surprised by this place.  When I first seen it; I was thinking it was just another fast food joint. When I had gone in side. I was like; \whit is this; it just have chicken fingers? What gives.\   Then I ordered and; Wow.\   The food was great. And I can see why specialising in one foid type; really makes a difference. Service was good; inside was clean and well decorated.

0," I like chicken fingers and have been watching this place go up. The place is brand new. There was plenty of parking. The service was efficient and friendly. But there is more to lunch than looks.  The 3 finger combo is just under $6.00 so even light eaters should bring a fat wallet. I was hungry and went for the 6 finger \Caniac Combo\   for $8.30. My 11 year old son and I don't spend as much in a sit down restaurant as we did on today's fast food  lunch. There was plenty of food; unfortunately there is significantly more bad fries than average chicken. The chicken fingers are at best average and the sauce did not impress. Fortunately we had some Tobasco buffalo sauce to kick it up a notch. The fries are Ore-Ida without the crispy golden-brown outside or steamy inside.  The combo professes to include Texas Toast - mine did not. I took the time to call and let them know. They did not apologize; just asked me to hold. No longer friendly or efficient :(  Eventually they came back on the line and let my son (I had to get back to work) know they would take care of it next time. Neither of us knows what that means and we not likely to find out.   ",0.0,1.0
0,For a fast food place; this is 5 stars.  Excellent chicken fingers - juicy with a think breading.  Their Texas Toast is delicious too. Fries are average - but i am a sucker for a crinkle fry.   Service is always friendly and my order is right every time - which isn't always the case for fast food.  If you want delicious fast food this place is great.,1.0,1.0
0,Not bad; but not great.  Just standard chicken strips.  The service; however; was the best service I have had a a fast food establishment.  The staff was wonderful.  I would choose Cane's over another establishment because of the staff.,1.0,1.0
0,Very glad Cane's made their way to Arizona...it was one thing I missed about living in Las Vegas! It's not close to home; but always worth the drive for fresh; hot and delicious food and great service. The staff is friendly; the restaurant is clean and it is cheap comfort food.,1.0,1.0
0," Met up with friends here for lunch.  They handled the lunch rush pretty well but nothing outstanding or unique.  I got an Italian on wheat bread.  The bread was soft and yummy; the very limited(variety-wise) toppings were fresh; but the sandwich seemed scant on the meats.  They were generous with the tomatoes and lettuce but the sandwich was still 80% bread.  I had it \Mike's way\  ; which also included what seemed like a pint of oil and vinegar on each side.  The last few bites of my sandwich were soggy-yuck!  Price is high for what you get.  Easy parking and average service.  I'm still looking for a sandwich place with the quickness of Subway but the deliciousness of Cheba Hut.   ",0.0,1.0
0,I was down here doing some shopping today; and saw that there was a Jersey Mike's in this shopping complex; and I couldn't have been happier.  I spent the most of this morning running errands and getting some shopping done; and had worked up an appetite.  I was to hungry and tired to go home and fix something; so I cruised into Jersey Mike's for a sub.  The place itself is clean!  Nicely decorated; with ample amounts of seating.  They have a few tables outside; but I ate indoors since it was a brisk 95 degrees today.  I went with the #9; which is the club (I think.)  It came with Turkey; roast beef; cheese; and all the toppings.   The menu listed that it also came with bacon as well.  Well; when I ordered; I told the guy NO BACON.  He was fixing a few other subs at the same time; and as I was watching him; I saw him put a strip of bacon on what I thought was my sub.  He also forgot to add mustard as well.  When I got his attention; I asked him of the sub at the end was mine.  He said yes; and I requested that he remove the bacon; which he did.  He also added my mustard; thank goodness.  Anyways; I got chips and a drink with it; and all around; it was tasty.  Not a bad deal; really. I'm glad I went!  I also got a cookie too; free of charge.  The guy who was running the register handed out cookies to us; as I think it was time for him to rotate a few fresh ones in.  He kindly handed me a white chocolate chunk cookie; and boy; was it good.  YUM.  I really like Jersey Mike's; and would gladly return in the future.,0.0,1.0
0," I'm always in the mood for a good sandwich; so I stopped by Mike's.  As anxious as I was; I was STUNNED by the sky-high prices for what you get.  I mean; how good can a sandwich be to command 30% over market value; and 30% under volume consumed?    The bun was 70% of the presentation; and although the buns are worthy and important; they should be 20%.  The meat and cheese should be at least 50% of the value for the sandwich.  Any good consumer knows that.  Here we go; with no need to elaborate---  The outcome of the big 3:  Service:   This part was average; and it's what you would expect at a busy sandwich shop.  We were 3rd in line; and it was 7 minutes before we walked out the door.  Taste:  I liked the taste; although I was expecting SO MUCH MORE because of the hype that they put into their t.v. commercials.  After hearing the commercial; I expected them to be the most-perfect sub; just like they said.  The bun is 70% of the sub; and while soft and tasty; should've been 20% of the sub.    It was just O.K.; and it's fine for a quick bite at a sub shop.  Don't expect the meat and cheese to overpower the taste; since it's such a meager and marginal portion of the entire sub.  Price:  Welcome to the 'horrendous part' of the entire ordeal.  I have no problem paying $5 for a delicious sub.  One of the market leaders has been doing $5 subs for years; and I've often wondered why any other competitors that want to be market leaders haven't driven the price down AT ALL.  I expect that they don't want to compete in an American workplace; that is expected to be DRIVEN BY PRICE.  I would even give $10 for the most fantastic sub; like the ones that New Yorkers RAVE about the subs in New York.  Since this is a New Jersey import; I have HUGE problems paying $9 to walk out with an average sub + fixin's.  I'd have no problem unless; of course; Chandler had a average; upper-class wage compared to New Jersey's upper-class wage.  You'll notice that they are NOT the same; and you'll find that they are VASTLY different.  If this sub would've 'rocked my world'; then it's totally worth a $10 fee to escape with their fixin's.  As it was; I was left with a sub-standard sub (less than 12\) and with normal; wholesome; expected; and anti-climatic fixin's.  A big let-down from what their commercials INSIST are the best.  Summary: This shop is overpriced; and they don't get it.  They EXPECT that this is what you SHOULD pay for a 'premium' sub.  The trouble is; that Chandler is NOT Scottsdale; New York; nor New Jersey; and they haven't factored in the DESIRED sub shop that should be operating in a college community.  (we don't need more Scottsdale-type pricing; just college-kid pricing with college-kid type portions).    I doubt that the owners will agree; and also; please expect that the owners will maintain that they are \  ...doing a good thing...\   for the residents of the area.  Please disregard their fantasy leanings; since they don't understand the undergraduate population.  As far as stereotypes coming out of New Jersey; I'm also sure that these owners; just like the aggressive; post-WW2 unions; would ACTIVELY seek to prevent you from hearing what I've said about their food in this article.  I'm also convinced that they would also ADAMANTLY deny any affiliation with union henchmen.  Viva la America!   ",0.0,0.0
0,Hyped up for Firehouse for years...this location finally opened in my location; and.....meeehhhhhh...  Service was friendly; but slow; considering how many folks they had behind the counter....luckily; I was able to catch my bus back home in time.   I was recommended to get a Meatball sub...the bread and cheese presentation was beautiful and delicious...the quality of the meatball and the sauce; in my honest opinion; tasted ALMOST EXACTLY like Subway. I like Subway's meatball sandwich; but after years of eating it; I know I'm getting a tasty; but subpar meatball sauce combo...I expected more authentic out of this place. The other premium hot sandwiches on the menu looked decent enough; so I will give them a try again before I would give up on them.  I really did like the hot sauce bar they had up front.....many; many different bottles and sample size containers (a la a Filiberto's type sauce container); so I took home 5 or 6 different types of sauces i've never tried to use on different stuff later and add to my Frankenstein bottle lol.  So yeah...first impression didn't quite live up to the hype; but it did show potential.,1.0,0.0
0,We were excited to see this new location when it first opened and decided to check them out. I'm a sucker for HOT SAUCES and they definitely have a large selection.  Inside is a little crazy and the seating area is a bit tight. Just order at the counter and wait for your sandwich to arrive. TICK TOCK!  Not sure how long it should take to make a sandwich. Actually I do know and twenty minutes seems longer than normal. How hard can it be?  Ordered the New York Steamer with some Elvis Burning Love hot sauce on my first visit and then a Large Italian with a side of Mango Habanero sauce on my second.  The sandwiches were good and pretty expensive. Even my wife thought it was a bit pricy and she is the queen of sandwiches.  Service was mediocre and it took longer than we expected. Maybe it was just this location or I'm just not that crazy about their sandwiches. The best part was the selection of Hot Sauces for me.  Give them a try and see what you think. I can make several sandwiches at home for the same price and everyone should know that Hot Sauce is my middle name. A-OK ALREADY!  2.75 STARS,0.0,0.0

0,**Beware:  If you are one of the few people with a cheese allergy; DO NOT GO HERE**  They will put cheese on your sub whether you like it or not.  I do not give 1-star reviews often.  Below is the reason I think this place needs corporate management ASAP: I want to start by saying I have visited multiple Firehouse Subs locations; and I have always been impressed with the service and product received.  Since I love Firehouse Subs; I was excited when the Tatum location was opening up.  My husband and I went for lunch within the first couple of weeks of it opening; and it was an awful experience.  Firstly; the manager shouting out things at the employees very loudly).  Secondly; I received a wrong order TWICE due to my lactose intolerance issues (received with cheese and then mayo).  Thirdly; I being somewhat accused of trying to steal sandwiches by the person who put together the sandiwch; since I had to go to the counter to explain my very difficult(?) order to him. Since my husband had waited and waited to eat his sandwich because of my bad orders; the guy thought we had kept a sandwich.    Anyway; we just decided it was a new place that was super busy; so we would try again.  Today; I decided to go back.  It was not busy; but the most tables were taken.  I had a to-go order and specifically told the cashier that I did not want cheese or mayo on my order.  I asked him to put it in big; bold letters!   While waiting for my order; the manager (I think he's the manager) was once again talking to employees way too loud.  He was upset that they weren't greeting everyone when they walked in.  In my personal opinion; he should worry less about greeting every customer and more about QUALITY CONTROL.  I received my sandwich and left.  Later; when I got home; open the wrapper and there it is CHEESE; again.  Once is a mistake; twice is a habit.  Part of the larger issue; is how long a person who is lactose intolerant has to wait to get the other sandwich.  In my opinion; corporate should go there to adjust and fix things.  Although I will still support Firehouse Subs; I will not be going there too often; because that location is the closest to my house. Bottomline: I will not return to a place that is inconsiderate of sandwich changes & to hear a manager talk to his staff openly and loudly.,0.0,0.0

0,I LOVE LOVE LOVE to eat here!    I never had an InO burger til I was a student at UCI in 1991.  From that point on; I was hooked.  In 04 I moved east and every time I'm near an InO; I have to stop!    I got off the plane yesterday and asked the rental car lady how to get to the closest one.  I'd been once before but couldn't remember the directions.  My partner and I jumped in the car and zoomed over.  We were on a mission.  As soon as I walked in and smelled the burger grease; I knew I was home.  I showed some restraint in only ordering the cheeseburger combo (I normally get the double double).

0," Ok; so first things first; this is a pontless review; I mean you most likely have your opinions set already; but if like me; you move Westward and have always heard of the mythical in-N-out; I figure this might be of use to you. A) it's a chain fast food joint. So set your expectations there. Do I have a favorite burger place? Yes. Is it a fast food joint? Why no; no it's not. Neither is it this FAST (hence the name fast food eh?) or hve a drive through; or so handy after a long day dragon slaying and I just want to get back to my cave and prop my feet up. So lets dispense with the silliness; this place is what it is; it's cheap; surprisingly cheap; fast... usually VERY fast (unless there's a hella rush) Service so friendly that it's almost scary!   As for the food; the meat is decent quality for a chain and fresh; not frozen. tasteless lettuce fresh and crispy for texture; and onions either grilled or fresh cut; your choice. Now to what I tend to order... yeah they have a secret menu; and I've played with it a bit; but I only tend to go when tired and haven't planned in advance; and since I don't care enough to memorize the secret menu; all i know is \animal style\   which isn't bad at all; adds a bit of flavor and messiness to the burger; although I only had it the once. The buns are fresh; as are the fries; so i find that they benefit from extra toasting; order them both \  well done\   I find that especially for the fries; it makes a world of difference. The well done fries are much better than the usual ones.More texture and crunch etc... As for the burger; i like fresh onions; so add lots of those; and they have never let me down.   To the people that view the animal style fries as gross because of the way they \  look'? So what? How do they taste? and if it just wasnt for you; then fine; but I have never had them myself; and cant imagine I would ever order them because they looked good (or good for you!) I mean figure out the ingredients; art for the eyes was never the point! I want to try the animal fries myself; i just haven't.   If my fast options are Chick-Fi-Lay/Panda Garden/In-N-Out/Hardee's (Carl's JR out here)I would probably go for one of the burger joints; with the awareness that the entire meal at In-N-Out would cost what the burger at Carl's costs; but sometimes I don't go for cheap; and some Carls are decent.)  But as long as your expectations are reasonable; your not gonna be disappointed by the In-N-Out food.Even if it isn't what you like; its good stuff for what it sets out to be.  Might try that DQ burger a earlier review mentioned if the situation arrives.   ",1.0,1.0

0," In and out is pretty simple; fast; and cheap for a pretty good burger. The people who work there are all very nice and the food is pretty good for fast food. For me it was hyped up way too much before I went so my experience might have been a little bit of a letdown; however the burger I got was pretty good and tasted fresh. ***make sure when you order the fries to ask for them \crispy\   or else they come out pretty soggy and do not taste that good at all. Also you might want to check out the \  not so secret\   menu online and look at other options you have when ordering. Please don't forget this place is a Fast Food joint so don't expect a gourmet burger; just an affordable burger that might be a slight step above some other fast food joints.

0,Protein style well-done.....going; going; gone! Every time it's the same for me.....the grilled onions are a MUST! Just recently; I added the indulgence of Animal-style fries to the order. I'll never go without again! As for the chain; I know what to expect and am never disappointed. As for this location; I was greeted with a smile; given prompt service; and found a nice clean booth to have one of my favorite fast-food  lunches when visiting AZ.,1.0,1.0
0," After hearing about In-N-Out Burger for years; I finally was able to try it while on a trip to Phoenix.  Menu.  I walked inside and was immediately impressed with the simple menu: hamburger; cheeseburger; double-cheeseburger; fries; milkshakes; soda.  This is a burger restaurant; so why should they clog the menu with lots of other things--if I wanted to eat chicken or fish; I'd go to a place that specializes in those foods.  The simple menu made it really quick to decide what I wanted to eat.  Service.  The counterperson acted like a genuine human being--not the typical; fast-food robot.  From this point on; the word \genuine\   repeatedly came to mind.  Food.  The cheeseburger was very good; but not exceptional.  I was pleased to read that the patty was not frozen; as would be expected.  The fries--which they said were freshly hand made--were exceptional.  I can't ever remember having fries that tasted this good anywhere--really crispy.  The chocolate shake was very smooth--also made from genuine ice cream instead of some powdered box mix.  It was definitely better than any other fast food milkshake I've tried.  Restaurant:  The restaurant was cleaner than most fast-food places as was the bathroom.  Overall:  I would certainly be happy to eat at In-N-Out Burger again.   ",1.0,0.0
0," In the word's of Spongebob Square Pants; \I'M READY!\   After ten months of more Mcdonald's than I've probably eaten in the past ten years; I'm ready to leave Australia and return to my home country; the meca of fast food.   Though; I am an avid fan of the New American cuisine (vegan friendly & fair trade) I WANT SOME MEAT. I've made a list of all the fast food spots I plan on hitting up upon arrival back to the states.   This list reads as follows:   1. In N Out 2. Whataburger 3. Wendy's 4. Taco Bell   As you can see; In N Out's my number one and this is simply because it's the best. It's funny to see that Mickey D's isn't even on the list when I shamefully admit that my roommates and I eat there maybe once or twice a week.. gross; I know.   Last night over a double hamburger; fries; and a sundae all for 9 dollars; I began explaining In N Out to my house mate. In N Out isn't a place you go for just anything; most people know exactly what they like and order just that; time and time again.   Though the menu is small and simple the big tastes explain it all. The patty's aren't large in any way but the fresh lettuce; tomato; and onion combined make their burgers hard to get a proper bite in your mouth all at once.   I'm not the biggest fan of the fries so I usually opt away from them and snag a couple of my friends though I have come to In N Out alone before (which is not pathetic on any level). So yeah; like I said I get the same thing every time switching back and forth between their delicious lemonade and milkshakes. The good thing about this location is the Yogurtland in the lot right next door. So if you ever see me around the Grigio; dont be surprised if I head over for some dessert after my 'gourmet meal'.  Note for vegetarians: If you're a vego you can order off the secret special menu. This menu is not spoken about; kinda like that guy on Harry Potter who's name shouldn't be said out loud. If you know about the menu and order it theres no problem but there's no chance you're getting an employee to tell you about it! Sorry; I won't be sharing their secrets here but if you're interested definitely look up their secrets online!  Since I've been living in Australia; I've realized how condiments aren't that big over here and find it frustrating how they charge you 50 cents for dipping sauce. Sometimes I can't be bothered spending extra on sauce since even Macca's is an expensive meal but baby do I love me some sauce. In N Out's; Special Sauce is so delicious and definitely worth the extra money for a packet. Though its probably just a mixture of mayo and ketchup (kinda like big mac sauce) it's an essential add on.   This is fast food but you shouldn't expect it to be quick and easy. Every time I go to In N Out; there's a drive thru line through the parking lot. Thankfully; they've got employees who wear goofy outfits standing outside with Ipads sending your order in when the drive thru is like this.  I understand I may have gotten peoples hopes up but I suggest going into your first In N Out experience with low expectations. I was honestly so dissapointed after my first try at an In N Out near LAX maybe Arizona's In N Out's are just better? I think I had just gotten my own hopes up but whatever the reason was for it to be so bad; I swear after my second try I became addicted.   ",0.0,0.0
0,Double-Double; no sauce; cheese fries; diet root beer...  This is all I ever order at any In-N-Out (i loathe russian dressing)  This is where i go when I come to AZ to visit family.  What else is there to say about In-N-Out that hasn't been said??? An awesome place to get a cheeseburger.,0.0,0.0
0,How can you not LOVE a burger place where everything is FRESH! No freezers and a burger only costs $2!!!!  This location is great. They have a drive-thru that goes very fast. Often they have a person waiting to take your order instead of yelling it into a speaker box.   For a combo meal you can get a cheeseburger; fries & diet coke for $5 and some change.   The restrooms are clean and the service is very fast. There's plenty of parking & after you eat lunch; walk over to Yogurtland or Starbucks for dessert.,1.0,1.0

0,I know it seems ridiculous to not only take the time to review a chain corporately-owned restaurant as popular as Chipotle; but also to award it five entire stars; but I felt pretty strongly that I needed to.  Chipotle has been a long-time staple of my diet; and I have ventured to it; nationwide.  However; this location is by leagues the most consistent that I visit; and I go at least once a week; since it is local to both my office and my home.  Service is always quick; even during the weekday lunch rush; and I never have to call ahead.  Also; there is one fantastically sweet and positive employee who works the cash register; and considering that we have a conversation every time I'm in; I can't believe I don't know her name.  Whatever. The point is that I am always a Chipotle fan; but I know I'm going to have a hard time adjusting to a new neighborhood Chiptole when I leave this neighborhood... and when you find yourself saying that about a fast food restaurant; you know they've made a real impression.,1.0,0.0

0,I've only been here once so far and I thought it was a decent place.  I wasn't sure what to make of the sizes when I looked at the menu; but the burger I ended up ordering was humongous and probably the largest burger I can remember eating. I thought it was pretty good; although I'm not ready to call it a favorite just yet.,0.0,0.0
0,The food here is awesome!  This Location is convenient off of US 60. I eat here often when seeing a movie next door at AMC Mesa Grand 24.  I wanted to give this location 5 stars; but could not because I have not always had good service.  The service quality depends on when you eat at this location.  Usually the service is fast & friendly; but if you come here when the high school kids are working; service usually is ok at best; if even that good.  Overall very good except for a couple of times of rude service from the teenagers.  I reported the rude teenagers to the manager on another visit and he said he would look into the situation.  Service lately has been excellent.,0.0,1.0

0," Do your beans have lard in them?  \Uh; I don't know.\    (5-10 seconds go by with us awkwardly staring at each other) and I realize I'm going to have to inquire further.  Response included rolling the eyes; a shoulder shrug; and angrily muttering something in Spanish to the folks in the back.  Consensus is they don't really think so.  But; do we really have to endure people like this?  In customer service retail; you don't just stare back at someone and tell them you don't know.  /sigh  Location is easy to find in the Safeway parking lot.  The drive through is right by the two gigantic trash bins in the eastern part of the parking lot (the trash bins indicate they are for tenant's use only).  Food was similar to gringo-like Mexican chains such as Chevy's and On The Border; but prices were much better.  Rice and beans were plain; and beans portion was quite small with the combo (no more than 4-5 teaspoons).  Cheese Quesadilla was dry.  If you're dining in; get something to eat with your hands because the plastic silverware is among the most flexy and fragile I've seen.  They just don't hold up to a Chile Relleno.  Hot sauce served in ketchup squirt bottles.  It's also more of a \  medium sauce\   though.   ",0.0,0.0
0,Much prefer Ramiros!  Two times they have messed up my order.  :-(  This time; I order a side of rice (from 'sides' on the menu) & got a micro-side...like 2 tblspn.  Seriously!  They just don't seem to pay attention.,0.0,0.0
0,Was looking for another breakfast burrito option that was close to the house and stumbled on this place via Yelp. Ordered the Chorizo Special and Green Chili Burrito. Chorizo Special was OK. Would have been better if I liked my papas cooked like the culinary world says they should be cooked. I don't. I like soft papas. I couldn't really tell if the chorizo was spicy or not. Will get a regular chorizo burrito next time.  The Green Chili Burrito was excellent! Lots of filling and it was good.,0.0,0.0
0,I visited at lunch time; around 1:30 PM. I didn't think there would be much of a line given the time; but unfortunately there was no parking and the line was out the door. Once inside I realized why there was such a big line: the employees are less than the model of efficiency. After waiting 30 minutes in line; I was unlucky enough to have a lady in front of me who was filling an office order for 10 people. Why didn't she fax in her order you may be asking? Well; she was well aware of the process because she had the DSL (Don't Stand in Line) bulk order sheet in her hand and usd it to read the order to the burrito makers.  So by the time they finished her order; they were a bit flustered and in a hurry. I was ordering two burritos and was further unlucky to have a phone order prioritized between my two burritos. I had to walk back and forth along the counter to tell each person what I wanted on each burrito. That was why they forgot to include guac on my veggie burrito even though I asked for it; and why I didn't notice until it was too late.  I've ordered almost everything on their menu and off their menu and eating a veggie burrito with no guac was my first negative experience.  Am I blaming them for having to wait in line 40 minutes? No; I only blame them for 30 minutes of it. Why was the manager out clearing tables when only a couple tables were occupied and while there was only one burrito maker on the assembly line?  I may go back to this location; but only to get some free guacamole.,0.0,0.0
0,The only reason this location gets 2 stard is because i luv Chipotle! I use to have this at least 2 times a week; but now its way less; and the only reason is for the disorganization at this particular location! Like a few other yelpers have stated the service here sucks. On multiple trips i have waited in line for 30+ mins cuz they ran out of stuff on the line and just not efficient. I work in downtown and go to the location at cityscape and that is a model location. Lines are crazy long but the line is always moving. I was soo pissed one day cuz i waited and waited then they got my order wrong and gave me attitude when i mentioned the mistake; so i went online and wrote their corporate office. I basically stated they should look into this location cuz it could do soo much better. Gotta say i have been back to this chipotle and nothing has changed :( so if ur craving and dont wnt to deal drive to the one on 99th!,0.0,0.0
0,I really wanted to love this place; especially as they offered such a nice deal (BOGO) for teachers recently. But I didn't; and it had nothing to do with the service as other reviewers have mentioned. We did have to wait in line for about 45 minutes; but I know it was because of the teacher promotion; and I was happy to wait my turn. The portions are; indeed; massive - but the food was only so-so.   I was stoked that they had organic; hormone free chicken -- but was bummed that they were 'out' of it (and according to a friend; had been out of it for at least a month... due to a supply shortage?). Regardless; I ordered a double wrapped pork burrito and a chicken bowl. The chicken was really disgusting - super chewy; poorly cooked thighs; and the pork was slightly better but just tasted a little 'off'. The rice was slightly greasy;  and while the other toppings were ok; I went there for the meat; and having that be bad in both of my meals (I ordered one for the next day but tried them both that evening while they were fresh) just was a bit of a buzzkill. The place is also fairly pricey for a casual take out joint.   I doubt I'll go there again; but if I do for some reason; I'll try the vegetarian option and update this review accordingly.,0.0,0.0
0,We've been frequenting here for five years now and their food is always consistent.  Service is great.  My only complaint - well; there's 2 - is they are SUPER busy during lunch hours and the parking isn't so great.  If you go off peak; no problem.  As far as Chipotles go; this one definitely passes muster!,1.0,1.0
0,I've been here several times at it is always the same experience;  SUPER SLOW and less than good service. I try to eat by the Paleo plan; therefore I get no rice or beans here.  When you don't  order rice or beans (the huge filler ingredients) they look at you crazy here. I asked for a bunch of veggies and my steak. I received a pinch of veggies and  barely 1 scoop of meat. When I asked the lady for a little more of each I was told I'd have to pay extra. Stingy. I wasn't asking for extra; just a fair amount.  Not going back to this location.,0.0,0.0
0,Last time I visited; I placed an order online. I know; burned in the past; but thought I would give it a second shot. The online ordering site allows you to pick a time; and gives the people there at least fifteen minutes to get your order ready. I selected a time; and was at the store 5-10 minutes after the time it should have been ready. When I got up to the cash register; the girl there had to print out my receipt and hand it to the people making it. After a few words with them; they stuck the receipt with my order on the wall.   I had to stand there waiting another ten minutes before she went over there again; and had to tell the guy at the beginning of the line that I was there waiting for it.The place where I work only gives me a half hour for lunch; and the lines at this place are notoriously slow; so I thought I would be safe ordering online.   The food is definitely not as good as it used to be. In fact; the bowl I got was pretty watery. Not something I'm used to from chipotle.   All in all; I don't think I'll be going back. And I dont think I will miss it.,0.0,0.0
0,Visiting my brother in Gilbert; we had a large to-go order.  Nothing special here.  Hot; semi-crispy; moist; and flavorful.  Dipping sauce was better than the chicken.  This place blows away nasty places like Chik-Fil-A; but pales in comparison to similar fast-food offerings such as Popeyes.  Overall: AVERAGE.,0.0,1.0
0," This place came highly recommended by my foodie mates! And today; we finally had the chance to give their offerings a go!   We arrived at the drive through; and they offer; basically; deep fried chicken fingers. 1.09/small battered deep fried chicken finger.  The drive through intercom was muffled and loud. We had to repeat ourselves 4 times to order our food; 2 times to correct out order. We also told the food clerk that it's our first time here.  After we placed our order; we moved forward to pay at the window. The cashier looked as if we were bothering her with something. No greeting; no smile; and was not helpful at all when we asked her (what the order taker did not answer) what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. Our inquiry was; AGAIN; ignored and left unanswered.  After paying; we picked up our orders. We asked; AGAIN; what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. The response we got was \Thank you; have a nice day!\   We thanked the girl; but we asked the same question; AGAIN: what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. \  Ketchup!\   She said.   5 minutes later; we arrived at the flat. Opened our much anticipated recommended grub! We ordered 6 piece combo meal; 3 piece combo meal; and my 3  pieces of chicken fingers with Ketchup. There was 3 pieces of napkins for all orders; and one of their special sauce in a small container.  Overall; SERVICE was subpar based on our experience going through the drive through. FOOD; were greasy; fries were soggy and not thoroughly cooked; the *only* seasoning we all could taste was salt. Oh; and the bread was plain white bread... Toasted only on one side.  What a let down - pricey; bland; soggy; and most of all; bad bad service!   ",0.0,0.0
0,The chicken fingers were good but everything else was lackluster. The coleslaw was bland and the french fries were terrible. The french fries always get soggy and cold too quick when I eat to go. The last visit they also flat out forgot to provide the Texas toast in both the meals I ordered. I was pretty surprised because I saw the girl at the front counter check the meals before she put them in a bag. The quality needs to be more consist.,0.0,0.0
0,I came here orders the 3 finger combo..comes with 3 fried chicken fingers;  crinkle fries; and a piece of garlic bread. The chicken itself was really good just a little oiler than I would like but definitely 100x better than KFC. They only have chicken fingers and chicken sandwich so if you want something different this isn't the place for you. Plus they have some tailgate options with larger portions for parties. But I would definitely come back.,0.0,0.0
0," Food; 3 1/2 Stars.  Service; 1 star.  I have now gone through the drive thru twice and went inside to order out once.  You have shorted me on items I ordered Every time.  Yes; that is correct.  You have failed 100% of the time I have ordered something from you.    The first time I ordered (drive thru) a Caniac Combo and 1 extra chicken finger.  Wasn't till I nearly got home did I realize you did not give me my drink.  The second time I ordered (drive thru) a Caniac Combo and 2 extra chicken fingers.  Got my drink; but got home and no 2 extra chicken fingers.  :(  The third time I ordered (went inside to ensure I got what I ordered) a Caniac and two extra fingers to go.   I told the gal at the register that you had shorted me a drink one visit and two fingers the second visit and she told me; \Ya; that happens A LOT (extra emphases) here.  You really need to check your order before you go.\    I was floored  by the employee telling me I needed to double check your staffs work every time.  The truly sad part was she did not offer to give/comp me the two extra fingers I ordered even after telling her of my past experiences.  Not good customer service in my opinion.  Someone in a polo shirt walking around; asked how my order was going and I told him my past experiences.  He volunteered to give me two extra fingers on top of my order which was nice.  After receiving my order; I visually checked everything; and all my fingers were present and accounted for.  Walked out to my vehicle and realized holly cow you did it again.  Even after telling multiple people how my order has been short each time I have been there; YOU STILL DID NOT GIVE ME MY DRINK!  That's it.  3 visits; and each time I have been shorted even after speaking to what I can only assume is a shift lead or supervisor.  Please fix your staff training problems.  The things you are failing at are things my 7 year old has mastered.  He can read a list (receipt in your case) and make sure everything on that list is present.  Why can't you?      Please respond to this posting.  I would love to hear a response from your management team.   ",0.0,0.0
0,I am a chicken lover; all types and varieties. I also have eaten more fast food in my life than is medically advisable. This is the zenith of both avenues. Raising Cane's has a chicken finger that is simple; yet executed flawlessly. The menu makes In N Out's menu look complex by comparison. It's simple: you want tasty chicken fingers fast? Here you go.   The breading on the chicken is thin and provides just enough flavor so that you enjoy it but the chicken is still the main emphasis.  The fries are also thin crispy crinkle cut masterpieces; a perfect complement.    The staff is also always excited for you to be a customer but not awkwardly over involved with you. The balance is actually quite well done: fast service with a strong attitude of making sure I am happy with the chicken.  Not how people don't rate this five stars; simple; fast; tasty. It's worth the trip every time.  Maybe the only negative people get cranky about is because it's so popular the drive through often wraps around the building....but you can already see why that would be a good thing right? If people are waiting in the drive through 10 minutes to get it clearly it's a high quality product.,1.0,1.0
0,I love Weinerschnitzel; but this location is FAIL.  I went in with a coupon for lunch as I was working down by ASU that day. I placed my order to find out that it would have just been cheaper if I had ordered the combo instead; but then discovered that on top of it all the clerk rang me up wrong. This isn't usually a big deal; so I just asked that they correct my order to the pretzel bun chili dogs that I enjoy so very very much.  Short version of the story was that the manager was rude and I had to swipe my card again for another 60-something cents for the pretzel bun upgrades. A good manager would have just done it for having screwed up my order but he copped an attitude with me as well.   Maybe he mistook me for an ASU student trying to cause him trouble and not; you know; a paying customer. Who knows.  Just make sure you speak slowly and make them read your order back to you (TWICE) and you should be fine.,0.0,0.0

0," We came as a dine-in and the cashier taking our order is the same one taking the drive-thru orders; so while ordering our food we kept getting interrupted. We went for the classic hot dogs and (unknowinglt) they since added a new beef hot dog which we picked. We weren't given the option for cheese so we received shredded cheese. After realizing the all beef all hotdog wasn't the original; we asked and were told about the original hotdog was different so we ordered another hotdog and also asked about the cheese; we were told it was the original cheese was american sliced cheese (in which we weren't given that option). So after we finally thinking we got our \original\   hotdog; it had some bad tasting wheat bun??? Yuck... we were disappointed with the changes and won't be eating here again.   ",0.0,0.0

The service was quick and friendly and the restaurant is good-sized with the right amount of tables so you don't feel cramped.  The menu is very diverse and I love the \make your own salad\   or \  burger\   selection that each had a ton of different options. Their portions are very large and can easily be shared or taken home for a lunch or another dinner.  I made my own salad with solid albacore tuna with their fresh veggies and the balsamic dressing on the side. Everyone's order was correct and prompt and prices were great. For 7 people who had dinner; some had appetizers and everyone had tea or soda; it was just under $100. We are making this our standard place for our monthly meetings now.   ",1.0,1.0

The prices are very reasonable; and the menu is very extensive offering everything from salads to appetizers and everything in between such as burgers and healthy sandwiches. I had the Pinnacle chicken sandwich and it was absolutely scrumptious...I ordered mine in ciabatta bread and it came with lettuce; tomato; cheese; bacon and avocado.  The service was very friendly and efficient and certainly didn't miss a beat. They also have a lovely patio and serve breakfast. Highly recommended. Will return without a doubt.,1.0,1.0

I decided to give the place a try. My hamburger was absolutely superb.  The bun was very fresh (Perhaps they make them there) The large angus patty was cooked to the medium rare I ordered; and the side salad was large and had a nice variety of greens and other salad ingredients.The service was superb.  The meal was appropriately priced.  I am not from Arizona; but would definitely return to this place.,1.0,1.0
0,For the most part the menu is divided into three sections; appetizers; soups and salads; and burgers and sandwiches. This is not your average burger joint however! The choices are enormous for all of the categories and if that was not enough the burger section is truly build your own from the type of burger (13 types to choose from including non-meat selections); 8 kinds of buns; cheese; toppings; sauces; and more.  Fortunately they do offer prebuilt selections as well and I went for the Pinnacle Salmon burger which turned out to be the most amazing salmon burger I have ever tasted -- period. Before the burger I had a cup of the Kickin' Crab Corn Chowder which was wonderful -- but a cup? What they call a cup would be a bowl in any place I am used to.  In general the portions are very large considering the prices and our table over ordered selecting a couple of appetizers to try as well. The Chips & Guacamole are very good; the Tomato & Mozzarella is outstanding; and the Pinnacle Fries are awesome.  It seems that most places that try to be incredibly flexible with their menus and are generous with their portions compromise somewhere on quality to get there. The Pinnacle Grill; however; seems to be an exception where quality; flexibility; and quantity come together in a truly amazing combination. If you are anywhere in the area do make this a stop - you will certainly be glad you did.,0.0,1.0

Ordered dinner as usually with a calamari appetizer; the calamari was cold ( partial frozen) and we made this obvious to are waiter who acted unconvinced. The owner who was present completely ignored us and we actually had to request to the waiter that we would not pay for the appetizer when the bill arrived.

Anywho; the manager/owner is always working and he isn't always behind the register; he's actually picking up and greeting everyone in the establishment; I love that! Crazy concept but interacting with your customers; brings them back. Aside from the service; their food is literally always fresh and to order. I've never had any overcooked food; or old/stale vegies. It's in a great location and just very convenient.  Personally I always go for the burrito bowl; but they have lots of alternaties and especially for the vegietarians/vegans.,1.0,1.0

0," Is a Chipotle; a Chipotle; a Chipotle?    Which translated means: yes; yes; and YES -- you are about to have a great meal!  First; avoid this place between 11:30 am to 1:30 pm; unless you are into pain; or have a death wish.  Like Five Guys and Jimmy Johns next door; the parking lot can become very crowded and somewhat of a mess.    I tend to leave my car at the office and walk across Scottsdale Road playing Frogger with the cars.  A good suggestion to avoid some of this is to order online.  Most App Stores offer a downloadable \Chipotle Ordering\   application which makes it easier.  But after that; stop by and pickup a delicious Burrito; Taco or Bowl of goodness!   If you order anything; make sure you include the Guacamole and Chips.  You would have to go to Mexico to get anything fresher; or for that matter better.  Enjoy!   ",0.0,0.0
0,Not my first choice; but went there to be with friends.  No complaints. Bright; clean; well organized; and well maintained.

The lettuce is good quality.  Good quality food and service.  Solid.,1.0,1.0
0,This Chipotle went above and beyond. I feel that it is too common today for big companies not to take care of their customers; but to give them a product as cheap as possibly while quality and service suffer. I never find that to be the case with Chipotle and especially at this location. I am moving to a new apt and after being mistreated and robbed from Direct TV and Century Link among many others. I felt as if no large company actually valued their customers anymore. This Chipotle ended my day a little better by proving me wrong. I requested steak for my burrito which they were momentarily out of. I had to wait literally less than a minute for the steak to finish being prepared. Because of my brief wait Chipotle comped my meal. Shit if I ordered something from a traditional fast food restaurant it still would have taken longer than the 2 minutes it took to make my burrito. I understand this isn't something Chipotle will do every time in this situation. But I have always had a great experience at Chipotle so on top of that today they reminded me; not only do we put out a great; fast product; we also give a fuck! Thank you to the crew working tonight at 8:30!,1.0,1.0

0,Horrible chiptole.  Parking lot is a hazard; I've almost had a few accidents here.  The parking lot is way to small for the amount of traffic this place gets.  This location is pretty much always crowded and long lines.  The service is subpar.  I've had a few instances when I would call my order in ahead of time and I would walk upto the cash register only to have the lady help 5 people before I can pay for my order.  Rural and baseline location is much better and far less people.,0.0,0.0
0,I am always impressed by the chipotle chain. I came in around lunch time and there was a line to the door but I waited only 3 minutes (at most) to order. Customer service is still great even at the fast pace they are working at. Some of the food is a bit spicy for my taste but I love the barbacoa and guacamole!!,1.0,1.0
0,I will never understand why places like Chipotle (even Taco Bell) who have all the food precooked; and all the server has to do is scoop it into a tortilla or dish and wrap it up; can still manage to work so slowly as to get their line backed up for 15 minutes with only a few people in it (as if I'm at a Subway)!   I am not at all prejudiced against hippydreadlock folk based on appearance; but the rasta chick happened to be the problem this night; since she was moving in slow motion like she was blazed off of her gourd.  I don't understand why I can get as much salsa as I want; on the side in a cup; with my burrito and there's no charge; but as soon as I order a bag of tortilla chips then i HAVE TO pay for that same cup of salsa.  Still good food when it's what you're in the mood for; but this particular Chipotle loses a star for gross incompetence.,0.0,0.0
0,I am an avid Chipotle-er and I have been disappointed with this location on four separate visits! Dirty; slow line. One time the pico de gallo was so spicy I could barely eat it (and I like spicy!). They opened 10 minutes late one day and I spent my lunch break waiting for the doors to open... had to leave to make it back to work before I even got to order. During another visit; I waited five minutes for the fajitas to be made (they were close to raw!) on a Saturday around dinner time and watched the two people on the line bicker and mis-communicate through orders. The line stretched to the door. I was told the guacamole would take 20 minutes to make. No offer was made to make up for these shortcomings.,0.0,0.0
0,Chipotle is a godsend for my little area of Phoenix; where it seems quite difficult to eat vegetarian unless I cook at home. While there always seems to be a line out the door; it moves faster than you'd think. On top of that; the food is awesome! I have never once been disappointed with my food and neither has anyone that I have exposed Chipotle to. For having such a small and specific selection of items; the set-up is great and possibilities seem endless. I love that the meat served here is natural; meaning no hormones and better taste! The atmosphere is cozy; clean and simple.  The only reason I had to give this place only 4 stars is due to service. When you go thru the line and the staff asks you what what you would like on your salad; tacos or burrito; they ask as they are already spooning it on. On more than half occasions here they have had to remove ingredients or redo my food; but they never mind having to do the correction. So if you see a topping that you would prefer not to have; my advice is to scream it out before your food makes its way even remotely close to the item. I can promise you won;t be disappointed with your end result; though.......always yummy!,0.0,0.0

0,Went on Tuesday night was waiting for a friend to fly in from Tampa. Her plane was late and  had some time to kill so went here since it was close to the hotel. I had the chicken burrito with pinto beans and rice. For a little extra I had the guacamole and it was worth it. A bag of chips; salsa; and a beer and I had the makings of a great dinner. I usually have the carnitas but the chicken tasted like it was fresh off the BBQ grill.  These burritos are huge! The service was great and the tables are clean. Check out this place when you are in the Metroplex area.,1.0,1.0
0,When it comes to the quality of the food; all locations are the same... good. However; not all locations are equal in their level of service or consistency in product. This is by far the best location of the two other nearby. The people are friendly. We eat here often enough that many of the employees know it's and recognize us when we come in. They know what we order and are always pleasant. At most other locations you have to fuss at them to put more than five grains of five and two beans in your bowl; but not here. The only time they get a little stingy is when they are busy; so it is more out of being rushed than anything else. If you're coming for dinner you need to be here slightly before five or after seven. All other times there will be a considerable line.,0.0,0.0
0," I wish I could give a ZERO STAR review for this place to further emphasize how much it is in your best interests to take your pizza craving to another business. To save you time: Skip this place.  There's a ton of other GOOD pizza places in this area that care about taking your order correctly.  Today I ordered a salad; a pizza; and a 2-Liter for myself and a co-worker.  We had never tried this place before and; since I like new things; I decided to go for it.  When I ordered; I did it with specific instructions: 
o dressing for the salad\   and \  pepperonis on all of the pizza; mushrooms only on one half.\    I didn't want a pizza my co-worker couldn't eat (she doesn't like mushrooms).  I placed the order and was told it would be here in 15-20 minutes.  I work relatively close to the location; so it seemed plausible.  Fastforward ONE HOUR after the end of the call.  If I had known this was going to happen; I would have just called Pizza Hut because; let me tell you; food triggers some emotions.  Normally; I don't notice when things are taking long while I'm working; but if I have to call and ask where my food is; you're taking way too damn long.  About 15 minutes after I call to ask where it is; the driver shows up at my door.  The pizza box looks like something heavy had been sitting on it and the guy gives me a crumpled receipt; but whatever; the food got here.  I honestly have never had to check my pizza before the driver leaves; but I should have.  First of all; all of the toppings are on one side and the other side is completely cheese.  The pizza is cold and; as another co-worker put it; \  has no gravy.\    He meant sauce; but damn if he wasn't right.  I check on the salad I got and aside from the sad; old tomatoes in it... they added a side of dressing.  I explicitly said I didn't want any since I never use it and didn't want them to waste it on me.  I detest wasting food; so aside from screwing up my order; taking an unreasonable amount of time; and the general shitty state of the food; I've reached my limit of patience with this place.  Which wasn't high to begin with; mind you.  I immediately call back and make my list of complaints.  The guy who answered was the person who had taken my order; and tried to say that I had asked for one side to be mushrooms and pepperoni with the other side just cheese.  At no point had I even mentioned the *word* cheese during our conversation; and the fact that he tried to pin it on me pissed me off to no end.  That is a poor business model.  I understand miscommunications; but for him to try to cover his own ass and make it a problem from my end is absolutely unprofessional.  The result in that conversation ended with a \  five dollar credit to my account.\    Right.  Like I'd make that mistake more than once.  A-V-O-I-D!  tl;dr: Order got messed up; customer service tried to make it seem like I screwed up.  Pizza sucked; salad was old; the only thing that came out right was the soda.   ",0.0,0.0
0," Worst customer experience I have ever received from a restaurant. I work for a company that deals with Value Card Alliance and this place accepts our Valued Card scripts. However; you cannot place a order on the phone with Value Card. They will force you to go into their location to place an order due to past customers have complained about how long the wait is when ordering on the phone. Phone orders are so customers do not have to sit and wait at a location for their food. I asked to speak with the manager regarding this and the lady said \I'm in charge!\   I asked her to explain why I can't order on the phone if using Value Card due to it is just like paying with cash. All the \  manager\   said was \  people who use Value Card take too long to come pick up their orders and it is annoying to hear them complain about it being cold due to them not picking up on time.\   If you are going to offer for phone orders and give a customer a time frame to pick it up; if the cost shows up after the time frame that is the customers fault. That does not mean you should deny a customer from ordering. Also when I told the \  manager\   I'd just pay with cash then she was EXTREMELY rude on the phone. Never have I ever ordered from a restaurant and receive such poor customer experience. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!! If you want great pizza with great customer experience ESPECIALLY for a business that deals with Value Card I recommend you going to Rosati's Pizza on 40th St and Thomas. They take all orders on the phone and extremely friendly especially to businesses.   ",0.0,0.0

0,Okay; I was super excited about this place when I finally realized what it was while we were in the drive-through.  I wasn't excited however about their complicated menu.  I did the build your own combo thing and I just wanted a single patty cheeseburger with bacon on it.  I got the cheese curds as a side because... well how could I not.  Fried cheese.  After pulling past the pay window we waited for a good 7-10 minutes for our food.  That was irritating.  I like the whole made-to-order thing; but Jack In the Box manages to do it faster.  I gobbled up all my cheese curds within moments.  Ya; they were really good.  There was a mix of white and yellow cheese in there.  The flavor of them was just delicious.  Unfortunately; my burger was all sorts of wrong.  I opened the wrapping to find a ridiculously misshapen double cheeseburger inside.  I wanted one less patty and some bacon.   I guess that was too much to ask.  Anyway; it looked unappetizing based off of the strangely shaped patties and the fact that it was so greasy I couldn't get my hands to grip it without crap falling out the other end.  I probably wouldn't go back unless I was just getting a snack.  The cheese curds are great; but that's about it.,0.0,0.0
0,Based on one slightly unfair visit due to an unruly 3yr old demanding ice cream.   I ordered 'two of those on the picture out the front'; meaning the scrumptious looking specimens on the boards before you enter. Unfortunately; the cashier didn't quite know what I meant - my own fault for not being specific I guess......but then what was served-up were two plops of 'frozen' custard (strawberry and chocolate) - there were supposed to be m&m's in both; but we ended up with double in the chocolate - with that much in the pot; it was inedible (nearly broke a tooth); whilst the strawberry version was a tasteless mess. I didn't have time to have a famous burger; and the frozen custard was not really what I was expecting.....  Decor was nice for a chain; sport on the tv was a plus. Maybe next time I'll have more time to sample other stuff; and will change the scoring appropriately.,0.0,0.0
0,OMG!  I had the caramel cashew frozen custard!  I would give up Fenton's black and tan for this. Yes; you heard me right!  The cashews are bit salted so you get that salt and sweet taste.  This past weekend I went to the a place that served frozen custard in Willow Glen and it didn't EVEN come close.      *Chicken cashew salad - grilled to order chicken; sugar snap peas; grape tomatoes; cucumbers; iceberg lettuce and spring greens.  This THE best fast food salad I ever had.  *Fish and chips - It's the BEST fish and chips I every had - even compared to a restaurant!  The batter wasn't thick.  It was light and crispy and not oily.  The fish was soooo juicy and moist.  It wasn't fishy at all.    Tried the Culver's in Phoenix and it wasn't as nearly as good.  I can't wait until I go to back !!!!,0.0,0.0

0,Ive only been here once; but it'll probably be my last. Nothing special about this place. I ordered a burger; fries and a coke and it cost me around $10. The food was good; but if im paying over 10 bucks for a burger combo i want a happy ending before i walk out the door. I would suggest trying it once and see if you fall in love with the place; but for me; its not worth the price. i would just as soon go to in n out.,0.0,0.0
0,An alright burger joint with peanuts galore.  They use peanut oil for everything. I ordered a hamburger; reg Cajun fries; and reg drink; totaling at $10.   Result; I got a burger with double hand made patties with onions mushrooms pickles etc sandwiched with a sesame seeded set of buns. Reminds me of well crafted homemade burger. It was good but for the price in and out burgers knocks five guys out of the competition. Delicious regardless and I'd eat again.,0.0,0.0
0,Five Guys is pretty new on the scene on Mill and fits in very well with the college style and crowd that it will cater to.  This place is by no means a gourmet restaurant; but they put out decent food at a decent price. The inside is very well lit and very clean with white tiled walls with red highlights and free peanuts for snacking on.  Service is quick and friendly with food being made as it is ordered. My burger was well cooked; but not dry and overdone; well prepared and still juicy.  The toppings are very fresh and can be picked to suit with a large variety.  Being able to just pick and choose your toppings to your heart's desire is kind of a neat aspect of this place and gives the customer the ability to customize their burger.  The fries were the weakest part of the meal since they were a bit on the soggy side and left room for improvement.  I did like the choice of regular fries or cajun; which gave the fries a bit more flavor and taste and actually bumped up fries a bit.  However; I really like my fries to be a bit more crispy and less soggy/limp.,1.0,1.0

One hot dog please! What would you like on it? BACON! and?... Wow; tons to choose from!!! I'll have onions; mustard and JALAPENOS!  My friends ordered a burger and a grilled cheese and I sat back and watched as the \guys\   made all our food from scratch.  Everything was tasty and the fries were IMHO perfect.

Besides the odd addition of peanuts; the menu is very basic like an In and Out Burger....but about 3 times the price!  The menu doesn't say anywhere that the regular burger has 2 patties....which would be helpful when ordering for someone that isn't trying to practice for a food eating competition!  The burgers tasted good; but they weren't anything special that I would go back for.

This is the first place where I saw the cool soda machine that I've now seen in a few other places.  But I love that you can pick your own drinks from so many different flavors!  Although; I get cherry sprite every time!  Yum!!!  Every time I have been here; there's always been good seating and everything has been clean.

0," The pros definitely outweigh the cons; but let's start with the cons just because it's more fun.  1. The scary tweakers RIGHT outside. Real entertaining to watch through the windows at first; but I noticed a lot of children in the restaurant staring out there; and heard one say she was scared; so that's no fun for anybody. But; because that has nothing to do with Five Guys as a company; only their scary surroundings; I didn't take away any stars for that. I just wanted to mention it because I'd want someone to mention it to me. :)  2. I took away the star because there is something fundamentally wrong with the french fries.

I think the buns are utter buns\   and the burgers are made right there when you order them so they're super fresh.  4. There's a pretty dope coke machine that distributes a plethora of teas; lemonades; sodas; you name it.  Not much else to say... it's a burger joint. :)   ",1.0,1.0

0," Below is a general review of the two AZ locations I have been to; and at the bottom will be notes specific to this location...  This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.  But if you like a burger that was made when you order it or fries that are real potatoes and don't taste like the cup they came in then this place could be a great option.  They are a little pricier than your average quick service joint; but its worth it.  The portions are HUGE; even if you order the egular\   fries and the \  little\   burger they are still BIG.  They don't charge per topping beyond the norm like Smashburger; and they have tons of toppings to choose from.  Would love to see a fried egg option; but other than that the majority of burger loving taste buds will find topping options that please them.  They have some non-burger choices as well; which is nice.  Hot dogs; grilled cheese (which people keep saying is a must try) and a veggie sandwich.  Eating here is a 5 napkin type experience; a lil messy; a lil crazy; but oh so yummy!  Hint: if you are transporting 5 guys in your car; definitely put something between the bag and your (clothes; passenger seat; floor mat; etc..)  the grease WILL leak through the bag.   I agree with a below post that the placement of peanut snacking boxes are a little awkward  (and frankly I don't get why they exist at all; but whatever)  TEMPE Location Specific:  Could have just been the day I was here; but their Mr. Pibb tastes better than most places... who knows; perhaps they clean the machine well!  Parking is a bit of a challenge; it is on mill ave so it is meter parking and limited meter parking.  Mostly parallel; but next to American Apparel there are some standard metered spots as well.  Regardless; make sure you have change if you will be parking to go to grab your burger!   ",0.0,0.0
0,Walking in to Five Guys; I was rather excited; and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before; so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud; at least. The music was classic rock; which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes; someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day; not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order; one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out; but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.  Much to my dismay; they did not offer Dr. Pepper; my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks; but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes; my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside; not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries; which were in a cup; and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special; and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor; but there was simply too much salt. As a result; in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large; I finished only about half of my fries.  Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal; so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping; I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing; at all. Almost disgusting; as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun; and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite; it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste; I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's.   Upon finishing my meal; I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy; and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times; which I did; as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it; it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall; Five Guys is way to expensive; unbelievably greasy; and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though; thus the two stars.   If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out; INO is the clear winner in every category.,0.0,0.0

It's a little bit pricier for a meal; but I definitely think it's way more worth it than getting a burger from mcdonald's or burger king.

0,This review is long overdue and could have been written well over a year ago!  You won't find truffle oil; baby arugula or bleu cheese crumbles here. What you will find is a great; honest burger with any of the basics one might desire. I've been here a few times and the burgers as well as the Italian beef are excellent.  The owner is cool and there more times than not.  They use really good beef and it shows in the final product.  The other ingredients are fresh and tasty as well. The place itself is nice; clean and the staff have always been friendly. They cook to order right in front of you; on a flat top; so no surprises! Fries are crinkle cut and good.  I'm usually not a fan of the crinkle cut; but Lobby's are tasty! Will I go again; absolutely!,1.0,1.0

0,Lobby; Lobby; Lobby you spoiled me.  Your burgers are so good.  I walked in and was instantly warmly greeted at the counter.  The young man took my order with a smile and sense of humor.  I love that!  I ordered a bacon chesse burger with provolone.  When I unwrapped it I knew I had found near perfection.  The burger was on a fresh sesame bun; the bacon was nice and crisp but not over done and the cheese.....oh the cheese.....it was melted over the burger.  9 times out of 10 when you get a cheese burger it looks like they just slapped the cheese on right before they put the rest of the toppings on so it's not melted.  In my mind the cheese should be melted down the sides of the burger; not an afterthought to be slapped on at the last minute.  I took a bite and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly; just a tiny bit pink inside.  Ahhhh!!  I also got crinkle cut fries and they were perfectly cooked as well and not greasy at all.  Lobby's has a secret sauce....you must get a side of the secret sauce to dip your fries in....YUM!!!  The soda cups are a generous size and free refills are included.    The whole place was clean and well lit.  You can see them cooking too.  Lobby; yes that is his real name; was there running the show and making sure his customers were happy.  I hear the Italian Beef sandwich is to die for so I will try that next.  I'm gonna have to psych myself into it though cause that burger was so darn good!    Thank you Lobby!!!  I'll be back soon!!,1.0,0.0
0,Upon my second visit to Lobby's I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich.  WOW!  Go hungry if you're gonna get this one cause it is HUGE!  And it's really more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Oh sure; you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time.  The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.    Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile; willingness to help if I have questions; and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair; I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless; again; a big plus for me.    When I crave a burger; this is what I crave.  A real beef patty with fresh ingrediants; cheese; and sometimes bacon.  This is by far my favorite burger joint.  Support your locan businesses!!

0,Upon my second visit to Lobby's I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich.  WOW!  Go hungry if you're gonna get this one cause it is HUGE!  And it's really more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Oh sure; you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time.  The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.    Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile; willingness to help if I have questions; and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair; I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless; again; a big plus for me.

0," I think it's funny that places like this are creating such a splash in the local food scene. Lobby's excels at being an average burger joint by using high quality; fresh ingredients. It's the kind of place that once was common; but was replaced in the last 20 years by novel and trendy restaurant concepts of other sorts. Or; for a more modern reference; imagine if Fudrucker's got rid of its ambiance and added a Chicago twist with its Italian beef; Polish sausage; and Chicago dogs.  Lobby's is very proud of its caramelized onions (apparently; they have a magical way of making a crispy white onion brown and soft). When I asked about getting sauerkraut on a Polish sausage; the owner insisted that he too loves sauerkraut; but the onions are sooooooo much better: \Just look! We grill them right here;\   he says; pointing at the grill. In other words; they do not offer sauerkraut.   And then there's the secret sauce. It's pink! And when offered as a dipping sauce for the otherwise mediocre school-cafeteria-style fries; it's made a little bit spicy with chili powder or something of the sort. Again; total magic!  Just so that I don't sound too let down; I will say that the buns make the burgers above average at Lobby's. Good idea not to skimp on the buns. As you walk in; you get the sense that this place should have a drive thru and charge $2-3 per burger; but the burgers are more comparable to pub fare. And apparently people love Lobby's. My three stars are below average; and the owner drives a Mercedes when he's not happily engaging in chit chat with his customers -- they're apparently doing well enough and I would frequent this place if it were in my neighborhood.  So if you're ever craving a burger and fries in Tempe; I would say skip the In-N-Out and go here instead. But for hot dogs? Granted; I'll never understand the whole Chicago dog craze; but this place is right near Ted's.... The only way I'm ordering a dog other than Ted's in the area is if it's wrapped in bacon and prepared Sonoran style. Sorry; Lobby's. Also; your onions are pretty much the same as anyone else's caramelized onions. I still want sauerkraut on my Polish sausage.   ",0.0,0.0
0,Never coming here again. Manager/owner took my order and apparently put in the wrong item. My order is called and it's the wrong item.  No big deal. Just make the correct burger. It didn't end there though. I was expected to pay the $1 and some change difference between a bacon burger and a double burger. Are you serious!? This wasn't my mistake it was yours. The manager/owner said this is a business I have to charge you. Not cool and I will be sure to tell all my friends and family to never come here again. Absolutely terrible business practices to make a customer pay more for your mistake. Especially for a $1 and some change. And one more thing I noticed as I was writing this. It got worse. Not only was I expected to pay more but I ordered a double burger and then was charged the difference for a double bacon burger. I was overcharged! Yet another item I didn't order. Holy cow this place is terrible!,0.0,0.0
0,Being a native Chicagoan my interest was piqued. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean. Ordered a Chicago style hot dog the hot dog was grilled;Chicago style is steamed as is the bun but the bun was wet and therefore was a soggy pastry mess; the fries were mediocre at best ; the dipping sauce was very good.  Needs some changes in the food preparation and pray that Portillos does not open in the area.,1.0,1.0
0," The website boasts 100% Grass-fed Iowa beef; the prices were reasonable and the delivery guy was very nice and personable. The rest of my experience was absolutely awful. First off; the delivery service is run through another company. Who outsources delivery drivers? Evidently these folks do; and you pay for it with patience and money. We ordered three of the same burgers (bacon burgers with added cheddar); and modified one to have no onion and no sauce. We also ordered one order of cheese fries with added peppers; and two plain orders of fries on the side. The website was fickle and we had to put in the correct combinations of \Letter-perfect\   street addresses; which was aggravating but manageable. Our order showed up precisely on time; the delivery guy looked stressed and hands over a half-soaked white bag covered in what he claims is cheese sauce and says \  The fries busted.\   So I scurry off to the kitchen with our food to inspect the damages and the cheese fries are fine; the cheese sauce couldn't have run all over the inside of the bag because it was ice cold. Anyone who has handled cold cheese sauce knows it's like salty silly putty when it's cold. No; it is in fact the sauce from the burger that nobody ordered on the side. We just plain didn't want the burger sauce; but we got in anyway; all over our entire order. The delivery guy calls the restaurant and tells them what happened; they say they will replace the entire order but that it will take another hour to get back to us. We called the restaurant and the girl who picked up the phone was rude; abrupt and blamed the delivery guy for throwing the food around. He blamed her for packaging it badly. She showed no care or concern for our complaint and couldn't get us off the phone fast enough. We asked to speak to a manager and she says \  I can take a message\  . Oh; so now the underpaid help is fielding complaints for the manager or is it that she has no intention of doing anything about it but wiping her a** with the complaint slip? I think it's the latter. She really was the most awful representative for a dining establishment I have ever encountered. I have bar-tended and served in high end and low end restaurants for ten years and I have to say; she has NO business being in the food business. She should be relieved of her *obviously* so-stressful position at the front counter of Lobby's burgers and fries. Then; when we hang up with that one; the manager calls us and sensing that he is unable to make things right as they have gone so so terribly wrong; he hangs up on us! Awesome customer service abounds here! So yes; what little corner I could taste of the burger was absolutely delicious; though 99.9% of it went right in the trash. I wish I had gotten an edible order so we could have enjoyed all of it. It's sad; really; a whole meal wasted because someone put sauce in a bag that we didn't even want. I would consider trying it again; but the girl on the phone; the manager and the delivery service make me really think twice before going back.   ",0.0,0.0
0,A burger joint is a burger joint is a burger joint right? Wrong. Not when it is done right. This joint does it right. The burgers are made with quality ingredients which makes them tasty and juicy. I had a chili cheese burger that was flavorful without being too salty or oily (have them put their hot giardiniera on it; makes a big difference). I ordered it as a combo with fries and a soda for around $8. Not a bad deal. So if you are looking for a burger joint above the mondane; pay the extra couple of bucks it will be worth it.,0.0,1.0

I had lunch here with my wonderful wife; my youngest daughter and my friend Donald S (not to be confused with Don S...it has happened).  Let me just say I was impressed with my burger and fries.  Cheesy fries.  With bacon. Tender and juicy burger.  Done just right.  Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's; which will be soon.  Maybe dinner today.  We did chat with the owner; Lobby.  Nice guy; great local business.  Go here.   ",1.0,1.0
0,I am not a hot dog person at all.  I've had 3 hot dogs in the past 5 years but since finding the Chicago dog I've had 3 hot dogs in 2 months.  The French fries are great and the drink sizes are huge.  A little pricey for a hot dog; fries and a drink but the quality is great; service is good and the place is very clean.    I recommend checking them out if you are a hot dog or hamburger fan.  Be prepared to wait longer than at a fast food joint because they do make them Fresh.,1.0,1.0
0,I've now made three trips to Lobby's.  The first was an enormous disappointment; the last two have been exceptional.  On my first trip; I made the mistake of ordering the Italian beef sandwich.  What I received could best be described as a thinly-sliced beef sandwich on a baguette that some jerk spilled soup on.  My sandwich was soggy to the point of disintegration from the moment I received it.  I tend to be a very neat eater; but felt I needed a bib that day.  In addition to the mess; the whole assemblage was bland and unremarkable.    However...  I'd happily recommend Lobby's to anyone who wants a burger.  Upon hearing great things about their hamburgers; I returned to Lobby on two more occcasions.  On both days; I got a ridiculously large; juicy burger with great quality beef and fresh ingredients for a price around half of their competitors (I'm looking at you; Smashburger and Five Guys).    So; go for the burgers and read the menu carefully: the single patty burger is 1/3 pound.  If you order the double; you're ordering more than a half-pound of beef and you will need a nap.,0.0,0.0

0,After reading the reviews; I thought we would give this place a try.  Definitely the BEST italian sandwich I have had in years!  The sandwich was everything you want in an italian sandwich; the meat was tender; juicy and flavorful.  I had mine 'wet' or dipped and added grilled onions and sweet peppers.  Not only was the sandwich delicious but chock full of meat and lots of sweet peppers and grilled onions!  I ordered a single burger just to try it.  BIG mistake!  It was sooo good I had to finish it and I was stuffed!  Black tea was great and mixed with the lemonade made a great Arnold Palmer.  French fries were very very good!  My girlfriend loved them.

You want real Chicago-style food; great service AND great prices? Well; look no further! THIS is where you need to go. I tried the bacon burger with the works Saturday; & it was the best burger I have had in months. Today I got their Italian beef ... This beats Portillo's by a landslide ... The fries are the best; and try a milkshake; too; you won't be disappointed since it's made with fresh strawberries ... OMG pure Chicago heaven. Bringing a friend from back home (Chicago) there for lunch tomorrow and I think I will either get a chili dog or a Chicago dog ... & another strawberry shake. And I met the owner today (yes; he's from Chi-town) ... What a great guy! Hats off to you; Lobby!! :)   ",1.0,0.0
0,This place ROCKS!!! It specializes in Chicago fast food such as burgers and sausages; the prices were good and the place was clean.

I had the Italian sausage with sweet peppers and onions - I will be back! 5 stars - Solid!,1.0,1.0
0,Once again; Yelp comes through for me. I hadn't had an Italian Beef/Sausage Combo for a while; and Lobby's served me up a fantastic one. I ordered mine dipped and sweet; and it was like I had been magically transported to my old neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago. A wonderfully delicious and marvelously messy piece of culinary heaven on earth. The crinkle-cut fries complimented it perfectly; and there were plenty more than I could be comfortable eating.  They hit the nail right on the head with this; and I'll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings.,0.0,0.0
0,Dang; this place makes a good burger. I went here last night for the first time; because the boyfriend was craving a burger and Lobbys was the random place he picked out on Yelp. I wasn't expecting much; but holy cow - this was probably the best take out burger I'd ever had. Delicious; generously sized burger with loads of toppings. The grass-fed beef makes a difference. And it was so big! I had that burger around 7pm and wasn't hungry again until; like; 2pm today.   Now; normally my boyfriend and I don't eat so much fast food; but we've been doing a lot of Christmas-related chores this week; running all around town; and we ended up hungry this afternoon while out doing errands. We'd skipped breakfast; and that caught up with us. So when looking for a late lunch; where did we go again? Yes.. back to Lobbys.   I'm not proud of the fact that 100% of my meals within a 16 hour period were burgers. And before going into Lobbys for the second time today; I desperately hoped it wasn't the same people working the counter as had been there last night; so I wouldn't have an audience to my shame. No such luck - same crew exactly. And the guy behind the register totally recognized us (he had helpfully explained the whole punch card promo they run there). But my shame of ordering two of these burgers in less than 24 hours was completely overwhelmed by my carnivorous need for another one of these burgers. They are that delicious.   Thank you Lobbys; for those shamefully delicious burger-filled 16 hours of my life.,1.0,1.0
0," Tuesday; 5:30 pm  My buddy and I waltz into Lobby's because he was jonesin' for a burger and didn't want to fight the lines at In-N-Out.  Why; you ask; is Liz B. writing a review for a burger and hot dog joint when she freely admits that she has never liked meat and her parents even paid her to eat burgers as a child? Think of this as a review of French fries; Chris's burger; and my \veggie\   sandwich and skip this review if you love hot dogs/burgers more than anything.  Service: We were quickly greeted by the two guys behind the counter. Great; friendly service.  Food: Meh. My veggie sandwich consisted of bread; one piece of white iceberg lettuce; two sad tomatoes; pickles; and onions for $2.99. You can add on cheese (provolone) and mushrooms or peppers for $.79 each; making your sad; awful sandwich about $5. My buddy ordered the double burger with provolone; lettuce; tomato; pickles; and hot peppers. He said the hot peppers were good but not very hot. The rest of the fixings were \  meh.\   As for the quality of the burger; it was a tad bit better than In-N-Out. But you pay at least 2-3 dollars for that \  tad bit.\    Speaking of paying more; watch out for those add-ons. Your reasonably priced burger can become outrageous for the quality with add-ons.  The fries were devoured; but there are very few fries I do not like.  Overall; I won't be back. This place isn't for me.   ",1.0,1.0
0," I have to say that I really don't understand the hype around this place. Maybe we went there on an off day. Maybe it's because I was born in raised in Chicago and am picky when eating at a place that says they are \chicago style\  .  I ordered an italian beef sweet. My friend ordered a chicago dog and we got a cheese fry. The beef itself was great but there were barely any peppers on the thing. Normally I like my italian beef soaking but this one tasted funny. I couldn't eat it. I just ate the meat inside. The chicago dog was cooked with way too much grease and the bun was soggy. At least they have all of the ingredients which are hard to come by. The cheese fries were decent.   It also took them a lot of time to make a relatively small order.   I have to say that for Tempe; the place is ok. I don't think it's anything special though. I'll have to try it again and see if maybe the service and the food is better in the afternoon instead of at night. I really wanted this experience to be great but alas it was not.   ",0.0,0.0

0,MEH....I wanted to love this place. Seriously. Especially with the awesome foursquare and yelp check in they offer.  Just so you aren't as surprised as I was when I got to the register with the check in : You must buy a sandwich and a drink and you will get a hot dog; Italian beef sandwich; or burger for free along with another drink.  Now i am not positive of what was reduced in price but i got a chili cheese burger; Italian beef sandwich and an order of crinkle cut fries with the two drinks for a total of 13ish dollars.       I began eating my OK french fries on the way home...Yes i said it they were Okay. If they were all crispier it might have had my attention.  (This could totally just be the weird time of the month where nothing ever really fills my cravings or taste buds aren't exactly satisfied in the slightest) So here I am a couple minutes from home anxiously waiting to see how this Burger and Italian beef shall taste!         For the big moment of truth.....The chili is wiped off the sides with my crinkle cut fries( not bad not great) I have been spoiled with PITTSBURGH WILLY'S NO BEAN CHILI(SO MUCH BETTER!!)  The chili from lobby's i can tell you right now i do not believe I will crave in the future like I do with PW's.  So after doing this til there are no french fries left; I go in for the big bite....And well...It was A-OK. Probably would have enjoyed it a little more without the chili and the nacho cheese type melted cheese melted on top of this poor poor burger.(I HATE NASTY CHEESE THAT REMINDS ME OF VELVEETA) *shivers*  The Italian beef sandwich is extremely extremely greasy to where my phone accidentally below my bag of food on the way home was almost drenched.  :[ Flavor...ehhh...pass. So i saved it for my boyfriend for when he comes home from a night out. He should love it. :]  My hopes and dreams of finding a place better than five guys was somewhat found especially for the price. Only reason I do not really care for five guys is because of the size of the burger for the price. As for this place their prices are on point. Too bad they don't have cajun spiced crinkle fries. Ohhhh that would be heaven!    Until then i might have to wait another week or two to go back again and try more on the menu or a regular burger.,0.0,0.0

I also ordered the Cheese Fries which was a pretty large portion with melted cheese wiz type cheese on it and very enjoyable.  The rest of the food also looked amazing and i was wishing i ordered the Italian beef after seeing another table with it; so next time i am getting that.  Also being close to ASU was nice since there were a few hot chick working behind the counter.,0.0,0.0
0,I initially was torn with this place. However; after trying other places in the Phoenix area for Italian beef; I can say that this place is simply ok. The prices are a bit high for what you get and the service has never been that friendly. The Italian beef is a bit dry and is not sliced thin enough. Additionally; I was not impressed with the Chicago dog. If I pay 3.50 for a hot dog; I would expect it to be fairly large. This was not the case at all. I have gotten bigger hot dogs at costco for 1.50 with a soda included. Anyways; been here twice now and I don't think I would return. I would rather drive the extra 10 miles to Taylor Street. Once you have eaten there; you will know what good Italian Beef should be like and its alot more reasonable price wise.,0.0,1.0
0,I'd heard a lot of good things about this place; and so I drove out there yesterday to see what 'it's all about'. Pulling up to the place encouraged me. Holes in the wall are often great finds; and believe me I was in the mood for a hot dog.   The people who were there were awesome. They had great personalities and one of them offered me a chili sample when I was going between two things to order. It was great--not the best; but great.  I ordered the chili dog and I asked for no cheese--they only carry processed cheese and I hate that stuff.  It was on my hotdog anyway when I got it (and keep in mind I was the only person in there and I thought I had been pretty clear about what I didn't want). I took a bite and I couldn't eat anymore. The cheese was all over and disgusting. The meager hot dog bun disintegrated under the weight of the chili and the whole thing doped out of my hands in a soggy mess.  Very disappointing.  So while the service was good (except the mistake) the food left me hungry. I immediately left and went to dinner at Sweet Tomatoes--so I could get the cheese taste out of my mouth.,1.0,1.0

0,Tried this while in town for for business based off of Yelp reviews. Had it delivered via the delivery service advertised on the business owners website huge mistake. I had a double burger which was decent the meat was really good but my friends had chili cheese dogs which for $5 I'm sorry should have been a lot bigger and a bowl of chili which seemed more like a side instead of a meal. the total for the three of us for dinner was a little more than 50 including delivery fees and it simply wasn't worth it. I think if we had actually gone into the restaurant we would have been happier it would have been cheaper and we would have had a better idea of what we were getting. That aside the chili was really good the beef was really good I truly believe it was just the delivery service that made it a bad experience if I ever try them again I will definitely go to the restaurant.,0.0,0.0
0,Good burgers and I'm told the Italian beef is good too but the service is not so good; it's a big high school hangout during the weekday afternoons and they don't cater to customers that come in after 9:30 pm.

I was really lazy because after reading that I went ahead and placed my order anyway. The sloth in me won that day. My food arrived 45 minutes later still warm. The burger was prepared to my liking. The mystery sauce was actually pretty spicy in a good way. The fries were Ore Ida crinkle cut which I liked. It reminded me of being a kid. The ice tea though is not sweetened and as a  Southern lady I spat that right back out.  Definitely will be going to the location to try again.,0.0,0.0

0,Are all burgers created equal? NO! Lobbys does it simple; and right. There isn't anything fancy about this burger and dog joint; it's in a old strip mall in tempe where they don't get too much foot traffic; but don't let that fool you. Their menu isn't too big; but they do have choices for pretty much everyone; including a veggie sandwich. I get the burger when I go and it is thick; juicy; and cooked to perfection.  My only gripe is they don't have a kid's menu so I have to order a $5 hotdog for my kid and he only eats 1/2 of it.,0.0,1.0
0,I just went for the first time last night.  I normally eat real healthy but I felt like having a cheat day and like a man I was craving meat.  The question was posed by my girlfriend; was this worth the cheat?  The answer is sort of.  We split a double burger and an order of fries.  We still couldn't finish the fries because the order was huge.  The burger was nicely cooked and the fries were perfectly crispy on the outside.  I did enjoy their house sauce as well.  However; this was a great big grease ball.  Yes I was in a burger shop but I wasn't expecting that much.  Lastly; the service was speedy and the food came out nice and hot.

I had no clue where to start my search as there have been a few \Chicago style\   places that have popped up around AZ and faded away... but after having a taste of Lobby's I hope they're around for a while.  The service was friendly and they cooked my food fresh. The wait was minimal and I was really pleased. I was craving Portillo's and this came kinda close... well; close for AZ lol.  I ordered the Chicago style hot dog; cheeseburger; fries and a drink. Everything tasted really good and just like back home.

The burger was cooked and in my hands within 10 minutes of ordering it.The difference in the burger between any other place and this place is that Burger N Fries makes theirs from all natural grass fed beef. In case your wondering; you can taste a difference. Instead of having no taste and being overcooked; the burgers served here are full of juice and are perfectly cooked.   The custard ice cream was quite the shake!   I was happy to see that the restaurant including the bathrooms were VERY clean. This is something this restaurant does extremely well.   The service was pretty good. I think they could improve a little on more interactions with the customers. For example; it would be good to greet the customer when he/she enters the restaurant and leaves. The water cups were pretty small. I would like to see them make the change to a larger cup so that the customer doesn't have to get up and refill their drink after every 3-4 sips.   Other than that; they have made some improvements since the last time I visited. Keep up the hard work.   ",1.0,1.0

The drive was long but definitely worth it.

As we were getting our drinks at the awesome soda machine with a variety of different  flavors; our sushi was already finished being made! I already knew the sushi was pretty good but my friend was blown away by how delicious he thought they were. Within a couple minutes our chicken lettuce wraps were brought to our table. The lettuce was fresh; the chicken was flavorful and tasty. The chicken lettuce wraps is one of my favorite dishes on the menu. After munching on our appetizers for a few minutes; the waitress brought our two entrees to our table. The Pei Wei chicken is my favorite entree on the menu; it has a unique flavor and they made it exactly how I wanted it. No carrots or snap peas but add tons of broccoli. Plus extra sauce on the side because I just enjoy the flavor of the Pei Wei Spicy. The fried rice was quite mouth-watering and I enjoyed it as well. We couldn't even finish half of our small portions of entrees so it was great to box up to-go and save for the next day to eat!   All in all; the staff were quite friendly; the entire restaurant was cleaned/organized and the food was great and has big portions for a low fair price.

We usually come here when the husband has a hankering for \Chinese food\   but doesn't want \  authentic\   Chinese food.  I can deal.  The parking kind of sucks here though so try to avoid coming during peak hours.  I've had pretty consistent decent service though whether it be dine in or take out.   ",1.0,1.0
0,The staff was awful and you could tell none of them wanted to be there. They also managed to screw up 3 of the 4 things we ordered and made the 4th so bad; we had to send it back. The food was fresh but couldn't wait to leave and never come back. The Pad Thai was awful; mushy and greasy with no flavor. The spicy tuna roll was actually a regular tuna roll with a blob of disgusting spicy mayo next to it on the plate.,0.0,0.0

0,This Particular In-N-Out is very friendly; even for In-N-Out standards.  The help are all diligent and quick; and also caring about their customer service.  If you are not familiar with In-N-Out they appear to have a simple menu of burgers; fries; drinks; and shakes.  They do have a secret menu (http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp) which you should check out.  I get animal style on my burger AND my fries.  Delicious.  Also; make sure you pick up a shirt while you're there; at $9.50 it's almost a steal!!,1.0,1.0

0,Sonic in general serves up a pretty tasty diet cherry limeade and some indulgent milkshakes that allow you to mix several flavors in; such as strawberry chocolate or banana pineapple.  They have happy hour from 2-4 P.M. each day on their drinks (such as limeades) and slushes.  They have gotten rid of a lot of their chicken options though; which saddened me as I was a fan of their chicken club toaster.  This Sonic location might have some problems with their microphone at the drive through; because our orders seem to get confused more often than at other fast food places.,0.0,1.0
0,Me and my wife came when there was almost no one at this location. We ordered tots and medium hot fudge shakes. They brought us hot fudge sundaes. Then after we got our food they came back out and asked us to re-park our car in the empty parking lot because we pulled in backwards. We will not be returning to this poorly managed Sonic.,0.0,0.0
0,Volunteered for a local non-profit in this area years ago; and frequently stopped here on my way in . . . For drinks; that is!  When it comes to refreshing summer concoctions on the cheap; Sonic is hard to beat.   I love the Diet Cherry Limeades and the Lemon Berry Slush!   Not a fan of Sonic's grub; the mystery meat burgers are pretty sketch. But the Mozzarella Sticks aren't bad!    Everyone here was very friendly. Great service too.,1.0,1.0
0," Wow.... where do I start?  Well about a week ago I ordered a burger and a side; I received the wrong burger and the wrong side; but I had already rode my bike home. So I called the manager on duty; lets call him \T\  . He was SUPER kind and wrote me down for a comp the next time I came in which was tonight.  I came all the way from phoenix but wanted to claim my free meal on the way home so I stopped in. It took them 15 MIN to bring out my comp order; but it was wrong again because they didn't read the order back to me to verify (and they never have). So I told the carhop and it took another ten minutes to get the correct burger out to me. By this time; my side item was cold. I had every intention of tipping the carhop even though I was claiming a free order. But she was so distant and lacked people skills and didn't remember the things I requested and didn't look me in the eyes; plus my order was wrong a third time. By the time I rode home; my food was cold (I even had it in a warm environment for the whole journey) and there was little to no condiments on my burger! Who wants a dry burger? Not this guy. All I can say; is the night manager on duty every time I go there looks like a punk (hood always covering his face; and I sound old for saying that; but I'm a 25 year old punk rocker myself; haha) and the kitchen seems to be stoned because I witnessed 3 inaccurate orders while I was trying to claim mine.  My main complaint is that I worked at Sonic for over 2 years; and this kind of behavior at my locations would've gotten me fired. I've returned to the restaurant business since then and my philosophy is STILL to treat the customer how you would like to be treated. What's so hard about that?! Yeah; it's fast food. Yeah; they get paid minimum wage. But if you cant even follow your recipes; common sense; and core values; you don't deserve to have the job. There's many people out of work who would kill to have a job; even at Sonic. It's sad because this location is RIGHT by my house and it's good for a quick; cheap meal; but I will not be returning. This is absolutely the WORST Sonic experience I've ever had and it's the worst Sonic I've been to. What a shame; too; because it's in such a nice area. Maybe it's just the night crew since that's the time I usually visit; but all I know is this location needs a revamping of values and employees.   ",0.0,0.0
0,My fiance and I arrived roughly around 1020 and ended up leaving at 1105 without our order. No one bothered to check up on us and I was too pissed off after waiting more than 40 minutes to even dare ask. The car that arrived at 1055 got their order within 10 minutes and that's what pissed us off the most.  I have a feeling the kid never registered our order to begin with as it doesn't take 40 minutes to at least make a shake.,0.0,1.0
0,I still haven't fully decided where my heart lies with Chipotle.   Half of the time when I come here; I get great food! The other half of the time; it sucks. I usually get weird pieces of chicken in my salads; or burritos (depending on my order). Once it almost even made me consider reinstating my vegetarianism.  Honestly; though; the last few times I have been here they have done an exceptional job. I will have to update later.,0.0,0.0
0," I love Chipotle and have been coming to this location since it opened.  But from here on out; I think I'll pass.    The two times that I have ordered online (only 2 weeks apart); I am left waiting because the employees forget to check the online orders.  That is; I show up at the time that I am told the food will be ready; only to find that they haven't even looked at my order.  To make matters worse; both times they failed to push my order to the front of the line; so I've been left waiting a while... Neither times have I been offered anything other than a \we're sorry\  ; talk is cheap.  The other night that this happened to me; they actually had a guy in line who had an order for 2; but his card kept declining (and he apparently had no other cards).  So the manager tells him; that the meal is on the house... now admittedly that is a very nice gesture... but they probably should have offered me something to make up for their screw up (twice)... nope.  I won't be back.   ",0.0,0.0
0," I hesitated to write this. I mean; everyone has a bad day; but in the end; my disgust and frustration won out. On 3/2 my son and I dined at this location. The young man at the counter - Alex - was super nice and friendly. Unfortunately; the rest of our visit was less than stellar. About half way through our meal; three kids (around age 11 or so) came in a got water cups from someone behind the counter. These kids spend over 10 minutes at the soda machine tasting every possible concoction of soft drink; rinsing their cups under the fountain; then wiping them out with napkins they left on the counter. I finally got up to say something to \Tom\   the manager when one of the boy started washing under the water dispenser. Despite the boys being there over 10 minutes at this point; he claim he hadn't seen anything. His response to my complaint and concern - 1) \  No kids come behind the counter so it's ok.\   2) \  I'm not their parents. We'll clean it up later.\     To Tom (and Popeye's) I say this - No; you are not therr parents. What you are is a manager our a facility that serves food to the public. You have a duty with that job to make sure the place is kept as clean as possible which includes asking people to leave if needed.  Our bill was just over $20. These 3 kids spend $0. Hope they come back with their parents to eat; because you won't be getting our business again.

0," Whoever likes subway may not like this place. Jersey mike's cut; cooks; & prepare to order; no chilled meat bins here. The sandwiches has the right amount of everything. No one condiment or topping will over power you sandwich of choice. I always recommend getting the sandwiches done \Mike's way\  . It's tomatoes; lettuce; red wine vinegar; olive oil; herbs and salt&pepper. You don't really need more than that.   ",0.0,0.0
0," I've been to this location a few times as this is my \go-to-spot\   while waiting to meet people from Craigslist to buy or sell something from people around Tempe.    I love the way they slice all the ingredients; the meats and the cheese right on the spot according to the sandwich you order.    They also hot sandwiches here and they don't nuke them in microwaves like they do at subway.  They have a grill!  Jersey Mike's is no-brainer over Subway any day!   ",0.0,0.0
0,Just like the rating says on here; they are A-OK. After my second visit here; I am confident enough to say that they are quite simply a traditional sub shop; like subway used to be before Jared waded over and lost all the weight. Lets discuss the pros and cons of Jersey Mikes - Tempe.  ~Fud/Drink~ Jersey Mikes; first off; has solid; traditional; sub options. If you want a simple Italian sub with extra olive oil; and tasty Italian meats; come here and munch down. If you want a foofie Hawaiian pineapple open faced mozzarella sub (just made that up; it sounds good) then go elsewhere. Their food options are pretty simple; but the meats help make each sub. Overall; they offer just a a couple of add-in options to your sub and they aren't high quality; especially the lettuce and tomatoes.  The tomatoes are pretty slimy; not super-fresh and the lettuce seems to be of the bagged variety. The bread is average as well; nothing amazing to write home about. The onions actually looked nice; they were presented in their dish all pre-strung; rather than chopped up. They were also white onions; not the traditional red; which I actually enjoyed better on the sub. But once again; the meats...they are great. Overall; its a shame they don't put more stock in everything besides the meat; because they did a good job there. They have no beers by the way; a soda fountain with regular options will do just fine. If you need a beer; Wingstop next store has a number of beers on stock.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The service here is near-perfect. They are fast; friendly and intelligently listen to your order. The sub came down the assembly line and was in the hands of the toppings-adder (what is the title of this person anyway?) quickly. I did take issue with the fact that the pieces of cheese they added on the sub were about as thin as I get at the deli at a supermarket; super-thin; that is. Normally you expect a couple semi-thick slices of cheese; but the provolone slivers they gave me were so small I could barely taste that flavor. After accepting my request for extra lettuce and tomatoes I went and asked for some sides in cups which he dished for me in fast order as well. There is no true ambiance to the place; they have a simple set up with chairs and tables; music isn't a priority. Its a sub-shop guys.  ~Extras/Rating!~ They taste MUCH better than the generic Subway. Please just discard Subway and eat at a real sub shop like this one. You get so much more when you eat a spot like this. I do hope JM's takes a look into better quality minus the meat.  They do a real good job at customer service and the management knows how to train their employees well. The subs hold up well against other competitors. However I feel as though I am paying more than necessary for a sandwich that is pretty average besides the items I already laid out for you.  I wish they would let us do take home service of their meats; that would be great. This place is deserving of better than 3 stars; maybe 3 1/2...But we don't have that option; do we ;-) ? Would I come back? YES! I have tried two completely different items; and it seems Italian is the best route. I am not an Italian sub guy per-say; but this is a tasty treat if I am in that mood. Try your best to make your first sub an Italian one; and ENJOY!,1.0,1.0
0,I will agree with the overpriced issue with Jersey Mike's.  Besides that...this is the best damn Philly Cheese Steak I have had in Arizona.  (I am not from Philly; so I admit I am not a pro at the Cheese Steak cuisine)  Everything there is fresh; from the bread to the veggies to the meat.  My sandwich is never a mess..which is amazing in itself. Service is great; even for ASU students working there.  Great location....Really can't say anything bad about the place...it just sucks when there is construction on Scottsdale road and it makes it almost impossible to get there.  (One day it was so bad; I had to settle for Rubios....not a good settle when all you want is a cheese steak.),0.0,1.0
0,Jersey Mikes has GREAT subs but still isn't a replacement for Subway.   While I love their turkey sub; they don't have a very wide variety of sandwich toppings and I don't like their tuna. (I need black olives and spinach! Maybe I'm just spoiled.)  I'll come here for a turkey sub but if I feel like tuna I'll stick to subway.  When I came with my cousin she ordered a sub with nothing but mayo and lettuce on it and after some laughter the guy behind the counter refused to let her pay for such a measly sandwich. When she ordered the same thing at Subway they charged her for a veggie anyways. It was pretty cool of him.,0.0,0.0
0,How can you go wrong with Chipotle?! I've always enjoyed this place and their fast; quick service. I use the Chipotle app during lunch hour to avoid the lines. Order on your app; choose to pay at the store and go straight to the register. However; sometimes I do visit this location spur of the moment. Not only is their staff fast and friendly but the food has always been excellent. I prefer the burrito bowls and tacos. I would consider Chipotle inexpensive but some may argue with me on that. However; I think you get what you pay for and at Chipotle they definitely serve some goodness! I always recommend Chipotle especially this location's service. Order all four salsas to give your burrito that extra kick!,1.0,1.0

0,Had the patty melt and a concrete here. The patty melt had a tiny amount of onions on it; with melted cheese on rye bread. I liked that the ground meat is cooked fresh as soon as you order it; but it wasn't as juicy as other burgers I've had at other places. The burger itself really needed the special sauce from the counter to give it more flavor.  The fries were thin cut; and just a tad over-salted.  The concrete was good; filled with thick frozen custard; with a lot of nuts; pineapple; and strawberry. It's no Ted Drewes frozen custard; but it'll do for Arizona!  Service was fast and friendly.,1.0,1.0
0,This place was so bad. Service was slow. We got the single burger; fries & chocolate shakes. The burger was paper thin. No really no exaggeration.

0,YES!  I loved this place.  Had a double cheeseburger plain (bread; meat; cheese) and the flavor; texture; size was just perfect.  The peanut butter cup and banana concrete was super good.

We had no fries; no drinks.,0.0,0.0
0,I've come to this location a couple times and arrived back at home with the order wrong.   They're quite pricey too; so when you drive off with your order you expect them to get it right. The burgers are okay; the fries are good; the frozen custard is pretty good too. Most recent order was a frozen custard with brownie pieces.  My cup came out with the brownie pieces in the bottom of the container and the custard was simply filled on top of the brownie.  I thought the additions were mixed in. I know you're not supposed to make assumptions.,0.0,0.0
0,Freddy's at Elliott and McClintock has only been open a few days and is looking to be a worthy addition to the neighborhood.  The burger was large and thin (having obviously been smashed on the grill); edges were a little crispy and taste was generally quite good. Cheese was melted between the burgers and added some moisture and what my eldest daughter likes to call cheesy goodness.  Fries were  a little disappointing.  While the meat seemed to be of good quality for a fast food place; the fries weren't thin enough to be crispy or thick enough to be tasty.  I don't put catsup on my fries; but these needed it.  They were dry and lacking in taste.  So four stars for the burger; one star for the fries; five stars for pleasant smiling service in a drive thru.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.  Since it's new and I'm the first reviewer and I'm delighted to have a new dining option near my home; I'm rounding up to 5 stars.,1.0,0.0
0," The burgers are tasty; with fresh ingredients. The shakes here are decent; and a good deal for the price. The atmosphere though... well... that's another story. I've been to several Steak 'n Shakes in the Midwest; and this one is more like a \Steak 'n Shake Express.\   I guess that's what makes this \  Steak 'n Shake Signature\   restaurant different; but in ways that make me miss the original versions of the chain. This isn't a diner- it's more like eating at an In N Out or a Fatburger. There's just a small seating area; you order and pick up at the counter; and it is not open 24/7. The menu is very limited as well; with less to offer than the diner versions.  The general feel of the place is more modern; and more hip. Top 40 music plays on the speakers; the interior and even the font signage out front has a contemporary feel. They even have one of the new Coke soda fountains that allow you to pick various flavor combinations. Back when I used to live in the Midwest; I had many memories of having late night eats at various Steak 'n Shakes with friends; indulging in greasy burgers and fries on white plates; and lusciously thick shakes in glass milkshake cups. Eating at this Steak 'n Shake makes me long for the actual diner; although the food itself still tastes the same. For me; some of that magic is lost for this particular restaurant when I am eating in a small area with a large crowd of people; getting my order at the counter; and eating my burger; fries; and shake in a fast-food type manner.  We went here on a Sunday around noon. We got in before the big rush; since a few minutes after we ordered; there was a line out the door; winding around the block! Our order took maybe 10-15 minutes to be made; and seating was limited.   I ordered the Royale; partially because it conjured images of Samuel L. Jackson talking about a Royale with Cheese in Pulp Fiction; and partially because the addition of bacon and egg to a burger sounded delicious. The order came with fries; and I also had some of a banana milkshake. The Royale was indeed delicious; with juicy; flavorful ground beef; fresh tomato; crisp lettuce (Green leaf; not the cheapo iceberg lettuce!); melted cheese; a smoky salty flavor from the bacon; and a nice rich; creamy texture and taste from the fried egg. The bun was soft and held up well with the other ingredients. The shake was OK. It tasted more like imitation banana flavored syrup rather than fresh banana mixed in with ice cream; but at $3; hey what do I expect?  The fries were thin; and slightly crispy. They were decent; but the real star of the meal was the burger.   I will be waiting the day that perhaps a full service Steak 'n Shake can open in the Phoenix area. Until then; this express version will have to do!   ",0.0,0.0

0,For anyone that is actually from Illinois to defend this place is ridiculous.  The parking is horrendous; beer and wine?  Organic burgers?  HOT DOGS?  Really?  When I saw S & S I wanted a S & S and oh what''s up with the menu being overhead?  Got a headache just from looking up to read it.  Walked out without ordering a thing.  No thanks.  I will just depend on Walmart for the cans of REAL chili and make my own chili mac.   I grew up with three of these places in my hometown and even worked at one when I was a teen.  This is a total disappointment.   I'll wait til the new and real franchises come to town.  I don't care how much the investor put into this place either.  If he wanted to do a half as*ed job then that's exactly what he did too.  The location of this place makes it very clear that all they wanted to cater to is the college kids.

0," OK folks I'm seriously getting irritated with the one and 2 stars because this location doesn't have the full menu.   All of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250;000 to open the new \Signature\   location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future. They are getting their feet wet in the AZ market.   I'm from Illinois where Steak and Shake originated; and yes I am highly disappointed that I cannot get a Chili Mac or a Chili 5 way or my beloved Hot fudge milkshake here.   However I am delighted that I can at least still get a stellar Original Double Steakburger; Fries and a Chocolate shake. THANK YOU TO THE OWNERS FOR BRINGING THOSE! I APPRECIATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For those of you who are saying the burger is not the same; you are wrong!   You have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.  Order the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar.   Also Steak and Shake isn't like Freddy's Frozen custard; Freddy's Frozen custard is a knock off of Steak and Shake! Steak and Shake was founded in 1934; Freddy's 2002! NUFF SAID!  I've taken 3 or 4 people here and they loved it!   ",0.0,0.0
0," Well; being from the MidWest; I was super excited; on our cross-country road trip (two summers ago) to introduce my own family to SnS.  It did not disappoint and we had SnS atleast 4 times during the 3 week outing.  The following year (last year) when we repeated that trip; we were sure to stop by SnS (kids were practically begging).  On that trip; we even asked them when they might bring one our way.  Little did I know that they had already planned it.  When I told my kids that Steak 'n Shake would; indeed; open a restaurant in the valley; they couldn't wait.  Well; after discovering that it was already opened; my wife and I ventured out to the SnS Signature restaurant to enjoy some great fast food.  I read the reviews on Yelp (prior to heading out) and prepared her for the reality that the experience would not be like we were used to.  Having said that; we pleased with the food we received.  I ordered the Original and my wife had the Western BBQ & Bacon.  The food was received promptly; and was delicious.  My only comment (as it relates to the food) would be a lack of consistency in the fries.  Because they are cut so thin (shoestring) they varied from very crispy (almost burnt) to something more palatable.  The service was great (on par with what you might expect to find in other \counter-service\   restaurants.  It definitely was not the Steak 'n Shake experience that we were used to; but given the choice between not having a local SnS and having to drive several hours to get the full SnS menu / experience; I think SnS Signature is an acceptable alternative (for now).  I do; however; echo the sentiments of others requesting that SnS bring the full diner experience to AZ.   ",1.0,1.0
0," I woke up yesterday morning with three words on my mind: \STEAK AND SHAKE.\    Working across the street from this location; I was getting a little worried (okay; a lot worried) as the morning dragged on and my inbox became flooded with the e-mails of equally concerned co-workers panicking about the long line that was building up ahead of the grand opening. I work with quite a few people from the east coast; who had been telling me nothing but good things about the Steak 'n Shake chain ever since we found out one was opening on Mill. Luckily; once doors opened at 11 the line moved through quite quickly and me and my equally hungry coworkers had a window to grab our long-awaited fast food before the next wave started around noon.  I ordered the Original (it being opening day and my first time at a Steak 'n Shake; I had to go with the signature) with fries and a Cookies and Cream milkshake (trust me; you'll want to order the milkshake). Within ten minutes; my burgers and fries were gone and I was onto the milkshake. Hey; I'd pretty much been hungry all morning and the panic about the line didn't hurt.  I'd say this is comparable to an In 'N Out; but with a slightly pricier menu and more selection. I'm sure opening day won't be anywhere close to the last time I order from here.   ",0.0,0.0
0,I really really wanna like this place but there is just something that is off. The skinny Back story Before I decided to purchase vehicle I used to ride the light rail home mon-fri I would travel east on university exit mill ave and walk to light rail station. I one day saw the sign for a steak and shake I def got excited as I have heard of this chain from family and friends in Illinois and as a lover of shakes. They had a great prices a good size burger and fries for 4$ the burger is def a greasy bastard but what do u expect from a burger. Taste wise was ok no real distinct seasoning on it pretty bland but it was ok. The fries are great the first time they were pretty salty but they have since gotten better the only problem is they have a lot of crumbs and fries edges. The milkshake tastes like leaving ice cream with out a lid in freezer and it getting that freezer burn taste; everytime I go back I just skip the shake but I may give it another shot soon. Service is great and fast parking can and usually is a nightmare.  This place deserves more of a 2 1/2 stars instead of 3 but they are def not a 2 I have had worse burgers and for the price I'm not complaining I have gone back a few times pretty much cause they gave me and my girl a free burger on our birthday which she gave to me :-) score!! I will still go back cause I do love the cheese fries just hook up more fries please.,1.0,0.0
0,It was my first time coming to this place today. Came during my lunch hour; I was surprised it wasnt full of people! Service was good; very nice cashier upfront (I believe her name was Jamie). I ordered the original double cheese n fries. Omgggg! It was delicious! I saw the burger and thought I wouldnt get full lol but its actually the perfect size. I wasnt over stuffed when done and was very satisfying. The burger was a little greasy but sooooooo delicious! The fries... I wasnt a big fan; dont get me wrong; they are good but they are really thin so they are a little on the crispier side. Im not a fan of crispy foods. I would highly recommend this place!,1.0,1.0
0,Parking is a royal pain in the butt since it is Mill Ave and you either have to find and pay for street parking or park in the lot and walk quite a bit.  The service wasn't great.  Not overly helpful or attentive.  Was unable to add seasoned fries onto my child's kids meal so she didn't get what she wanted.  I tried the Original Double.  I really didn't care for the meat; bread or toppings.  I didn't get what I ordered either... Bun; meat; cheese and ketchup.  There was a huge chunk of tomato on the bottom.  The fries were pretty good - super skinny.  The best part and the only thing I would come back for is the Salted Caramel Pretzel Milkshake.  Seriously yum!  My girls each had the grilled cheese kids meal.  They told me the grilled cheese tasted funny.  I wasn't interested in trying it to see why.

0,This place is GREAT! My boss took us here for lunch the second day they were open because it is his fave burger joint and since he moved from the Midwest; he hasn't been able to find one down here. I moved from MI so I can relate. Even though we went on the second day they were open and the place was a little packed; the service was fast AND friendly. I got the regular cheese burger and fries meal for $3.99 with a Mint Choco Chip shake that was to DIE for. There is nothing to say about the food other than you can't beat it. Burger Who? and forget McDonald's--I'll never ever eat there again! I have to be honest; I can't wait to go back.  We ordered four meals and two shakes all for under $30! You CAN'T BEAT THAT!  Great experience; great environment; great location (although parking leaves a little to be desired); and AMAZING FOOD! Go here. Order anything. You'll be happy!,1.0,1.0
0,When I think of Steak 'n Shake I think of what should be a pleasant experience.   For starters the person that took the order was not very friendly. She seemed more preoccupied with texting on her cell phone than serving customers. I ordered a burger combo.   The burger had good flavor and was loaded. However the fries were very cold and skimpy. The drink machine was not working properly because the choices were either out or not serviceable. Overall the place could have been a bit more clean. The tables were dirty and not wiped down in some time.   Other customers next to us expressed they were not happy with the quality of food received. It seemed to set the tone overall of this particular place.   The prices seem reasonable but should be reflective of the product. On this occasion it was not. This is not what I would expect from Steak 'n Shake. Perhaps another location may be suggested.,0.0,0.0
0,My order is always wrong. There hasn't been a single time I've been in here that my order has been right.   The place looks and feels like the person who put it together had NEVER been in the restaurant business before. I mean honestly; have you used their trash cans? How about having a buzzer system that makes you get up for your food twice every time? Once for your shake and once for your food.   Honestly; the food is GREAT when it is correct; which means NO mayo or NO tomato.   The robot employees could have a little more character as well.,0.0,0.0
0,So for all the years I had to hear how great this place is from family and business friends I finally went down to check it out.  Go for the shakes; don't go for anything else.  I know this is nothing like the ones east of Arizona but they really need to tell people that the amazing menu online is nothing like what you see when you come to this Mill Ave location. This limited menu is a dissappointment compared to the real Steal N Shakes.  As for the service ALOT of bad things going on down there as other reviews have stated. The trash cans are just plain stupid. The fact that the employees don't care about their jobs show and the amazingly stupid 2 buzzer system means this place will close in time. I watched everyone get their drinks in 5-10 minutes then wait 10-20 minutes to get their food.   The shakes are great. The one thing they got right. The burgers and fries ? Um why ? The fries are greasy the burgers are tasteless.  Overall  would only go back for the shakes and then would walk down to Jack in the Box for burgers that are better.  They need to re-think this location and would be better off opening a full steak n shake with a driv-thru and full menu plus get a staff that cares about their jobs.,0.0,0.0
0,STK 2013  Ninja stomach silent but hungry.  Order: Soba Noodles; Side Curry; Small Salad; Side Vegetables  Entree: Soba  Culinary Thought: I enjoyed this; all while applying a not-so known noisy ninja noodle-noshing technique .  Whilst consuming noodles; it is the only time for ninja to make sounds!  Also; it allows one to truly experience the essence of  soba.  Come with me sometime for a demonstration.    Ninja Eating Plan: The season of winter was heavily upon the area at the time so it was appropriate.  I did negate the chicken provided; for this ninja is a vegetarian seeking the ultimate enlightenment. The gentle mix of gomashio (Japanese black and white salt granules) and shichimi (Japanese 7 spice pepper) nicely accompanied the broth but I do wish it was hotter due to my extensive ninja warrior training in the cold.  The noodles were the star of the dish; with the spinach playing a strong second shamisen.  Dessert: Chocolate Cake  Culinary Thought:  Normally ninja pass on dessert.  Tokyo Express is an exception to that ninja rule.  They KNOW dessert.   Gotten better since last time but I am eager to discover if it is even better now in 2013!  Happy New Year Tokyo Express!  P.S. I will return before the first blossoms of Spring after extensive ninja mountain training.  Itadakimasu!!!!!!!,0.0,0.0
0,For the money.....great job! I don't know what I like more; the option to sub white rice with brown or the spa-like music playing at just the right level. The bamboo shades & slatted seats (however counter-service the place is otherwise) really made this eatery feel relaxing and soft and COOL on a warm day :) I wasn't sure what my taste buds really wanted that day. I played it safe and ordered something I could compare easily to other restaurants: Teriyaki chicken bowl was tasty & lite. I would have used a bit more sauce; but i tend to do that anyway; so maybe it was par for a good bowl presentation. They offer Bento box; some sushi; lots of veggie and fish options; and a kind approach to service with authentic smiles :) **Visit was 7/20/12,1.0,1.0
0,It hurts my heart to give any Chipotle a one star.  Their chicken fajita burritos with pico and extra corn is to die for.   However; on one particular morning; this Chipotle really failed to deliver.  I was hung over and on my way to work and Chipotle got in my head... and once it gets in there; nothing else can deliver.  I ordered my delicious usual; but unfortunately the person creating my burrito didn't spread out any of the ingredients.  While eating I had 6 mouthfuls of just chicken and tortilla; then I had clumps of cold cheese and then an endless amount of veggies with no chicken or cheese in sight... disgusting.  It literally ruined my day.  Instead of getting an instant cure to my hangover; it took it to another level because I was overly annoyed and just unsatisfied.    I will return to my beloved Chipotle; but I'll be sure to keep a close eye on the creator.,0.0,0.0
0," They were not paying attention when I was ordering; maybe the heat was getting to them? I kept repeating myself and they still ended up not charging me for my drink and were baffled when I asked for my cup. It was good; but as a native Californian I was a little alarmed when I saw the 
o firearms allowed in the store\   sign outside after already sitting down. Really; Arizona? That's nothing on Chipotle; though. If anything; kudos to them for that. Four for the clean area; good quality and good air conditioning. Otherwise; those workers need coffee or something!   ",0.0,0.0
0,I'm generally a fan of Chipotle and recently having started HCG and eating clean; even more so. Just a quick tip - If anyone is looking for a decent place to eat out on HCG and not get off track; Chipotle is your answer!   During the very low calorie protocol even - you can order a side of chicken or steak and a side of pico.  It's typically only $3 too.   Yeah Chipotle!,0.0,0.0
0,I have been a long time fan of Chipotle and always have a great experience when I visit. Its a go to place when I'm watching carbs and when I'm not; I LOVE their chips! I could eat a whole bag by myself and that's probably what's caused me to diet in the first place :) You can lesson the calorie blow by ordering the kids sized bag of chips. It seems to come with 15-20 chips which is a more waistline friendly portion if you have to have them.   If you want something that satisfying and doesn't kill your diet; try a bowl with no rice or beans but get a scoop of chicken AND Steak. The extra meat really adds to the heartiness of the bowl and it feels like a treat. I also get mild salsa (pico); sour cream; cheese and the guacamole depending on how I'm feeling that day. If its a diet splurge day; I'm adding the sweet corn and tacking on a bag of chips!,0.0,0.0
0,Food is great and you can modify to fit most diets. HOWEVER; the MOD that was there today at lunch is worthless!  Chipotle; get rid of this waste of space and lower your prices on guacamole!    Probably won't visit this location again because of this parasite.   Oh and don't order online; ever; they mess up your order and it takes way longer then waiting in line.,0.0,1.0
0,Amazingly amazing inexpensive pizza. The crust is very thin and crispy which I love.  Came with my wife and since friends.  We all had custom pizzas which were cooked in about 5 minutes. Some of us had salad which was also custom and made to order. Everything was fantastic. Can't wait to come back. Oh and the Orchid is also amazing.  8 bucks max. Cheese pie I 6!,0.0,1.0
0,Love the idea of this place; fresh; fast; build-your-own pizza! They have a great variety and good options for different dietary needs.  I got a gluten-free crust with marinara sauce and nearly every vegetable offered..no cheese. It was very good; but I did feel a little sick after eating it; not sure why. I did really enjoy it though. My sister ordered a pookie and liked it as well. It was the perfect single serving haha.   This place is also very reasonably priced which is a big plus. You can get whatever you want and they do not really charge extra.   Will definitely be coming back :),0.0,0.0

0,No complaints. The service was perfect. Two college kids with great attitudes and friendly service. They walked us through how it worked and even cleaned off our area while we sat and talked.  The decor was modern and very hip. Not a huge fan of the graffiti but it gives it individual sense of style. The pizza place really stands out I comparison to any resteraunt I've been to due to it's system and decorum.  Lots of toppings and because they have such a hot fiery oven it can heat up numerous toppings .  Items looked fresh and up to code no wilted veggies and the spinach is put into olive oil?   Also had a steak and blue salad. Just right amount of balsamic and cheese. Great portions for 20 dollars I was so full and ready for a nap.   First place I've been to in Scottsdale that really impressed me.,1.0,1.0
0," If I were to write a movie about my experience at Fired Pie; it would be a complete comedy of errors titled \Is Anyone Here Listening To Me?\    Fired Pie has been on my radar since it's close to where I live and I could basically live off pizza if I had to (and even if I didn't have to). The glowing Yelp reviews helped make our choice to go in for an early dinner on Friday.  The experience of making your own pizza and choosing your own toppings is awesome...if the people behind the counter are actually listening to you. Here is; verbatim; how it went when it was my turn:  Guy: \  What can I get started for you?\   Me: \  I'll have the veggie pizza; but with pesto instead of red sauce\   Guy: \  Sure\   *immediately picks up red sauce and puts all over my pizza* Me: \  ...can I have some pesto on there too?\   Guy: \  Yeah. What kind of cheese?\   Me: \  ...um. Mozzerella.\   Guy: *Puts mozz on my pizza; slides it down to toppings area* Me: \  Can I please have some pesto on there too?\   Guy: \  Oh; sure\   *drizzles small spiral of pesto over cheese*  So. That's how that started.   The girl who handled my toppings seemed to have no idea what went on their menu-standard veggie. We both kept having to look back at the one menu on the side wall (they should definitely invest in an over-the-back-counter menu ala every other fast/casual food joint for ease) and check to make sure she got it correct. She wasn't sure what went on my boyfriend's pesto chicken pie either.   Speaking of boyfriend; he also handled to ordering for the field greens and roasted veggie salad we wanted. First guy lined up two salad bowls; so it looks like they split them there with no problem. Great! He also asked that they sub the balsamic out for italian dressing; which guy said would be no problem.  Once our pizzas rode the struggle bus out of the toppings area; we were asked for our names to write on the paper that our pizza slid onto in the oven; to keep everyone straight. We told them our order was for there; ordered drinks from the woman at the end of the line and sat down at a booth; after we picked up our own silverware and parm/red pepper shakers. Hopefully we could get over our ordering disaster and eat some delicious pizza!  I heard my name called and looked to the counter to see two pizza boxes and a boxed salad sitting on top (complete with a side of...you guessed it...balsamic dressing.) I couldn't do anything but laugh; it was the perfect ending to this nightmare of an order. First guy behind the counter had even taken out two bowls for our salad TO EAT THERE! Boyfriend was about to have a stress embolism so I scooped up our food and got the hell out of there. \  We would literally have to order the opposite of what we wanted for it to come out right the first time;\   he said in the car. Basically.  Why the second star? I have to be fair; the food was absolutely delicious. The pizza's crust was really on point and the salad was completely filled with roasted veggie toppings (and even better once I added my own dressing from our fridge.) But it was downright insulting to have NO ONE working there listening to us. I don't understand at all. Was it an off night? Was it an off team working? Did they hate us for some reason? I doubt I can convince the boyfriend to go back; so maybe I'll never know. Dang.   ",0.0,0.0
0,One of the owners of Fired Pie reached out to me after reading my initial review. He apologized for our bad experience; said it was not up to their standards and offered to send me a gift card to try them out again. I accepted; and was really happy to see someone higher up caring about customers.  We called in an order last night; exactly the same as before. One veggie pie with pesto instead of red sauce; one pesto chicken pie and a roasted veggie salad with Italian instead of balsamic. My boyfriend had the call on speaker and I heard the girl repeat our order back to him just as we wanted it. Great!  Apparently all did not go as smooth as it sounded when he went to go pick up our food. First; the girl at the register didn't know how to run the gift card. Then; when our order was 10 cents over the gift card's $25 amount; she gave my boyfriend back the wrong change. (He only had a $20 on him and she initially gave him back $19.10 instead of $19.90)   THEN we get home and all looks well...except my pie has red sauce on it. Fired Pie; do you have a personal vendetta against me eating pesto or what?! I started cracking up; and boyfriend vowed that he'll never go there again. It SUCKS; because the food is so great! We received the correct dressing this time for the salad; which was delish! It just goes to show how little service details can really make or break a place for us. Luckily for Fired Pie; it looks like basically everyone else going there has four or five star experiences...I guess we're just outta luck.,0.0,0.0

0," I was so excited to see a Culver's open up right by where I live. I haven't had it since I moved out here from the Midwest. Their chicken tenders are the best and I always get them. You really can't get them anywhere else. They're super juicy but crispy at the same time.   However; I'm going to be unbiased and write my review for this location only.  The food; as I mentioned before; was great and just like what I remembered. The service and atmosphere; that's another story. I understand that they just opened very recently so they probably still have some training/kinks to work on. I'll definitely be back and will update my rating if they deserve it.   Strike one; the first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench. It smelled like a mixture of rotten eggs and a gas station restroom. I noticed it was really bad where you order your food and wasn't so bad in the seating area. They really need to work on their ventilation or something. It's really hard to enjoy your food when you have to smell that.   Strike two; when I received my food; I noticed that I was given regular fries instead of sweet potato fries. I told the person who brought them to me that I had ordered the sweet potato fries. She walked off with my food and her attitude. She came back a little later and asked if I was sure if I ordered the sweet potato fries because on the ticket; it didn't say that I ordered them and apparently it's a dollar extra for sweet potato fries. Umm; yes I'm sure I know what I ordered. And really? A dollar for sweet potato fries? Most restaurants just sub the two. Either way; it was clearly their mistake and she could have been more accommodating or just gave me the sweet potato fries and lost a dollar. I was with a bunch of my coworkers who had never gone before and I was really excited for them to try it out. The service we got did not leave the best taste in their mouths. They also got a few other orders wrong but we didn't say anything because we already saw how unhelpful they were with me.   Strike three; some of us went back up to the counter to order dessert and cheese curds because no one had them before and wanted to try them out. The man who brought us the desert took our number holder and we pointed out to him that we had more food coming too and he said; \I just do the desserts.\   That's kind of a weird system and seems very inefficient. Why wouldn't you just bring one cement mixer and one cheese curd out at the same time? He finally understood that we still needed the number on our table for our other food and left.   This one girl also kept coming by as we were waiting for our food asking if we needed anything else. Um; our food? But really; what else would we need? It was really awkward that she kept asking since everything is pretty much self served.  So overall; their food is really good and I'm so glad they opened near me. Their service on the other hand sucked. Hope they fix it soon!   ",0.0,0.0
0,Awful! This is basically DQ on steroids. I asked the counter server about a few items which he had no idea about anything. Wife ordered chicken strip dinner $9 and it was essentially frozen Tyson chicken out of a bag; gross!!!! Fries were cold and soggy. I just got chili $4 for a little container and it was basically Wendy's. For $13 fast foot for 2 little items and crap food; it's a joke. Oddly; we looked around the place and noticed most diners were a bit obese; think it must be a place for mid westerners.  Won't ever be back; would rather go to habit burger or in-n-out or even McDonald's for that matter. This place is a joke.,0.0,0.0

0,What a fantastic location and the customer service is fantastic.  Why?  The person that took us under his wing was Bob; the 2nd Assistant Manager and he went far beyond the norm.  We have daughter that is allergic to soy; gluten and dairy and both black beans and pinto beans so you can imagine the difficulty with getting her the proper nutrition and the right amount of protein.  When we told Bob our needs he said that he could take the fish; and cook it adding only lemon juice and a little olive oil.  That was great but he even went further; he cleaned the part of the grill that he used to remove any gluten or soy residue and had the person that makes salads use new gloves (no residue from gluten or soy).  So the meal was great and the service even better.  Thank you Bob.   As others with allergies know it is difficult to find locations to go to and get good food. So I recommend this Culver's  at Shea and the 101.,1.0,1.0

All the sandwiches I saw being made looked ridiculously good! I had the Big Kahuna which is their Philly Cheesesteak with mushrooms and jalapenos added. Now I dont understand the people complaining about not getting your money's worth? Are you kidding me?? This isnt Taco Bell?? Its a friggin sub shop. $14 for 2  well endowed subs is expensive? If this is too rich for your blood. try the dollar menu at Jack in The Box. Or are you one of those that prefer the entire animal in your sandwich (ex. Miracle Mile/Jason's Deli) Ridiculous! Their egular\   size is approx an 8 inch sub and they're far from stingy. One average sized person will be more than satisfied with a \  regular\   sandwich???. Seriously to have to order a Large or have chips on top of your regular is just unnecessary spending and overkill on the food front. It's like people are brainwashed into thinking you have to have a side with everything you eat.. Im not cheap Im just not overeating...If you can eat a regular + add ons....you're either planning for leftovers; an athlete; a grown man; trying to gain weight;  or are friggin stoned !  As for other comments about it being soggy. Yes it was a bit but not falling apart or seemingly dipped in au jus soggy. My \  grinder\   was fan freakin tastic!
