nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,I saw someone with a Jersey Mike's box the other day or I wouldn't have known they existed.  I was told to try the place as the subs they got there were the best they had had for a long time.   I had to make a decision whether to go their or AJ's this week.  I have to tell you Jersey Mike's had two strikes against it before I walked in there so I almost didn't.   I am not a big sub person.  Usually the bread is satisfactory but that is about it.  The second strike is most places that advertise themselves as being from a specific area offer a product  you really have to develop a taste for  if you are ever really going to enjoy it.  Maybe if you are from there... ?  I was about that far from not going in...  I am glad that I did.  They don't offer all the toppings one might find at the other large chains. Only two kinds of bread?  The difference is in the quality of what they do offer.  That by far makes up the difference.  I had a toasted veggie wrap and really enjoyed it.  Everything was fresh and crisp without an overpowering ranch dressing.  Nice fresh bread that tasted like it had been baked that day.  Enough to fill you up without making you feel stuffed.  I have no problems with the thought of going back.    One more plus for Jersey Mike's.  I had to wait longer than I expected.  When I finally did get my order; I mentioned it was my first time there.  I was immediately told they were shorthanded and got an apology for having had to wait as long as I did.  That really impressed me as they were really busy and it was genuine; not lip service.     Nice place.,1

nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,I am updating my review to 5 stars based on customer service. After I wrote my review based on my last visit; I was contacted by Duane; who was kind enough to address my concern and generously offered to pay for my meal. That kind of customer service is practically unheard of these days as should be recognized; especially in a fast food establishment. Duane; Jersey Mikes is lucky to have you and I thank you again for your genuine concern for your customers! You have won us back! :),1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,I am giving one star because the other employees at this store are wonderful. This is regarding my previous concern about the rude; sarcastic; intimidating; unprofessional MANAGER.  First; let me say I recognize my order is a little particular. I ask for extra stuff; but I have iterated over and over I am more than happy to PAY for it; and I am patient; gracious; grateful; and tip the maximum EVERY time I go in. Ok; I didn't yesterday because I actually feel intimidated by that jerk.  That being said; my husband usually goes for me so I don't have to deal with that guy because he has never failed to make it clear his disdain for me. But thinking enough time had passed; I started going in occasionally. Save for one time last week when it appeared HIS supervisor was sitting there (cue the complete show of syrupy sweetness); he is consistently rude; barking orders at employees; and huffing and puffing if you ask for anything that might annoy him.  In addition to this incredibly unprofessional attitude;  he is willing to share personal information about employees. He related to my husband a female employee (who was always very nice) was fired because she 'was stealing points and giving them to her mother to use'.  I don't care if she did; you don't need an MBA to know you do not share that type of information.  Given the qualities that this location seeks in their management; I will never be returning. I have never in my life felt intimidated at anyplace I patronize reguarly and I am actually concerned he might do something to my food. I can see from other reviews I am not alone. I gave you another chance and my patience has run out.,0
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,Service was lacking; we were the only people in the place and had to hear about the two gentlemen talk about the schedule for a few minutes before we were even greeted. Ordered two small subs with small drinks and chips. I had a philly style beef with spicy sauce; the Kahuna or something. It was meh; ok. I won't be back because I spent over $20.00.,0

nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,$10.10 for Miss Vickers Chips; 22 ounce soda; and a 7 inch sub.   Whoa!   Sub was all bread and lettuce.   Skimpy skimpy skimpy!   Service was fine; but I will not be going back when I can go to Subway for a 12 inch sub plus drink and chips for $7.00  .   Sorry Jersey Mike; but yous no good.,0
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,Awesome guys! Always fun and making jokes with us. Meat and cheese sliced fresh when you order and I love that I can customize my thickness. Great spot for a quick sandwich at lunchtime. Just sad they dont have black olives or sweet peppers.,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,I came here on a Friday to feast on a Philly cheesesteak; had it with the onions and peppers on white bread.It was phenomenal! So much that I spent the whole weekend dreaming about it. And so I convinced my co-workers we needed to eat here for lunch the following Monday.  I ordered the Philly again on white bread w/ onions and peppers; but this time w/ chicken as the filling. Wow! It was delicious! The bread was not soggy. And both sandwiches were flavorful. It was well worth the $7 plus change spent.,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,Love this Sub shop and the location on Central and Camrlback.. 10/10 on customer service; 10/10 on food quality; 10/10 on facility cleanliness! This the place to be if you want awesome service and great food.,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,I went in the early afternoon and got incredibly fast and friendly service.  The food is always good and fresh.  They seem to have a lot of turnover in employees; so I never see the same face twice; but the food certainly doesn't seem to suffer.  They even secret menu options ... if that's something you enjoy  :-),1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,Found out this place finally open so some friends and I here at the office decided to give it a try.... Ordered online... very quick and easy.... Order was ready when requested.... just to add... I had an order of 11 sandwiches.... As there where packing all the sandwiches in a single large bag; I was going to order a drink; and the kind gentleman offered it to me for free.. nice!!.... Got back to the office and everyone was happy... all sandwiches where made to perfection and as requested... nothing missing nothing extra... The Philly was perfect; but I would suggest that you order extra cheese on it if you like'em cheesy.... we will definitely be returning in the near future..,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,Staff were over the top on customer service. The best part; I think they were being genuine. Food was good. Low key kinda place; patio seating is a nice option for people watching!!,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,The employee that decided to make fun of another employee took away from what is a usually very good experience at this location.  The young man making the sandwich was being very friendly; asked all the right things to make sure everything would be made correctly and was a pleasure. Then another employee started saying and asking things that made it clear that he was making fun of him or taunting him. The first employee looked shaken up by this but continued his excellent customer service.   Other employees got quiet and busy to stay out of it.  Food is always great; but manager should be checking out this kind of treatment by one employee to another.,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,The staff was very friendly. The quality of food was great. However; I received the least amount of meat I have gotten in my giant 9. I didn't order a giant to get 6 pieces of turkey; 6 pieces of roast beef; and 4 strips of bacon... I go to jersey mikes in San Diego a lot. I've never gotten a tiny sandwich like this one.,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,This was my friend's first time eating here. We walked in about 30 minutes to close when two employees; not paying attention to the door; were cleaning the grill. My friend ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. The employee told him he just put that stuff away. Which makes sense that he didn't want to re-clean the grill. So he reluctantly ordered a cold sub as anything hot would require re-dirtying the grill.  It's a shame that that he wasn't able to get the sandwich he really wanted because the workers were obviously trying to be out the door the minute they close. He will probably not be back.,0
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,Been here many times & would normally give it at least 3 stars but went in 5 minutes before it close & asked if it was too late & they said no.  Told them I don't want to keep them but they said it was fine.  Ordered a HOT buffalo chicken wrap which female cook dropped tortilla on grill for half a second & put it on paper then grilled chicken for 5 SECONDS on each side (her words). HOT wrap was ice cold.  When I asked isn't it  suppose to be hot she said all the condiments were cold & she cooked the meat 5 seconds on each side.  I will go again but not order if she is cooking.,1
nRzZac3LVgANpKPkDs4LSQ,"This place has wonderful sandwiches; always does.  That is why I will continue to go there.  Went there last week to pick up a call ahead order; as I was paying; with a credit card; the kid checking me out showed me where I could tip; but \no pressure\"" as he eyeballed each button press and was dissapointed as I chose no thank you.   I understand wanting to tip if you get great service; but be serious you are a sandwich shop.  Is it necessary to have to say no thanks on a tip while checking out with a credit card??  What were they wanting 20% to hand me a bag?  Eliminate the tip option on the credit card check out screens and 5 stars on a sandwich shop.  Sandwich shop...""",0

LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Damn; I feel like a fat pig. That might be the only meal I need today! Being a nice weather; Friday kind of day I headed to the ASU campus to give the newly opened Smashburger a try. I have no prior Smashburger experience; but it was a new place to Yelp and I love me a burger.  I drove; and parking is a bit tricky if you do not want to pay for the parking garage. Fortunately I found a spot down the street in the 25 cents per 10 minute parking meters. The restaurant is in a good location -  plenty of traffic from foot; car and bus. Being right off campus I am sure it will be a big hit with students. Once inside; I found the restaurant small and cramped. The line was to the door (probably being new; being Friday and being noon didn't help). I placed an eat-in order and waited by a large table with several people gathered around. Looking around; all tables were full. Counting the large table; there were only 11 tables inside and a bar that seated 3 in the back. Glancing outside; the patio seating was full as well.   I ordered the Arizona smashburger - which comes in 1/3 lb or  1/2 pound sizes. The 1/3 pound is $5.99 while the larger size is just a dollar more; so I went large. The burger comes with habanero cheese; guacamole; lettuce; tomato; onion; chipotle mayo; jalapenos and a chipotle bun. I could taste the guacamole; but the most noticable taste for me was the strong onions. The jalapenos were not noticeable.  I also ordered the smashfries which as small; thin fries seasoned with rosemary; olive oil; garlic and \other herbs\""...Safe to say no one is kissing me immediately after eating this meal.  After placing my order and waiting at the table for it to arrive; I then had to wait for a table to open up. It might take a bit of waiting to get seated; so be prepared. If you go with more than one person; it would be best to collect the orders and have one person scout for a table.   You definitely need two hands and a stack of napkins for this monster! Honestly it was difficult to wrangle - meat sticking out of the bun in all directions; guacamole sliding out; slippery tomatos and the mayo made for one messy sandwich - but I pushed through and eventually got a good grasp on the beast. I think it may be the best burger I have ever purchased. I would put it up against any backyard burger I have had in my day. The fries were simply amazing! I love rosemary and the combination of ingredients was unique and flavorful.   Another aspect of the restaurant was that it was a little loud. Most likely not a good spot to go if you want to meet and get to know someone through introductory conversation...then again the oozing of quacamole down the face probably wouldn't make a good first impression either...  All totalled; with burger  ($6.99); fries ($1.79 with sandwich purchase) and drink ($1.69) came in with tax at $11.39. A little higher than a standard fast food burger; but 10 times the taste! If you are not into burgers; they have chicken; salads and hot dogs to choose from. If you don't want one of the standard 5 burgers; you can create your own. Definitely a good option...  If you want a good burger experience; give a Smashburger (and Smashfries!) a try!!""",0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Great place to grab a bite to eat when on ASU campus. I usually just order a kids meal because for the price you pay you get normal size hot dog; side of fries and small soda... which is more than enough to fill me up!   The staff at this specific location are really nice too!,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,This was a very good burger. I ordered the 1/3lb Arizona special with a fried egg. They cook their Angus beef burger at a high heat with a crispy finish; and it tasted great!  Also ordered a side of their herb yam fries which were very good.  They also have Tazo iced tea; which was a nice touch. This location is a bit of a pain; since there is no free parking (it is in a parkade; so you can get some shade by parking in there). The burgers are $5.99 with an extra $1.99 for fries or yam fries.,0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Well I just had to make a special trip out to the Valley's first Smashburger.  I love a good burger and while nothing really competes with the Fez Burger; this place will be making a run for the top spot.  Walking in; this place is pretty nice.  The color scheme is a bit of a nod to the traditional diner but without all of the red leather bar stools and diamondplate.  That's a good thing.  The people are very friendly and helpful (plus there were plenty on staff).  The menu is available outside (which I like because it helps make the line go a bit quicker) and they have a build-your-own card for your personalized burger creations.  In other words; they do everything that the Two Hippes Breakfast Joint doesn't.  Pretty sweet.  The food took 3-5minutes or so to come out.  We ordered ours To-Go but ended up eating outside.  It comes in a nicely packaged; especially if you were going to a picnic or something like that.  Nice presentation for to-go.  I ordered the Arizona Smashburger which was pretty much what you would expect it to be (no; not dusty).  Semi-ironically; this burger is called the Baja Burger elsewhere but the premise is the same - guacamole; peperjack; chipotle mayo; jalapenos on a chipotle bun.  Gotta say; this was actually on the slightly spicy side.  A nice change of pace from places that claim to have spicy food but never do.    The burger part of this meal was the best part.  Not only was it cooked to a perfect medium (you might want to specify if you like it more done) but it was a big juicy patty.  You could tell it had been a ball of meat that had literally been smashed into its current form.  Just like I make at home.  The burger was a bit on the salty side around the edges.  Not sure what that was about but I LIKED IT!  Really it was a damn tasty burger.  Finally; we also ordered some \veggie fries\"" which I sort of expected to be like veggie crisps.  They were just fried veggies.  Carrots and asparagus cut into little sticks with some salt.  It was good & came with some ranch dressing.  Simply not what I expected.  The final big plus about this place is its location.  Very happy to see a new place by a LRT stop.  You can never have too many restaurants by the LRT and having this one so close to the Vet/College stop will be great for football lovers; ASU students; and LRT riders like myself.  Well done Smashburger.  Bring on the chains.""",1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"could have been a 2 star rating because of the cleanliness; but realized that another chain burger joint charging $10 for an average burger didn't deserve it; especially when the burger is served with a side of sarcasm. not to mention that they are not community friendly at all. I asked to drop some flyers for the Grand Avenue Festival and they said no; not that they needed to say yes; but when I asked the manager to talk with the franchise managers about being a little more community involved and supportive; the manager barked very rudely \none of the businesses around here do that\""; which was a lie because just next door on college- Port Of Subs and the Cupz Coffee both allow people to leave flyers for their customers; so did the Hawaiian place and almost every other business around. I had to give this a 1 star because Arizona doesn't need another over priced; community sucker; who is not interested in creating a community; but just bleeding the money and running. he was so unfriendly and sarcastic that I didn't even want to place my order after that. i'll stick with Maizie's burgers anyday! I also heard the Grind on Camelback Rd  next to the Fenix eatery at about 40th street was the shiznitz! They said its hands down the best in town....on my way soon.""",0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,This place is right down the street from my office; convenient right? Well maybe if there weren't other burger choices. Have tried the burgers and onion strings; both of which are overly salty; and the onions extremely soggy with grease.   The layout of the place is also really awkward. You come in and order and them wait for your food....except the is no where to wait? You kind of stand between their expediter; others waiting and right next to diners. They need a much better system. Prices also seem a little high...$10+ for a burger; fries & drink.,0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Last night I was invited to Smashburger as a VIP (YAY) and was able to partake in some of their menu items for free. Now me pass up a free meal; hmm NEVER!   So I mosey on to Tempe after sitting in traffic for about an hour (boooo) but was able to snag a great parking space and made my way into Smashburger. My first impression was that it was cute little place and yes it is a bit small but cute for a burger place. I met up with Christina; who by the way was fabulous. (Thank you Christina for inviting me) and she gave me a menu; told me about the place and let me know that anything I wanted was on the house. Gotta love that right? The first thing I asked her was \ where is the ladies room?'\"" In which she informed me that it was actually outside; around the corner as that is how the restaurants are set up on College Ave. If you could have seen the look on my face. WOW! So after getting what has to be the biggest bathroom key ring I have EVER seen; I made my way around the corner to the ladies room. Although it was well lit; it still creeped me out that I had to go around the corner and kinda towards the back. Although it was very clean; still not really comfortable with that but again I guess that is how it is on College Ave. 1 star   Any-who; I proceeded to order the following food to try out and here they are:   Chocolate Milkshake - OMG! I don't even like Haagen -Daz ice cream (that is what the shakes are made with) and let me tell you that this was the BEST chocolate milkshake I have had in a very long time. Think; rich; and oh so good. 5 stars   Smashfries- they are made with rosemary; olive oil; garlic and other herbs. I was a little bummed as depending on which fry I picked up it was either cold; warm; or hot. Not consistent! 1star   Onion stack - Now I love me some onion rings but I didn't get to try them because when I got them guess what; they were COLD!!! I was so disappointed. How do you get cold onion rings? Double boo!! 0 stars   Arizona Smashburger- I had the 1/2 lb one and it had habanero cheese; guacamole; onions; chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun. (I did not have the lettuce and tomato but it comes with that too) OMG! That was one good burger. Nice and spicy; the bun was way to small for that burger but it was so good. A chipotle bun? Who knew! The seasonings that they put on this burger made it really pop. I was thoroughly happy with it. 5 stars!   I did meet Greg and Kirk; (Regional Vice President and Franchise Owner in that order I believe) and I did express my thoughts on my meal; especially my fries and onion rings. They did offer to bring me out more and apologized profusely; but I declined as I did not want to waste any more food even if it was free as I there was no way I was going to be able to anything else after that burger and milkshake. 5 stars   Oh and the best part of the night; I got to meet fellow yelper Alexander C. and his friend Erin and I was able to go in the back and smash my own burger! That was very cool! 5 stars   So all in all; a few quirks regarding hot fries and onions rings; but the burgers were really good. Its a little pricey as well so be warned. They are opening up a couple more in the next few months. One on 99th Ave and McDowell; and one on 20th St and Camelback so be on the lookout. These locations will have wine and beer added as well.""",1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I ordered the classic smash burger with bacon; smash fries and sweet potato smash fries.  The burger was flavorful; had a nice char on the outside and tender on the inside; and was cooked as ordered (medium well); which i appreciated. As for the fries; both were tossed with rosemary; olive oil & garlic - YUM!  The only thing I didn't like was my butterfinger shake; which tasted nothing like a butterfinger - it was a watery; vanilla milkshake with a few pieces of butterfinger mixed-in - LAME!,0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Simple; satisfying and easy on the wallet; what's not to love about a well-cooked juicy slab of beef between two freshly baked buns? While some burgers are better than others; there usually isn't much to tell them apart.  Now comes Smashburger; the latest and certainly not the last; burger concept that distinguishes itself not by its number of fancy toppings; but by its cooking method.  Smashburger is located in Tempe; next to the ASU campus; where there is more eye candy than free parking. (There is a parking structure nearby with a $3 fee for the first hour.)  Smashburger's name pretty much says it all. The restaurant takes 100 percent ground Angus beef and; using a spatula; literally smashes it onto the cook top. The idea is to quickly sear the meat so that the juices are sealed inside the burger.  I was skeptical of the cooking method since smashing a burger forces juices out during cooking; causing a dry burger. But the staff was all smiles; friendly and showing a genuine eagerness to help.  After only a few bites of my half-pound Classic Smashburger ($5.99); I was convinced that their cooking method is sound -- it makes for a tasty burger. Hanging over the edges of the bun; the meat did remain juicy; with that slightly salty beefiness that I know and love.  If you're really hungry; you can add another half-pound patty for $3. Now that's a burger!  Smashfries ($1.79 when ordered with a sandwich); tossed with olive oil; garlic and rosemary; were an instant hit. The Haystack Onions were limp and too salty.  Chicken sandwiches; salads and hot dogs are also on he menu.  The Arizona Devil Dog ($3.99) is a Hebrew National 100 percent beef hot dog slathered with spicy guacamole; habanero cheese; jalapenos and onions on a toasted poppy-seed bun. Oh; the burn!  To cool things off; Smashburger makes Häagen-Dazs milkshakes ($3.99) in four flavors -- vanilla; chocolate; strawberry and cactus vanilla (prickly pear). The shakes are rich; creamy and decadent.  Being a fast-casual restaurant; customers order at the counter; then find a seat. In a short while; someone will bring out your grub.  The smallish dining space is modern in an accessible chain store kind of way. Be warned; there are no public restrooms in this store; so be sure to bring your own hand sanitizer.  So; contrary to popular belief; smashing is actually; well; quite smashing.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,So I am not a fan of fast food. My husband and 2 young boys wanted to try Smash Burger (777 E College Ave; Tempe; AZ) before we went to the airport and they somehow convinced me to go.  It was a Monday 12:30pm so it was very crowded. We ordered our lunch but had to wait for a table to open. Our food was almost ready and my young boys were getting restless; but still no table. The cook in the back came out with fries and gave them to my boys to hold them over -- nice touch. The manager and 1 other person were hustling to clear and clean tables so that we could sit down faster. We sat down and boy was I surprised at what appeared on the table! Fresh; hot burgers and the most delicious fries seasoned with a hint of rosemary. My sons also ordered a chocolate shake which looked mouth watering!  I have never experienced tastier food; friendlier staff or for that matter; staff that hustle; as much as I experienced at the 777 E. College Ave location on Mon 3/19; 12:30pm  My only complaint is that there is not a Smashburger location in the city limits of Chicago! We cannot wait to return!,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,This review is long overdue!  I actually first came here when they just opened; maybe even on the first day.  I absolutely loved it then; and I absolutely loved it again when we came for Office Hours!  Both times I have been here I have ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger and the Veggie Frites.  So far; at least to me; this is the best burger in the Valley.  They season their burgers so much that it tiptoes along the lines of overkill; but I like it.  The burger is always juicy and fresh and the toppings are killer.  The BBQ sauce is thick and sweet and the perfect complement to the salty bacon and fried onion strings sitting atop the meat.  This is really a fantastic burger.  The Veggie Frites are yummy; especially the asparagus because the tops of them get all crispy.  They serve them with a generous side of ranch.  Yum!  Obviously; I love this place.  I am soooo excited to get one of these so close to downtown; but that is going to be a very dangerous thing.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Another new addition to Tempe and about a quarter mile or so from Mill ave and very close to ASU.  This is in the newer section of ASU on College and University and is very close to the dorms or a quick bite before a game.  The interior is a bit small and could easily crowd up fast and there is some seating outside. Food is pretty good and definitely stands out from the normal fast food fare.  My burger was crispy on the outside; but still juicy in the middle; which is part of the Smashburger namesake and style that they are known for.  There is a decent amount of variety between the types of burgers or chicken sandwiches that can be ordered.  Fries are a bit on the limp/soggy side and could use some improvement; but the option for garlic and rosemary was pretty cool (needs more garlic; though).  The shakes are amazing and almost too rich for a place of this caliber and really made Smashburger stand out as a restaurant/dining option.  Haagen-dasz ice cream shake in vanilla; chocolate; strawberry or mixed up creates a very tasty side or dessert.,0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,So; how much do you like hamburgers?  Do you like them enough to pay $8 for one?  Do you like them enough to willingly go near ASU?  If you're still nodding your head; chances are good that you'll like Smashburger.    As burger joints go; it's one of the nicer ones--clean; stylish decor; and friendly employees are big pluses here.  You will pay for those pluses though; when you find yourself forking over more than $10 for the prototypical burger; fries; and high fructose corn syrup drink of your choice.    What you'll get for that ten-spot is somewhat distinctive though.  Smashburger's claim to fame; of course; is the way that they seer the burger patty; thus getting it piping hot in a hurry.  What this means for you is that you'll be the proud owner of one of the messier burgers in America.  Grab plenty of napkins and plan to wear a shirt you don't mind getting greasy.    I suppose the fries are a love em'/hate 'em affair.  If you're a traditionalist; prepare to be annoyed:  Smashfries are doused in oil and herbs.  They make a nice taste; but get old pretty quickly and I've never been able to finish an order.  Though hardly cheap or perfect; I like Smashburger on occasion as it's a nice change from the usual fast food fare.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,The food is good; though the burgers are a *tad* on the greasy side. I get a kid's meal and it fills me up perfectly. Staff is always nice; even when there's a rush; but there's no place to stand and wait for a take out order aside from next to the soda fountain and trash.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Excellent! Great customer service and good eats. Do yourself a favor and just try it one time.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I was excited to try Smashburger today for the first time after a meeting; but I have to say...I've experienced better.    The menu is decent with enough variety to choose from to keep people coming back (you can choose to have a 1/3 lb; 1/2 lb; or chicken burger for a kind of 'burger'); but there are better burger places to make this place someplace I'd want to keep returning.  First off; there are no combo meals.  You have to get everything a la carte; but if you buy a side with a burger; you get $1 off the side.  Still; I got a 1/3 lb mushroom burger with veggie frites; and I paid about $10.  No drink included.  At a place that is technically fast-food.  And THAT was supposed to be a deal.  Second; the veggie frites were kind of soggy.  There was no crispity crunchy outing that I would have expected from fried veggies.  And they were a bit salty.  And Smashburger was kind of stingy about how much they gave me.  The dip they gave me for the frites were good; though.  I dipped the burger in it; too.  I mean; the employees are friendly; the food is made to order so it's fresh; you have the freedom to basically make your own burger; and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good; which is all great; but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible; better overall value can be found someplace else.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"It's no secret that I love me a good cheeseburger  so I was excited to try a new place. New to me anyway :)  My first impression of the place is they could use a hand. It was kinda busy (Friday lunchtime) but there were only two people in front of me in line and it still took forever. Partly because when I finally got up to front the one guy taking orders had to stop to make shakes. Another guy finally came out after a few minutes and took my order. So they're not the fastest place in town.  But; I was happy to see their menu featured a \build your own\"" option. I like my burger relatively plain so I ordered the regular bun; american cheese; tomato; lettuce and mayo. I also ordered a side of the smashfries. Who could turn down fries with olive oil and rosemary? Not this girl.  The burger was juicy and tasted fresh but was a bit on the salty side. The boyfriend and friend both said theirs were not too salty so it was just mine I guess. It happens.  The fries were tasty; thin cut and came out nice and hot. Reminded me a little of McDonald's fries but with oil and rosemary. The boyfriend had the onion strings which were also a little on the salty side. Maybe the cook that day just really likes salt?  If it weren't for the over-saltiness of my burger I would have thought it was quite tasty so I'm willing to try Smashburger again. And the manager walked by several times asking how our food was. I probably should have said something but it wasn't bad enough that I didn't eat it so I can't be too hard on them.""",1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"After seeing this place reviewed on Yelp; I felt it was time to stop by and check it out.  I'm a burger loving kind of gal; and am always on the hunt for a good peice of meat.  This place definately has it going on.  After finding a place to park in the garage; I wandered into Smashburger and was happy to see that it was a clean new place. Ample menu of items to choose from; with a small variety of burgers; a hot dog or two and some chicken options as well.  I was torn between the BBQ burger and the All American.  I went with the All American; and boy; was it good.  Good came out quick and service was great.  Ya know what else?  They had a bunch of Yelp pens here at the register!!  This brought a smile to my face! Yippie!  What I really liked about this place is the burger is juicy; and not dry or \corporate\"" tasting.  I didn't feel like it was to greasy either.  I found it to actually have flavor on its own as well.  Worth a stop here.  I should also mention that this is review #300 for me.  Ya wanna know what else?  I hit 3000 miles on my car yesterday.  Cool; huh?  Possibly a sign; but quite cool that I am doing review #300 and hit 3000 miles on my car in the same day.  Cool.""",1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"I AM AN OFFICIAL YELPER!!!!!!   whew; now that I got that out of my system I need to thank Gabi for inviting us cool hip yelpers to Smash Burger. This was my first yelp event. I went with Don S. for some good ol' father daughter yelping bonding. Between the great people; the wonderful conversation; and general excitement; I have to say this was a wonderful lunch out.  Now for the niddy griddy. You might be asking yourself \Whassup? Why didn't they get 5 stars if it was a great lunch event?\"" or \""whahappened?\"" as they say in my family.  My main judging points with restaurants and bars is food and service. I've eaten in dumpy little hole in the walls but would give them 5 stars cause the food was great and so was the service.  Here at Smashburger; the service was most certainly friendly. We were greeted with a smile and fairly quickly. Off to a great start. I started to look at the menu; and it was very interesting. They had fried veggies (which I really like and highly recommend). But here is where it totally lost me. there were no vegetarian options. For a college town; I found this to be weird. Where's the love guys? So I was forced to construct a burger without the meat. The lady at the front was as kind as she could be; but looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out from my ears. All in all the food was great; and my specialty meal was made very well. But show the vegetarians some love! I mean come on!""",1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Why  not another star?....tooo much oil!. Fries come dripping oil! No objection to the fact they have herb Seasoning.  The rest; it is just another burger served in a fancy way. All tastes good; but I certainly won't be a client.   Service is really nice; and the place is clean and at least you can enjoy your meal; eating with no rush; like it usually happens in the red/orange/yellow colored places.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Damn you cheeseburgers and how good you taste; I would be a healthier person if this deliciousness were never invented.  At least at Smashburger I have the option to negate the damage that I may be doing to my health when I eat their awesome; juicy; tasty cheeseburger by ordering their mixed-vegetable side instead of their fries.    Don't get me wrong; the fries are good.  I haven't tried the Smash Fries yet; but given the great flavor of everything else that I've eaten at Smashburger; I would imagine that those seasoned fries are damned good too.  Nevertheless; opting for the asparagus/ string beans/ carrots mixture is a good way to fool yourself into believing that you are eating a light and healthy lunch.  I was also fooled when I saw my Smashburger.  Perhaps the tray that it came on was an optical illusion; but when my 1/3 lb. burger was brought to my table I thought that maybe I didn't order enough food for lunch.  Yet when I was half way through my meal I definitely realized that I had more than enough food to eat.    Just like many other new fast food restaurant concepts that are popping up all over the place; the food at Smashburger tastes as though it is fresh and of very high quality.  In the same vein; the food definitely tasted as though it was made explicitly for my order and had never seen a warming tray or a microwave.  I only wish that there were more Smashburgers in the Valley because when ASU goes back into session I would imagine that it will be very difficult to grab a quick lunch at this restaurant.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Smashburger being within walking distance from my work is pure temptation. Just this past week I met some friends here for a quick bite.  I ended up ordering the 1/3 pound classic smashburger with haystack onions as an add-on. I had to go with the smash fries; and am really glad I did. The smashfries are tossed with olive oil; rosemary; garlic and \other herbs.\"" Hmmm what are those other herbs? I would travel the world to find out what- that's how good they are. Almost as good as the fries at Fez :-)  To top it off; the manager checked in on our table multiple times to bring us back any condiments; ask us what we thought about the burgers; and to see if we needed anything else. Loved  the service!  Thanks for coming to the Valley Smashburger. We heart you!""",1

LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I never get chips; or fries. Usually just a drink. This place makes me get the amazing sweet potato fries with olive oil and rosemary..their burgers come second to lobby's; though; and the service at this location is shitty at best. If you want to try smashburger; try the tempe marketplace location or the one on rural. This one also has zero parking; for you car drivers.,0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,As I walk down University Avenue along the ASU campus I see the usual suspects; coffee houses; bookstores; and oodles of fast food joints.  Today there is a new kid in town.  Smashburger.  A fresh take on the classic fast food burger joint; Smashburger offers made-to-order burgers; Rosemary; olive oil; garlic fries (Smashfries); and Haagen-Dazs shakes.  Every Smashburger is made when it's ordered; so don't come here if you are late to class; the wait from order to delivery is about five to seven minutes; and you'll want to take your time enjoying these burgers.  Smashburger takes a different approach to burger preparation - they start with a one-third or half pound ball of 100% fresh Angus beef; smash; sear; and season it on a flat grill; then serve it on a buttered-toasted artisan bun and top it with cheese; fresh produce and condiments. The result is an irregularly shaped; juicy; delicious burger.  I stopped down there today for the grand opening and tried the BBQ; Bacon; &amp; Cheese Smashburger ($5.99) with Smashfries ($1.79); and Veggie Frites ($2.99).  Right away I noticed that the Smashburger differentiates itself from other burgers with ambrosial seasonings and juiciness.  Yes; this burger was juicier than Perez Hilton gossip at a Hollywood red carpet event.  These guys really have the searing down to a science.  A few other points of interest - the Smashfries are delicious; the whole rosemary; garlic; oil coating really works well.  Points for the Veggie Frites; too.  You get a nice blend of asparagus; carrots; and green beans; which are flash fried and seasoned; then served hot to your table. They offer a few other menu items including a Smashchicken sandwiches; Smashdogs; and Smashsalads (if you're into that healthy stuff).  If Smashburger has a weakness; it's the hours of operation.  I mean; come on.. you are operating on a college campus and closing at 10 PM every night?  Seriously?  One thing ASU needs are more places to soak up all that alcohol after a long night on the sauce.  I'll give Smashburger a half point back for opening at 10 AM to help cure the hangover the next day.  I have a feeling that a smashed; seared burger and greasy coated fries may remedy the brown bottle flu.  Overall; Smashburger is a hit and is sure to win the hearts and minds of hungry college students roaming the streets of Tempe; Arizona.,0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I always wanted to try this place because its always busy so I assumed it was really good. We stopped by after a long hot day walking around ASU so we were really hot tired and hungry. I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and my kids had the Avocado club crispy chicken. Very disappointed because it seemed like portions of the burger was really salty and other bites had no salt so I didn't think it was very good. The chicken sandwich was also pretty salty. The fries are cut very thin and I don't think they were very good. Nothing to write home about. Overall I wasn't impressed at all by the food.  The service on the other hand was great. He was very friendly; patient and helpful which I appreciate. He even gave us free drinks because he saw how hot; tired and flush we were so I thought that was nice. They were very good in cleaning the tables so that new customers could sit down. I could get a better burger at another place next time.,1

The burger was nice and juicy and the fries were nice and crispy.   Service was very good. Very friendly when ordering and the food came in decent amount of time. Even had people come over to ask how the food was. Not really used to that for a fast food place.   I would say that I enjoyed my meal today and glad I gave it another try. Another option for burgers is always nice.,1

LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Being a self proclaimed burger junkie; I have to weigh in on where Smashburger fits into the valley burger scene.  First off; if your litmus test for a good burger is price; you probably shouldn't be rating burger joints.  Remember people; the only reason you expect to pay next to nothing for a burger is because McDowell's has trained you to believe that a great burger is cheap!  Good food costs so stick to the fast food chains if you are looking for a $3.99 value meal.  Now; for those of us serious about our burgers; Smashburger is definitely a place to put on your list of must visits.  I have only visited the University location so other SB's may have bigger dining areas; but the University location is sorely lacking in space.  Between the hassle of parking and finding a seat; you would be well advised to go before or after the ASU lunch hour.  That being said; the burgers are worth it.  Not sure if I buy into the whole \smashing the patty on the grill\"" makes a big difference; but I will say that one taste will tell you that the ingredients are fresh and the meat is real beef - not a frozen pre made patty.  There aren't many choices for toppings but the presence of a fried egg option and jalepeno's should keep most burger lovers happy.  The fries are ok and include Sweet Potato options but the burger is the star here.  The shakes are good too but this is clearly where the profit is being generated.  Service is good but they could use another register during lunch hour as the line extends outside of the restaurant during lunch.  Other than that minor hassle; there isn't any reason that you can't get your Smash on too!""",1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Been here twice now and i have to say this i a pretty good burger but the smashfries are the true star. The first time I went i got a made to order burger adding lettuce; tomato; grilled onion; cheddar; smash sauce; pickle and bacon on a 1/3 pound burger and traditional bun. This was a good juicy burger with the bacon being pretty tasty. It was also pretty filling for it's size.  The next time i got the arizona burger which is a 1/3 pound burger; peper jack cheese(?); chipotle mayo; guacamole; lettuce; onion; jalepeno; and some spicy bun the type escapes me. The flavors worked well together and i was impressed that while a spicy flavor came through so did each individual element. Even with the jalepenos there wasn't a really fire or burn to overpower the burger but a nice heat. It was a good specialty burger but i would prefer grilled onions on it.  The thing that will keep me coming back however is that smashfries which are great and the rosemary and garlic taste is just a perfect balance. No ketchup needed here the flavors are enough themselves. I have had the fries at 5 Guys; Delux; Joe's farm grill and these may be my favorite.  Also a nice touch with the close location to ASU is that they do except sun dollars. For a price that falls between McDonalds and more gourmet burger places this is a winner for flavor and value. With other choices like Chuckbox; 5 Guys; Whataburger; and 4 Peaks in the area this still is the best.,0
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Customer service was excellent! I only got the sweet potato smash fries which were like garlic fries! They were good under $3.,1
LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Super super friendly staff and extremely fast service! The staff is always really considerate and remembers what regulars like to order. I recommend all the milkshakes and root beer float. Be sure to show your ASU ID for a student discount on the Classic Smash meal.,1

LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,This is more of a quick post than a full review as I only spent a few minutes in this place. I was next door at port of subs and decided to try the smashfries that I had heard so much about. As I walked in I was greeted by a friendly college age employee who was more than happy to answer any questions I had. I placed my order and sat back in one of their booths near the door and waited for my fries to be ready.   This location is really small and can get crowed fast as they are super close to ASU. I gave this place three stars because the cook staff took a really long time to make my order; and the fries were kind of oily.  While a little pricey I have decided to give them another shot as I hear they make a great burger. The next time I think I will try their location in Phoenix where hopefully it will not be as crowed.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,The best drive thru restaurant around.  Never get sick of coming here and the service is exceptional compared to other chain drive thrus.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,My first Chick Fil A ever. Really really good Chicken sandwiches. Chicken was really good; crisp outside; perfect inside. Bun was great too.  Fantastic service for a fast food joint like this. Friendly people all around.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,always fast friendly service & hot food!,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,Sooo I am downgrading this location to a  after my last visit. Don't get me wrong I love chick-fila but seriously my last visit here was my last visit to this location. I ordered the spicy chicken and ......surprise there was a giant and I am talking massive hair attached to the lettuce which was totally awesome! No more sandwhiches for me....seriously!,0
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,Very friendly service and the best breakfast burrito around.  This place gets pretty busy in the AM; but moves people through quickly.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,Service was FAST! Taste good too. Place was clean as well.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,Had some issues getting the order in a timely manner but the manager made it up with some free OJ.  Biscuits are fairly good here; especially relative to other fast food options.  Hash rounds come in the cute white boxes.  Convenient location right by the frontage road.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,"Boo for Chick-fil-A closing the Ghettrocenter location; which was closer; but yea for this location for being so much closer than Arrowhead.  Come to think of it; this location was quicker and more efficient than Arrowhead; resulting in hotter; fresher food.  Yea for Deer Valley Chick-fil-A. My lunch hour drive thru order was ready before I was with the cash; meaning the chicken's precooked; but they still had to slap it together; since I got the lettuce and tomato.  All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce; good-as-can-be-expected tomato (2 slices); and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum.  The two clerks I interacted with were friendly and it even seemed genuine.  Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices; but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have. (Exactly what part of the chicken is the 'patty'; anyway?)  Churchies own all their places; so they are oh so annoyingly closed on Sundays as a rule.  But the food is so good that any effort to protest them by not going the rest of the week would be short-lived.  Now if they ever started in-store proselytizing; that'd be a different story; but they've never done that; far as I can tell.  When I go in; I get the Ice Dream; exactly what part of the cow that is; I do not know; but it's sad to think they get those cows' hopes up by making them stooges for their \EAT MORE CHIKN\"" mock-protest marketing campaign; only to steal their dreams from them one way or another; and freeze them up for a tasty frozen dessert.  I picture a dark and gloomy torture room; probably the basement of one of their churches; where cows are strapped up and sucked of their dreams;  like the hapless folk from the Dark Crystal having their 'essence' drained by the Skeksies.  Or maybe that's how they get the fresh lemonade?""",1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,Best service in a while I feel like I'm in a 5star restaurant! And the only place that had said merry Christmas this year! Highly recommend,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,We love the family friendly atmosphere of Chik Fil A. The customer service is always professional and the employees know how to greet and treat their customers. They offer quality food at a fair price.  We are happy to give them our business.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,First time actually eating at a Chick-fil-A; and I am a fan! The customer service far excited 90% of the service you get at other fast food places.   There was a play area for the kids; which made everyone happy! The gilled chicken sandwich was tender and overall delicious. I am a little embarrassed that it took me so long to try this place. The only negative thing was that the kids chicken nuggets were kind of small; but that is probably because they are actually chicken unlike other places.  I look forward to eating here again.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,Staff is very friendly and the food is always good.  Our order wasn't right when we had already gotten home a couple of years ago and the manager sent us a $20 gift card as a sorry. They will have our business for life!,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,My first time ever eating at a Chick Fil A. Yum yum and yum.  Tried the chicken nuggets; the tortilla soup; the waffle fries and a chocolate shake. I was extremely full. No; I did not eat it all. I did sample each of it and the shake was THE BEST PART! The nuggets aren't your mcdonalds nuggets. These are real nuggets of meat; not a byproduct and its all in the sauce. The chick fil a sauce was my favorite. Fast friendly service and a very clean restaurant.,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,"I go here for lunch from time to time because it is close to work.   If you have little kids; you will love this Chick-Fil-A. If you don't; it will annoy the hell out of you. Guess which category I'm in?  It's like trying to order food inside of a daycare center. The little kids scream and run around continually with their balloons. I expected to start hearing some sing-song rhymes and jump-rope chants. This would be fine on its own; but the staff seem to cater to the kids at the expense of everyone else. Today the line was stopped so that a red balloon could be located. \She really wanted to have a red balloon; not a yellow one.\"" Too damn bad!  I can't complain about the food; it's consistently good. It's just a frickin' headache to get food here.""",1

It's a little pricey; but tastes great and is fresh.""",1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,"My friends make fun of me for loving this restaurant so much.  I realize that calling it a restaurant is a bit of a stretch; however; this location makes it easy to forget they are fast food.  Food: Most \fast food\"" places have a large variety of things to choose from.  Chick-fil-A keeps it simple. They have the best chicken sandwiches on the planet; and they must know it since it is 50% of their menu. I don't particularly like chicken sandwiches; but the ones they make are incredible. Don't forget the buffalo sauce.  Atmosphere and Staff: Inside is always clean; and the decor is comfy.  They keep the AC around 70-72 degrees and some might find it a bit chilly. The management seems to be doing a excellent job. The staff seems to enjoy their work; and even when the place is packed; I have never waited long for my order.   They even have a play area for the kids!  What could be better?:  They are closed on Sundays (I often forget).""",1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,I have been to at least 4 different Chick-fil-A's since i moved to Arizona and this location in Deer Valley is by far the best. First of all it is right across the street from where i work and they are always giving away free food...via your receipt or sending out discount coupons. They make the best chicken sandwich on earth...i am not kidding. It is the first real chicken breast sandwich i ever seen served at a fast food restaurant. It is a little more expensive than your average chicken sandwich but it is definitely worth it. It is not open on Sunday's because it is a Christian Franchise so they let their employee's have Sunday's off.   This particular location has great customer service...fast service...it is extremely clean and all the food is great no matter what you choose. The dessert is not half bad either...so if you ever want the best chicken sandwich you have ever had in your life please go to Chick-fil-A. Eat; Drink; and be Merry my friends!!!!,1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,"Chick-fil-A is always good; but this location is awesome. I'd like to do a study on their training program and corporate culture and this is the location where I'd start. \Oh; my pleasure!\"" See how many times you can hear that when making an order through the drive-thru.   Oh yeah; and the food is good too! I don't know what they do to the chicken breasts they make their sandwiches with; but man they are good! I'm addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich. Let's face it; nothing fried is \""healthy\"" but using fresh ingredients; peanut oil (cholesterol free and no trans fats) is a good start; and they do have truly healthy offerings if you want to go that route (sorry; no waffle cut fries on that menu!)""",1
ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,I really enjoy the food here. Probably one of the best layouts for a fast food but it feels more homey than any fast food. The service is very hands on; extremely well maintained facility; the best playroom ever and the food is great. If you watch your diet; the salads are great. I am willing to pay a higher price for food when the service and product is his good.,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,My first ever Five Guys experience was at this location. The staff was quick; friendly and efficient. They had customer service down to a science. the food was great and the drink stations never lacked in anything.   The only problem was with the seating...it was hard to move your chair and not accidentally bump into somebody else. But I think it was because I visited this place on a weekend.,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"Stopped in for a first visit to this Five Guys today; joined by Robyn N.  I went with a regular (large) Cheeseburger with their preselected \All the Way\"" toppings of mayonnaise; lettuce; tomato; grilled onions; mushrooms; pickles; ketchup & mustard; plus a \""Small\"" (not small) order of skin-on fries.  It was noisy in there; in typical Five Guys fashion; but the food was delicious & we had a good time.     :-))  Cheeseburger $6.59; Small Fries $2.49""",1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,If you're in the mood for a good cheeseburger this is the place to go! The menu super simple. There's lots of way to customize your cheeseburger with a whole bunch of different toppings.  On a side note make sure you only order a small burger if you want a single patty or regular burger for two patties.  Learned that the hard way. Two Patty is just too much meat. I do think they need to add Sriracha to their topping list. ;-),0
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"Love it!  2patty burger cut in 1/2 is enough for 2people!  I've heard comments like \its not flavorful meat\""----but; it's a TON of flavor! It's just all natural!  If u want GMO-burger-paste goto macdonalds.  Thank you 5guys...for good service; great burgers & fries!""",1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Five Guys you woo me with your delicious burgers and fries! The burgers are fat  juicy; flavorful and delicious! These burgers are old school Midwest diner type burgers.....Greasy the way a burger should be! I don't know what the problem is in AZ The burgers and Fries are excellent! The service at this location has always been fast and friendly.   These are awesome big ole greasy burgers! GO EAT ONE!  Side bar (Debbie S) Post your review once not on every location that you have never been too that is just plain RUDE!,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Lets start with the positives.  The staff here is super friendly.  Everyone behind the counter is in good spirits and looks to be enjoying their time as much as possible during work hours.  They also have free peanuts upon arrival; much to the like of the Teakwoods bar establishment in the valley.  Those would be the two positives encompassing the lack of just wiping the floor with Five Guys and giving them the one star rating.  I ordered the normal burger; which is actually two patties as opposed to the little burger which is just one patty.  I added the bacon; grilled mushrooms; grilled onions lettuce; tomato; and light mayo. I made sure to ask for light mayo; because there does not need to a gallon of it on my hamburger; like most places in town like to garner.  Of course I am going to try the french fries; so an order of those went on the bill to conclude.  After a short wait; I collected my order and proceeded to survey the land.   The hamburger is tasteless; there is no other way to say it. It is not good. Its not an opinion; this burger is just plain garbage.  Perhaps the staff could take the half gallon of salt they are putting on the fries and move a partial amount to the meat; because there is quite simply no seasoning and thus no taste. Ah yes; a nice treat; my light mayo was in fact slathered all over the top and bottom of the bun; always fun to take the mass napkins given to me to deconstruct the burger; wipe off superfluous mayo and return burger to original state. I took two bites and through the burger away; its just not good.  The fries are decent; I suppose. Maybe I was just really hungry from not eating the burger I had such high hopes to enjoy.  So much for Five Guys; total bust.  Note of review; the establishment does happen to have those cool tech soda machines that let you mix all sorts of different soft drinks together. I made a 50/50 coke zero lemon/lime mix.    Take my advice; avoid this place and make the trek to Zinburger; you will not be sorry.,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,I love me a good burger and 5 guys doesn't disappoint.  The burgers are ok for the price but the fries are a MUST order.  A regular order can feed 2-3 people because they don't skimp.  As a whole I would give this place 3 stars but they earned a 4th start for their online ordering system.  No waiting in line for this gal!,0
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Double bacon cheeseburger simply delicious. (Should have ordered the little one) The fries are the best I ever eaten. Hot; fresh; and perfectly salted. You can tell that the people working there enjoy what they are doing & that makes the food taste even better!,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Nearly 11 years ago or so; I was traveling through the midwest and there was a little hamburger joint in a run-down building that was near my hotel. Free peanuts and unlimited free toppings was unheard of back then and the burger and experience was memorable. A decade later; five guys just started popping up everywhere and it became famous; so I was back trying those burgers and fries again and hoping to recapture that grey day years ago in the midwest and have another great burger. I always like rooting for the little guy; but Five Guys is not little anymore; they have made it; so whether or not I root for them anymore doesn't matter a lick.    I ordered a Little Hamburger and fries and the meat is still fresh and the fries still have that skin on (although way oily) and the peanuts are still available. Stores all have that corporate look and feel; but these burgers are better than other fast food chains. It's not legendary; but not overpriced either at about 4 bucks for a 1/4 pound burger. Still; the best part of Five Guys is throwing your peanut shells anywhere and everywhere. Yep; it's the small things in life that make me happy.,0
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,I ordered the double cheese burger with pepper jack.service was slow for a fast food  the burger was nice and juicy with plenty if flavor.  The size of fries eas overflowing for a medium .definatelyvwill go back,0

XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,I'm so happy that this Five Guys opened here!  Five Guys is a great place to get a burger. The base is a delicious patty; spiced and cooked with good flavor; inside of a hamburger bun. From there; you can choose an array or toppings or none at all. Once you order; you wait until your number is called and you go get your food.  It can be pretty heavy; so it's not a frequent meal I partake it; but when I do I enjoy it very much so. The Cajun fry's are delicious. There is no reason to order anything other than a small. They give you a cup-full inside of the bag on top of your regular order.,0
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,I have been sick and was really craving a burger and fries.  I have been driving past the new Five Guys on 44th and today seemed like the perfect day to try.  The service was actually really good and the employees were very friendly.  Also; just a side note they have the really cool new Coke machines that allows you to mix flavor into your fountain drink as seen on Food Network.  The problem is the food.  We got 2 burgers; hot dog and fries.  The fries I thought were decent but over salted.  The hot dog was nothing special and the burger was a let down.  I was really expecting a in-n-out style burger and walked away with a smashburger experience.  All Hype no follow thru.  I was also shocked that a place that prides themselves on their burgers and relying on one product they don't ask how you would like it cooked.  Even when ordering a burger at Chile's I am asked how I would like it done  I have to say I was surprised; seeing as they are Zagat rated I was expecting a lot more.  The concept is fresh; clean and I like the peanuts you can munch on while you stand in line and wait for your order.  Just overall I think they need to improve the quality of their seasoning and style.,1

XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Excellent customer service from every staff member and clean. The burgers; of course; are amazing every time.,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,This location is perfect came in and waited for 25 minutes they accidentally forgot my order the management was very sincere about the mistake and recovered my order very well. I love this location friendly and real!,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"the customizable soda station gets 4 stars alone! But then I had my burger. Delish! The bun was toasted but also super soft which doesn't normally work but it was perfect!  I'm not normally a big fan of fries; could take them or leave them; but Five Guy's fries are sooooooo very good!!!!  I'd never heard of this place until the other day when I was in Phoenix with my boyfriend. He suggested it and so I said \what the heck\"". So glad I made that decision. Then I go on the website and find out they have locations in the Seattle area! This could be very good or very bad depending on how you look at it.  One suggestion; if your appetite isn't very large; go with the Little Burger. My boyfriend has been here before and warned me ahead of time. It was very good size on its own so I'm glad I didnt go with the regular one. They also give you tons of toppings options at no extra charge. All in all; can't say anything bad about this place. They even have peanuts you can munch on until your order is up.""",1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,I go to Five Guys all the time. I like the regular fries and my girl likes the cajun. We asked the cashier and they were very nice and let us know you can order some cajun seasoning on the side and apply it to your liking. Hope this works for you!  Five Guys is the best! I used to think In-N-Out Burger was the bees knees but my opinion changed as soon as I was introduced to Five Guys. Anyone who is unsure about a new chain in this area should really take a friend (or two) and try it. You won't regret it!,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,This place is great for when you want something fast but don't do fast food!  It had a 50's diner feel to it; really nice employees and fast service.  The fries are freaks cut and fried in peanut oil which I really like; and the burgers come in two sizes so you can get a smaller one if you don't want a monster burger... But they have those too!  They also have just about ever topping for a burger you could think of...  No drive thru; but it's worth it to run in and grab to go or stay and eat a minute.  The music is loud and sometimes a little annoying depending on what is playing;)...   Just say no to crap like mcdonalds and come here instead!,1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"This is an unfair review based on pricing and the menu.  More of a heads up.  I hear good things about this place; especially for a chain; so I decided to stop by for lunch.  Unfortunatly; I also decided to leave before I ordered.  Two reasons.  First is price.  A plain burger is $4.  With cheese and goodies you are running up towards $6; which doesn't include fries.  All in all you are looking at $10 - $12 for a \combo\"" meal which is something they don't offer.  I like to eat so I was looking for some sort of double but I didn't see one on the menu.  What I did see (second reason coming up...) is that they cook all meat WELL DONE.  If I'm going to spend that much for a burger and fries I would like to be able to order it how a burger should be cooked (which is meduim or medium rare if you didn't already know).  Recommend \""The Grind\"" or \""Delux\""; both a stones throw away; and both do burgers right.  For a burger and fries; either will run you about the same amount if you forgo the tea and get water.  Both are Local to boot.  There's my two cents.""",0
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"The concept behind Five Guys takes fast food to a new level. I call it \Premium Fast Food\"". After all; plan on paying about a 40% premium over the scarf and barf places that are on every corner. But there is a reason to pay more. Five Guys is labor-intensive. They employ actual people who are friendly; fun; dedicated and efficient. Where the Arcadia store finds these people is a mystery but I'm glad they do.   The menu is very simple. They sell burgers with one veggie and one cheese sandwich option and a hot dog. That's the menu. When they say \""Burgers and Fries\""; they mean it. Instead of a smashed mess with a quarter-inch thick piece of mystery meat in it; Five Guys delivers quality meat; hand formed patties; hand assembled while you watch and a real human touch with others lack. But I can eat and enjoy a Bacon Cheeseburger there and be stuffed; not wondering what is going to get me through the rest of the day. It's darn tasty; too and worth the drive out of my way.   Also; if you want to delve into the health aspect; this is much healthier fast food in terms of fat; calories from fat; sodium; etc. The customer is in charge of what goes on the burger; too. Want to cut the sodium; order without the bacon. Simple choices.   I also love the Coca-Cola machines which are self-serve. They offer a myriad of soft drinks you can't buy in stores like Lime Coke and Raspberry Coke. Mmmm.""",1
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Amazing Burgers... Bad Fries  I absolutely love the burgers here. Theyre very juicy; cooked just right and they have a wide aray of options for building your burger. Personally; I like putting the green chilli peppers on my burger. However; every time I order the overpriced fries her they always turn out soggy and greasy which is a big turn off for me. Although I often just order it to go and eat the burger at home with some chips or a side dish to complete the meal.   When you order you can expect to pay a pretty high price relative to other burger joints and the wait is longer than average.,0
XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,love this place! great food and great service!,1
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,Didn't end up eating here because the cashiers were sooooooo slow.   Brother and I stood in line for 10 minutes with two other people in front of us. They had simple orders but cashiers were too busy chatting it up amongst themselves. Guys cooking burgers also looked dirty; gave my brother the 'let's leave' glance and never looked back.,0
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,I come with my wife about 4 times a month; its our favorate place to eat hamburgers! Although; a little pricey; the service and food makes up for it! Came in today for lunch and they had a line out the door (like usual) and was served in a very timely manner. The staff was staying busy and the restraunt is always spot on clean. The manager put on a show by being all over the place; he was very fast and extremely helpful not only to his staff but everyone in the store. I recommend this place to everyone. They serve hot dogs and hamburgers with countless topping items! Also there fries are to die for; I always get the spicey cajun!,1
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,Worst berger ever. Got our order wrong twice  paid too much. Could have got two mcdoubles and had better food,0
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,good burgers and service but disappointed  in the cheese. everything else tastes so fresh and they even post which farm the potatoes come from. the processed cheese didn't fit and was gross.,0
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,This place is the BOMB! I could eat there everyday and not get tired of their food; the best burgers and fries ever.. Not alot of other choices than burgers but that's what Five Guys is all about!  The place was clean; the service was wonderful. I had the double burger with Cajun fries; they give you alot of the price and there are tons of different soda choices too you can be Sir Mix alot and make your own creation with your drink!,1
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,"\No. I don't want 5 guys. 5 guys are the guys who can't get no love from me. Servin' up some ok fries; but the price sky high.. ya won't hear no hollerin' from me!\""  Between the sloppy staff; the hard to swallow prices; and the OMITTANCE OF CHEESE; which made my bacon burger even HARDER to swallow; this Five Guys location gets a whopping 2 stars. That being said; I think I would have been happier with a Whopper. The only redemption to this meal; which was had on really ugly tables; and super uncomfortable seats; was the glut of french fries. I allegedly had a hot dog too; but it was obviously quite forgettable; because the only detail I really remember from the hot dog was explaining to the broad who took my order that \""everything on a hot dog *doesn't mean lettuce...\""  I'll go satisfy my appetite with something spectacular....... elsewhere.""",0
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,How in the world does this place not have at least 4 stars. I have yet to find a better tasting burger in the valley. Yes it's a little expensive $25 for two people; but it's great to go every once in a while. Every order is to-go. They give you a drink cup full of frys and drastically overflow your cup so that the whole bottom of the bag is basically frys. A little greasy; buy delicious if you like a little grease in your food. In-N-Out is walking distance from my house; but when I have a burger craving I always go to five guys.  Get Cajun seasoning on the frys Toppings are free Soooo many frys! :D Mmmm..  Go get a burger already!,0
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,Good burger today. Ordered a small burger with bacon and cheese plus the free condiments; like Frank's Hot Sauce and sliced jalapeños. My wife has gluten issues; so we ordered a lettuce wrap for her; with pickles; tomatoes and spreads.  They forgot her tomatoes. When you don't get much on your burger; you want want you order.   Fries are always good at 5 Guys.,0
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,I'm so happy to have a Five Guys near us now. This is located in the plaza near Target; Jimmy John's; and the old Costco (now becoming a Winco). It is a classic Five Guys setup with peanut bags and all.  When we went; it was crowded but service was efficient. We sat in the back and enjoyed the music and watching people use the fancy new Coke machines. The burgers and fries were delicious and we enjoyed it very much.,1
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,On our visit to Mesa we decided to try the Five Guys Burgers and Fries given it's popularity and cult followers. You can order a burger with a beer or wine. Even though it's freezing cold; people were getting their Five Guys Burgers and Fries and ice cream too. The crinkle cut fries are nice as a choice but nothing special. The real gems of this place are the burgers and hot dogs. Whatever that special sauce is on the burger; it makes all the difference. We ordered the smokestack burger and highly recommend it. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get into the restaurant but it was worth it. There isn't enough seating for all of the patrons so I would recommend you tag team it. Tell the person you are with what you want and start scouting for a place to sit. Ask someone who is almost done eating to motion to you when they are done. By the time you pr partner is through the line and the food is ready; you should have a spot to eat! Otherwise; take it to go and eat leisurely in your hotel. BTW; the greeter is an awesome guy and keeps the line moving. All the cashiers were smiling and helpful too. Four of us eating a burger a drink and only 2 fries came to $50. Definitely worth the visit to have a REAL meat burger!,1
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,I had read somewhere that Five Guys have the best burgers around so I was out doing errands and stopped by to get a takeout for lunch at the Power Rd.; Mesa store..  This was my first time in the restaurant.  What's with the huge bags of potatoes when you first walk in?? I turned right when I should have turned left trying to get to the counter around the bags and there were so many tables crammed in; it was hard to maneuver through.  I got a regular burger; which is really a double burger...should have got the small burger with one patty.  Okay; so it is a pretty large burger and they have a lot of free toppings.  It COULD be a great burger...but; they fold them too tightly in aluminum foil and the guy literally smashed the bun to a skinny mushy mess.  The fries could be really great too if they weren't so over salted.  I wouldn't mind ordering them again and asking for no salt.  After I got my order; I tried to get out of the place.  I wondered..should I go back through the order line against the wall that is all closed in with huge stacks of bags..no; couldn't do that because a long line had gathered...so again worked my way through the tables; everybody trying to move for me.,0
JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,"Went here for lunch today. Ordered two burgers and a large cajun fry to share. We waited for about 15mins for our food. Normally we would not have minded but we were the ONLY people in the place. When we got our food our fries were not cajun so we brought them back to the counter. The gentleman at the counter; larger guy with glasses; asked us if we want them remade; we said yes. Then he said; \Actually; here is some seasoning\"" He gave us one container of cajun seasoning. We said we would prefer them remade; it tastes great fresh and with the seasoning. At that point; he was ignoring us so we just went back to our table and began eating.   I'm not impressed with their lack of customer service. We ordered something; we should get it. I've had much better service at the location on Val Vista and Baseline at Dana Park. I would drive the extra miles to get great service and quality food.""",0

Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,If you don't like Dairy Queen; just stop reading now...     Are they gone now?   OK; for the rest of us; Culver's is a family-friendly fast food joint; and their Butter Burger is pretty good. As other reviewers have mentioned; the burger is not the same as In-N-Out; but I get sick of the same old burger. I like some variety; and this is a good-tasting; fairly high quality burger. It's a bit unique because they butter the inside of the bun and press the beef patty until you get a slightly toasty outer edge on your patty. As for the sides; the cheese curds are not that great (A&W has better); but the onion rings are good. I haven't tried their crinkle cut fries yet; but I hear they're pretty good. Eh; from now on; I will just get a single Butter Burger and a small custard; that's more than enough food for one person!  I will probably visit Culver's every month or two just to try something new from their large menu. The service is VERY good and VERY friendly; the restaurant is clean; and there is a nice LCD where they show sports games. However; you shouldn't bother coming to Culver's unless you like ice cream. The custard tastes a lot like soft-serve ice cream; but thicker and richer. The different flavors of custard mixes are fun; but avoid the brownie bits (eww!). On the other hand; the turtle mix was really good with all those nice roasted pecans.  Give Culver's a shot. Just skip the sides and save PLENTY of room for dessert,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,My family goes to Culver's about once every other month. I love the Butter Burgers and cheese curds (which I had never had prior to going my first time).  One time I did have the grilled chicken sandwich and I was very disappointed. It was dry and salty; not at all what I've come to expect from Culver's food. Every time we've gone the service has been great and everyone has been super friendly.,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,I've only ever been through the drive through; so as for service; I can't really say. As for the food; everything is at best; mediocre. The butterburgers are pretty awful in my opinion. They are extremely greasy; thin; overcooked; and have NO flavor at all. Even the toppings (Mushrooms etc) had no flavor. A little salt can go a long way! The mashed potatoes tasted like bad cardboard; and some of the other sides were pretty sad. The only good part of their food is the custard which is pretty good; as well as their shakes.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,When I first moved to Phoenix and then to the East Valley I was looking for new and different places to try.  I had never heard of Culver's.  I looked over their website and on one Saturday afternoon my daughter and I took a ride out this way.  We looked over the menu and I had one of their famous Butter Burgers.....Mushroom and Swiss; and my daughter had a grilled cheese.  The kids meals come with a one scoop sundae too; good deal.  Let me say that Butter Burgers are delicious!  I love them.  Their fries are good too but then I found cheese curds......OMG!  I am from California so I had never had these morsals of goodness before.  A Butter Burger; cheese curds and a root beer and I'm good.  But then the frozen custard.......YUM!!!  And a Concrete Mixer....wow!  And they run a special on pints to take home.  You can get 4 pints of custard for $8 and change!  Good deal!  They have a different flavor everyday.  Recently I had Pumpkin Pecan and it was delicious! The service is always fast and friendly.  I have never experienced anything but a smile here.  This location is about 10 miles from me and not far in the grand scheme of things.  I recently found out that they opened a new location closer to me!!  YAY!!  Forget those other fast food joints.  McDonald's pales in comparison.  Butter Burgers are fresh and soooo good.  And they have a variety of other choices.  They also offer fried chicken; fish and salads.  But note....this is NOT for someone on a diet.  This is where you splurge!  I love Culvers!!  Now if In and Out had frozen custard too I would be torn.,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Thank God people started opening Culver's franchises in AZ; I've missed them sorely since I left the Midwest.  The food won't make you any thinner but wow it is delicious for fast food.  Favorite order is the Double Deluxe Butterburger Basket.  Every location I've been to has very friendly staff and very clean eating and condiment areas.,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,this place is great. good burgers. good fries. good ice cream.  Need I say more?  Oh yeah; their service is unparalleled by any other burger joint.,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,The place looked good from the outside. Yet; as I ordered one of their burgers; I was disappointed. The beef patty was very thin and soggy. The fries were; in addition to sharing the sogginess of the burger; a tad cold. The place was packed though--so; it must have been one of those orders that did not hit the mark. I am not sure I would go back.,0

Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,So we've been hearing all sorts of buzz about Culver's.. the famous butter burger and frozen custard place from Wisconsin. So we piled in the car and headed out to Mesa. When we got there the place was packed.. we stood in line for 10 minutes before it was our turn. The service is very friendly and super helpful. We even ordered the flavor of the day; caramel cashew swirls and were told we could pick that up later so it didn't melt while we ate our dinner.. that was very cool!  Anyway; you place your order and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you when its ready.. another nice touch. Well after we got our food; butter burgers; fries and cheese curds we felt well; kind of let down. The burgers here are alright; kinda greasy and lacked a good beef flavor. The cheese curds were also deep fried (as most on the menu) and were good but not as good as I was hoping.   The crowd there.. it was like I was in Iowa or something.. definite Walmart crowd.. I sat there and watched this kid pick his nose and then proceed to fill his soda cup from the soft drink fountain.. uhm; yeah.. I just looked at my cup and thought about all the other people who touched that button.. suddenly didn't feel very good.   We got our frozen custards.. eh; very very smooth and creamy but to me just tasted like ordinary soft serve ice cream. Cashews were salty and nicely roasted; a good contrast to the smooth custard but lack depth and interest in the overall taste of the frozen custard.  I probably wouldn't ever go back here.. though the service is great and is priced well; I just don't think the food was worth the drive back out to Mesa.,1

Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Love the butterburgers and cheese curds here!! A must go for a good burger and very decently priced. Always made to order so you know its fresh. The bacon is cooked to perfection and makes a nice crunch. Just how I like it!! Had to sub the curds for the fries; but that's not a problem with a cheese loving kid like myself!!! Will be back for sure.,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,The custard is SO yummy!! I got the pecan sundae and it was delicious. I'm obsessed with cheese curds and theirs are OK; but not exceptional. Way too much breading. The service is always great at Culvers and the place is clean!,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,I LOVE Culvers! Their butter burgers and cheese curds are mouth-watering and I always order their creamy home-brewed root beer. And their custard is always wonderful. I am utterly addicted to this place.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Great food; friendly service; the frozen custard is great.  I definitely will be coming back here for my guilty pleasure cheat days!,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Change is coming to Arizona.  After years of being written off as a red state; a new challenger had emerged from the Midwest with the hope of turning us blue. In a challenging economy; the naysayers wonder if they will get very far. Others have ignored them as a bunch of hype; providing no hope to Arizonans and their diet. And by now; many Yelp Elite members have all but counted them out.  But the people at Culver's have a different idea.  They realized this race isn't about them or any other burger franchise in this state. It's about whether Arizona-at this defining moment-will continue down this same road of being dominated by Californian or Texas chains; or whether we will seize this opportunity to take the state down a different path--to forge a different culinary future for the dining scene we hold dear.  And yet; in spite of all the doubt and disappointment - or perhaps because of it - many have come to Culver's Mesa location out  in numbers that this country has never seen; and stood for change. It stands reassuring; a familiar in a strip mall laden with an uncertain future; physically incomplete and a harbinger of an age of economic insecurity. But wait in line or sit in the drive thru and you will see that everything is made to order. And for some this means you will have to wait; and wonder if your window of opportunity is passing you by. But then a friendly face walks up to you and hands you what you have been waiting for.  Culver's faces an opponent; In-N-Out; who arrived in California nearly eight years ago as a fast food hero; and earned an admirable reputation for a simple menu and independence from the franchise model.  Yet the one thing that In-N-Out doesn't represent is change.   Change is mixing ground sirloin and ground chuck into a single; uniform taste. Change is coating the bun in butter and then toasting it. Change is serving a burger where you taste this more than the sauce.  Change is offering different sides than just French fries. Change is allowing combos not just with salads or even mashed potatotes but Dairyland Cheese Curds. That is the legacy of earlier progressives like Bob LaFollete and Hiram Johnson.  Change is promoting your desserts just as much as your burgers. And change is being willing to eschew the safety of ice cream and the novelty of frozen yogurt for the consistency of custard.   That is what change is.   That is the choice this fall in Arizona.  The same question that first led us to Yelp a year ago months ago is the one that has brought us back here.  it is the one we will debate from Anthem to Maricopa; from the East Valley to the West Valley- the question of whether this state; at this moment; will keep doing what we've been doing; or whether we will take that different path. It is more of the same versus change. It is the past versus the future. It has been asked and answered by generations before us; and now it is our turn to choose.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,"You know if there is a frozen custard place anywhere in driving distance I will find it!  I'm tickled pink to find this one not far from my daughter's house in Mesa; AZ.  I even felt their quality was better than the ones's I had visited in the Mid-west and Texas; though maybe it was just cause I'd missed them.    Usually you won't catch me suggesting a fast food joint but we went here for lunch today.  I got the Pork Tenderloin sandwich which had a meat pattie way bigger than the bun it was on; perfectly breaded and fried with surprisingly fresh lettuce and tomato on it.  Daughter got a Deluxe Butter Burger with two patties and two slices of cheese.  It was good too.    She got a Reese's Peanut Butter \Concrete Mixer\"" drink for dessert; which I tasted and liked.  I got a Sundae with a scoop of vanilla frozen custard and Hot Fudge on top and it was so smooth and creamy; just like it should be.  I hope to get back there again before I leave but even if I don't at least I got my fix today! (4/19/09)  5/1/00 I couldn't resist stopping here on the way to my motel.  I decided to try the \""Walleye Basket\"" which was the daily special.  The fish was good and it was a thick piece and the breading was nice and crisp but it was very oily (10pm; end of the day) and the fish had a slight cod liver oil taste so I would probably not order it again.  The mashed potatoes were okay; about on a par with KFC; maybe a little better.  The Daily Flavor of Frozen Custard was M & M Mixins; which turned out to be a chocolate-vanilla mix with M & M mini's in it.  I would have liked it better without the candy.  The frozen custard was delicious as always.  They locked the doors and stopped letting people in before 10pm closing which I thought was not cool; especially after seeing two little boys be disappointed when they found out they couldn't get any frozen custard.  I guess the teenagers thought if they started closing before 10pm they could be out the door at 10.  That's not how the restaurant business works though.""",0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,SO GREASY. SO GOOD. I love eating at this place because I feel like every bite of their food is in direct sacrilege to vegetarians and vegans. It just feels so good to eat whatever I want and live my life without people telling me what's good for me and what isn't. Like every time someone orders a burger there; a vegan collapses from protein deficiency. It's so satisfying. Anyway no offense intended to real vegans and vegetarians; you can do whatever. Yo want just like I can; but you know the kind of people I'm talking about. Like people who do crossfit. Not sure if you know anyone who does crossfit? Don't worry; they'll tell you. God these butter burgers are so delicious; but they really make you feel like you need to take a nap. Or a coma. No satire intended I really do love these burgers. God Bless America.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,CUSTARD ONLY ! ! !  On my way home from work; I decided that I needed something cold and sweet . . . and so I decided to stop by Culvers for a custard.  Ordered the daily special . . . today's was Turtle Cheesecake (two scoops on a waffle cone) . . . OMG . . . it was out of this world.  Here was my dilema . . . I'm now finished . . . I'm still not quite half way home . . . do I go back for another . . . Home won . . . but I will be back.  There is only one problem with the Daily special custards . . . if they have a mix in them; like pieces of cheese cake; nuts; or fresh fruit . . . they are mosly on the top of the custard and not throughout . . . so when you get to the bottom of the cone; you ussually only have the base custard . . . still great . . . but sometimes you still want the extras.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Love this place! Visited it for the first time tonight. I ordered cheese curds and a pumpkin cheesecake custard via drive-thru. Woahhhh; heaven! Employees were nice as well. Definitely shouldn't visit too often because I can already feel my butt getting bigger.  Nice treat though :),1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,"Most people who know me know that I love food and live to eat! Most people who know me understand that I am slightly eccentric. Most people who know me know that I plan my trips around what and where I am going to eat. So; most people who know me should not be shocked to learn that I drove to Arizona for a hamburger. What Carrie D? You drove to another state just for a hamburger? Are you crazy?  Perhaps I am a bit crazy; but when I read about Culver's I absolutely had to try their burger and custard...so my partner-in-crime (Brian V.) and I booked a hotel; hopped in the Mini; and drove to Arizona. My BFF Forest W. just happens to live in AZ so we picked him up and headed to Culver's.  Once inside I went all \fan girl\"" and honestly I think I freaked out the employees at the counter. They seemed genuinely shocked that I drove from another state just to try their food. After they figured out I wasn't dangerous they described the menu items; took our order; and volunteered to take our picture in front of the menu. They were very cool and alot of fun!  We all had the Three Cheese Triple Butter Burger. Three smash burger patties with American; Swiss; and Cheddar Cheese. It was really good; but did not match the magic of Freddy's Steakburger or Steak & Shake. Definitely a solid 4 star burger though. My two companions shared the fried cheese curds and loved them; in fact Brian V. said he would go back to Culver's just to eat the cheese curds.   For desert we all had the Flavor of the Day Concrete Mixer which was something involving chocolate custard and snickers...decadent crazy deliciousness!   Thank you Culver's for not disappointing this slightly crazy burger fan. By the way; it would be awesome if you could open some stores in Southern California!!!""",1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,This is an amazing place.  I have not had a chocolate malt as good as this since I was a kid.  We had to wait a little longer than usual (or so they thought) and brought us a coupon for our next visit.  Then we went back and we wanted to switch the coupon for something else; but they couldn't do it.  So we order malts again; just one.  We had to wait again and one of the boys came out and said we made an extra by mistake; do you want it?  Duh of course.  So we got two for the price of one.  Most excellent.  LOVE this place.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,The way my Dad talked about this place I seriously expected them to give you free lapdances with each meal. He serviced them and said their kitchen was one of the cleanest fast food kitchens he'd ever seen and then went on to blab for hours about how their food couldn't compare to anything else and they were going to change the way Arizona sees fast food.  We came here as a family for dinner. The place was REALLY crowded and the line long. It's kind of hard to order because they make everything made to order (which is good I mean...yum fresh!) but that means you have to explain what you want in detail on every burger. When you're ordering for a family of five; that makes it kind of complicated. I thought their prices were a little high too but my dad insisted it was worth it.   The burgers were really good. I was a big fan. The fries were whatever; but my dad ordered fried cheese curds and those were really tasty. Everything came out pretty quick but we discovered that we had been charged for an extra meal. So we ended up taking home a meal we didn't order because the line was so long we didn't want to complain about it. My family ordered frozen custard but I'm lactose intolerant so I held out. They said it was great though.  I'd definitely come back here but not with my entire family. The ordering situation was just too intense and messy for me. If they're going to be as busy as they are; they should really have a better system.,0

Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,I expected much more from this place.  I had heard exciting tales of succulent burgers cooked in yummy butter; and while I could definitely taste the butter; the rest was bland and poorly balanced.  Fries were ok; but they felt like a cheap Del Taco knock-off.  Service?  If you like a snotty heavy-set woman getting short with you; then it's great.  Culver's needs to hire some better folks; especially if they're trying to get their foot in the door here in Arizona.  They need employees who can think.  I had a coupon for a buy one get one free Double Deluxe; and they wouldn't substitute a cheaper burger for the free one.  Logic doesn't fly here; apparently.  Oh; and whoever designed the parking lot is an idiot.  What a horrible; cramped design.  If you drive a big truck or SUV; good luck to you.  I won't go back.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Been here twice. Service/ food delivery is fast. I always like how my burger is cooked. First time I had bacon cheeseburger; loved their fries. Second time I had kids meal cheeseburger and a separate order of cheese curds - they were pretty good. It almost beat Smash Burger ( my next fave burger place )... I also like their VIP card where in you get a free meal on your 8th visit. And having me and my husband ordered two different meals (one receipt) ; they still stamped the card twice. Only gave 4 stars having no Culver's close to our house. Overall; worth the try!,1

Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Hadn't been to Culver's in a couple of years; since I changed jobs and don't get out this way anymore. Nice to see they haven't changed. Frequented by seniors because it's a Midwest fave and for the good prices.   Ordered the bacon cheddar butter burger (single) with curds and a drink for under $8. Lunch arrived in 6 minutes flat-nice. Burger was hot; juicy and choice of standard toppings: mayo; mustard; onions; lettuce; tomato; etc.   Bacon was crisp too; just perfect. Cheese was thick cut with a slight melt. The cheese curds are not what you'd expect on your first visit. They bread them and fry them to perfection. Nice little cheesy nuggets of flavor.   The service at Culver's is always tops. Greeted properly at the door but not with the robotic 'welcome' you get at fast food. As the food is delivered to your table; the server always asks if there is anything else they can get for you. I was offered a custard sample at my table as well.   Culver's is a go-to for quality; service and price.,1

Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,I heard some ad on TV a month or so ago and wanted to try it out. Glad we did. Much better than many other FF places. The burgers are great and wife's chicken strips fantastic; crunchy coating and juicy chicken inside. My burger ; a double with bacon; very tasty with all the right compliments. I will now search out these stores  in the future when near them  for lunch or dinner. Oh and the service was great too as the young people who brought the food out were outstanding in manners.,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,I was at my son's basketball tournament and I have a complaining teenager about being hungry. Found the closest place I could. I've always wanted to try Culver's burgers cause I've heard people talk about it.   Anyways; order a single butter burger (doesn't sound too healthy) with cheese and fries. My daughter gobbled it up in less than a minute. I though the burger was pretty good. Juicy and fresh. Not bad. The fries were very crispy. Now I have another option when I have a burger craving.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,A few years ago I discovered Culver's while visiting my sisters in Austin. I fell in love. When I learned they were building one within a 10 minute drive from my house; well; I can't describe the feeling. It's actually a good thing that they aren't closer or I'd probably weigh about 20 more pounds than I do.  Anyway; Culver's has perfected the hamburger. Who else but a midwestern fast food chain would come up with the concept to dredge their hamburgers in butter before cooking them? They aren't those frozen uniform-sized patties either. My personal fave is the Swiss Mushroom variety but they have lots of other options as well. I hear the salads are good too - I just like the burgers too much to order anything different.  And their frozen custard is truly food of the gods. If you've never had frozen custard; you are in for a treat. It's like ice cream; but even more creamy with a slightly firmer texture. I tend to lean towards the turtle sundae which is assembled to perfection - vanilla custard topped with caramel; fudge and pecans.  They also have some very creative flavors of the day; including cheri amour amaretto; turtle cheesecake; bananas foster; caramel cashew; chocolate covered strawberry; apple pie... the list goes on and on.  The best part is that the prices aren't but a tad higher than you'd pay a McDonald's. Our family of 4 (which includes 2 teenage boys) can usually dine there for about $30 including dessert.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,The only thing bad I have to say about this place is that it is a bit pricey if you're not alone. Other than that the food is tasty; service is excellent; and it is hands down the best place to do a fundraiser. I love supporting my local teams and schools by eating here. They always have some sort of promotion going on. Its casual; but still nice. Its kept very clean. The menu has a nice selection and the food is always served hot. If you're looking for something fast that is more upscale than McDonald's; go here.,1
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Good food Horrible service!!!!!!!!  They need to have an intervention with a Dr. of Customer Service.  Management please step it up; help your staff be considerate and respectful.    No matter how good the food is if I receive horrible service more than once; you get one star.,0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,"My husband and I took my 2 teen sisters here a couple weeks ago & maybe my expectations were too high after reading all the great reviews; but I thought this place was seriously over-rated.   The food and service were just average; comparable to most other burger joints. We got burgers; chicken tenders; and onion rings. I prefer the onion rings at Sonic to Culver's. We also got the \concrete mixers\"" for dessert and again; very average. I will say I was impressed by the nice women's restroom :D""",0
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,For a fast food burger; this place is TOPS! Far superior to In'n'Out; which seems to be what a lot of people choose to compare it with. I guess it's like the whole Coke vs. Pepsi thing; except with burgers. And my choice is obvious. Tons of choices for toppings and condiments; fries are crinkle-style and tasty; and the selection of deserts is almost too much! Fresh food; friendly service; clean dining room and restrooms. Food takes a little longer than say; McDonald's; but it's well worth the extra minute. Give it a try; I think you'll be impressed.,1
pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,been there over a 100 times never had bad food or service. Great place for lunch.,1
pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,My husband and I tried this place on a whim. For a Saturday night this place was hauntingly empty. We were seated right away and our server promptly took our drink orders. The prices for sushi are on the high side but I ordered a roll and two pieces of nigiri anyways. My husband ordered the garlic shrimp noodles.   We listened to a decent cover band while we waited for our food. But like I mentioned the place was empty so I felt kind of bad for them. When our food came we were less then impressed. For the price I expected much larger rolls and a better cut of salmon. My husbands dish was bland tasting and made even worse by the old hot sauce sitting on the table he used to add a kick to it.   The gist of the evening is we had semi ok service (we did wait forever for the bill) and really not ok food. We will probably not be back.,0

pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,Our meal was delicious; the service was good and it was neat to be able to sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare everything!,1
pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,Worst service. I went when I was pregnant and unable to eat raw fish. The server didn't even know what she was bringing out. I asked her if she could ask someone and she just walked away. The manager was aware of the situation and didn't even care. I had to pay for a meal I didn't even eat; although I was extremely hungry. I will never eat here again.,0
pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,"Oh the Asian Kitchen is amazing. The menu is divided into different Asian Countries but the best thing on the menu has got to be the Ancient House Special Fried Rice. It is just divine- not greasy or heavy at all. They wok fry the rice with egg; shrimp; and chicken. If it's your first time coming here I implore you to try this and you'll be coming back for more like the Drunken Shrimp and Chicken which has a great spicy peanut sauce.   The killer entrees come in huge portions; I normally have to take half of it home and enjoy later.  They also have a good sushi menu and a great sushi chef who is personable and pretty darn fast. My favorite sushi on the menu is the \It's Always Sunny in AZ\"" and the \""Big Buddha Roll\"". The service is always great; the happy hour rocks; and they have live music on Friday nights. I can't believe this little gem is located in Mesa; but it's definitely worth the drive.""",1
pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,This is a small restaurant with max seating of 45.  The ambiance is intimate with subdued lighting and close seating.  The service is usually prompt and willing to answer questions.  The food is delicious!  With sushi and main entrees hailing from several Asian countries; this place has plenty of options.  My favorite dish here is Green Fuel; but have not had a dish here that I didn't like.,1
pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,Excellent food. Got crab puffs (tasted like east coast style); spider roll; and drunken shrimp. Was more than enough for my husband and I. We didn't get any beer but they had an excellent craft selection. Fair price and great food with good service.,1
pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,John and his crew are awesome! I have never had a bad experience; although at times lunch can be packed and service a tad slow; relax... The food and drinks are worth it. When you have food made to order and have it be how you want it; sometimes it can't be rushed. I can say; in my numerous times at AK; I have never been let down.keep it rockin John!,1

LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,Visiting the new Fiesta Mall In N Out Burger in Mesa a few times and despising the food; especially the soggy nasty fries; I tried this one in AJ to give it a chance. It was lunch time and just packed as these places get. Oddly enough with inside packed; line outside the door and people eating outside; we got in the long drive through line and I don't think we spent too much longer than five minutes. The fries were awesome and crispy and FRESH and a pretty good burger and nice fattening chocolate shake. Great; fast service and the food was GOOD! I think I'll go back some day!,0
LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,I love this place; it's convenient; good tasting; and cheap compared to other fast food establishments in the area.   Fries are sliced right there; using whole potatoes!  Burgers are cooked to order.  I love the SPREAD and always ask for extra packets for my dipping sauce for the fries. It's a taste of mayo; ketchup; and relish - YUM!  Waiting is my biggest complaint; but what can you do?  The best thing is if you haven't been or don't know - check out there SECRET menu online! Too die for!,1
LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,"My non yelp daughter (who I still need to get on board with becoming an avid yelper) and I go here all the time. We really love their fries. The burgers are probably my favorite for fast food. The service is always really fast and the food is hot and fresh. I hear there are \off menu\"" items that I am just starting to learn about which is fun. Prices are great. Only complaint is the parking lot was very poorly designed. Going through the drive through is a nightmare at times. I will say though; I was impressed that one time when there was a really long line then had someone outsite taking additional orders to get them going faster. That is really great service especially in this AZ heat!""",1

LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,Love In-N-Out for what it is. It has made fast food even faster by simplifying its menu and streamlining service. It's always packed with people but you still get your food fast. Plus I really love the fact that there packaging and cups have scripture printed on them.,1
LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,"The best burger joint I have ever had! Travel a lot; been to many burger places that claim they have the \greatest!\"" In and out burger can claim this; hands down!  The sauce on the burger; is unique and tasty; making this place original!  Smart thinking; placing an order taking outside; making the wait time less!""",1
LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,I don't get this place. The burgers are super greasy with no flavor even if you order them animal style   the fries were horrible. And we couldn't all sit at the same table. This was my second visit needless to say I wont be going back. I just dont get the hype go to Carl's Jr much better food,0
LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,This is one of the newer In and Out Burger locations and it sits on the corner of a big retail area near the county line. Overall; there is really no way to go wrong with In and Out. Every one of the locations offers the same thing.  The value is great which makes it popular with snowbirds. Five bucks for a single cheeseburger value meal is cheaper and better than McDonalds.  The place is crowded and every time I've been there service has been slow. But for me it is not really an inconvenience. People generally order a lot of food when they go there; like for an entire family; so the orders are large.   The bathrooms are extremely clean and from what I can tell the whole place is. Usually I eat outside under the umbrellas. Great place; great burger; definitely better than Five Guys.,0

LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,I love In-n-Out and I visit one every chance I get (living in Denver; this is not terribly often). This is a large; extremely busy; and clean location. Great customer service and as usual delicious burgers. Thumbs up!,1
LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,A new branch; this one with outdoor seating and umbrellas. Pitting the Best of the West vs. Best of the East; I ordered the standard two burger In-N-Outer plus a slice of onion; planning to do the same when I got back to the newly opened 5 Guys Burger on Long Island.  The In-N-Out burger overall was good; the lettuce and onion adding crispness; but the burgers themselves were thin; overcooked discs. However; the sauce was so addictive that my brother had to restrain me from going back and ordering another.  Sorry; West (see my review of the 5 Guys in Huntington Station; N.Y.); the East Coast burgers are plumper; juicer; tastier; and cooked medium; as a burger should be. One more star for the East.,0
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"Visited Potbelly on a Saturday around 12:30PM. Skip to the last paragraph for the short and sweet review.  I've seen this place a few times and finally had a good opportunity to stop in and grab a to-go order.  I like the name and figured it would be average (worst case); but hopefully I would be surprised. This location shares a building space with Starbucks.   Although parking is a bit limited I found a space straight away. I found the decor warm and inviting.  It smelled of toasted bread; a plus in my opinion. After a short wait for two people ahead of me a very pleasant and friendly person; Ann I believe; took my order. I ordered a tuna salad sub on multigrain bread as well as one of their signature sandwiches called \A Wreck\"" on their white bread.   I also substituted cheddar cheese on the wreck and no cheese on the tuna salad.  They toast their sandwiches; so into the toaster they went.  When they come out the other side you can ask to add your choice of condiments. I asked for lettuce; tomato and onion on both; with some Italian seasoning on the Wreck.  I added some Zipps kettle chips (delicious chips made in Louisiana) and a sugar cookie. My bill came to a total of $13 and change.  Most of the sandwich options are around $5. I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Arriving home I tried half of each sandwich along with the BBQ Zipps chips and found everything to be pretty good.  The bread toasted up nicely; leaving a crusty exterior.  Based on the price; I felt the sub had adequate amounts of ingredients.  There were options on the menu for extra meat and the like.  The sandwiches themselves were around 7 inches.  Although it was not mind blowing or life altering...I mean; it's a sandwich shop for Pete's sake!  The place was nice; clean and had a pleasant and friendly staff.  Service was quick and efficient.  The food was good.  Would I go back again? Yes.""",1

tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"My friend recommended this place to me and hyped it up a great deal; so I was super excited to come here! I decided to order the \special\"" as in what they recommend I try. In this case; I got \""The Wreck\"". How they made the sandwich was simple and clean; toasting the bread for a solid minute or so. After that they build the sandwich in front of you; it was well presented and made. Now onto the big part: The taste.  The sandwich itself was good; with the main ingredients being Salami; Roast Beef; Turkey; Ham; & Swiss Cheese. It was clean to eat and was warm due to coming straight out of the oven.  The main reason why i'm giving this place 3 stars is due to the simplicity and lack of ingredients. While the ingredients were good; it felt like I was eating meat on bread with melted cheese; not a well crafted and thought out sandwich with a multitude of complex and intricate flavors.  Overall; this place is much better than Quiznos; Subway; or Jimmy Johns. I plan on stopping by occasionally; but it won't be my go to place.""",0
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"This was my first time to ever go to pot belly. The sandwich I ordered was \a wreck\"". The employees there are very nice and made ordering a breeze! The toppings I got were pickles; which are not sliced like they usually  are but sliced long and thin (which I think is better cause now I get some pickle in every bite); mayo; and lettuce. The sandwich tasted great and I'm glad we now have a toasted sandwich shop near the ASU area.""",1

tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"Potbelly sandwiches; what a hype machine! After months of hearing about their \amazing\"" subs that supposedly make customers \""salivate\"" at the mere thought of eating one its easy to say I was quite intrigued and excited to see that the location nearby my apartment had finally opened. Deciding to stop in for a quick bite before work; I was immediately hit with a good vibe. Decor is well done here. Everything fits the sandwich stop demeanor quite well. Simple menu. Simpler ordering. What could go wrong?  Needless to say things were going well at the start of my experience. It's obvious the store just opened though as the massive crowd of employees; probably being trained; were doing jobs meant for a team half the size. Not a bad thing per say; just an observation.   I decided on getting \""The Wreck;\"" a sandwich with salami; roast beef; turkey; ham; and Swiss. An interesting ensemble of deli meats but sonically appetizing nonetheless. Whole grain bread; mayo; hot peppers; lettuce; onions; and tomato are My usual toppings and as such I had all of them put on the sandwich. I really appreciate them being upfront about caloric values of each item of the menu as well.   Service was incredibly smooth. Probably the greatest part of my first Potbelly  experience and I definitely hand it to the management for getting a team that large to function cohesively. Also putting the potato salad in front of the cash register was a clever way to get suckers like me to add one to the order... God knows i couldn't resist.  Unfortunately; I wish I could say the food impressed me nearly as much as the service. First and foremost is the lackluster bread. While I appreciate the bread avoiding the oddly popular \""air bread\"" motif places like subway serve; the taste just was not there. Dry; flaky; and dull. Not my cup of tea. The quantity of meat is average for a sandwich shop of this type. Just enough was placed on to assure myself that I wasn't being blatantly ripped off. I just wish the quality of the meat was any good. Before delving in; I pulled one piece of each meat to taste individually from the sandwich itself. Not much to say about it except that if I wanted Hillshire Farms caliber meat I'd make the sandwich myself. Strike two. The lettuce I received was reaching expiration as well. Many of the strands of lettuce had slightly brown edges and my god was there an immense amount of it. Without going into too much more detail I think it's safe to say the sandwich itself was really nothing to write home about. Incredibly average and sometimes subpar components? No thanks. Luckily my potato salad was tasty; but who cares? I came here for the sandwich.   Probably wont be returning here. Potbelly gets three stars only decor and great service. The food however needs some work and since its a chain; I highly doubt the change will ever come. Thankfully I only spent about $7...""",0

tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,Midwest gem finally comes to Arizona!  You can't go wrong with anything in their menu; but you have to try the hot peppers on the side.  They are fresh made and delicious as hell!  Plus you can buy a big jar of it if ya want.  I've tried a few different soups and they are all fresh; hot and delicious.  The broccoli and cheese is among the best I've tried.  I am addicted to THE WRECK; so good.  Meat is generous portions; fresh; and seasoned well.  Get bacon.  Extra bacon if you can.  It's really good here.  The Italian is also near perfection.  Load up on veggies here!.. Nice and fresh and tasty!  Nice ambience; plenty of seating options (tall tables; inside/outside; etc); and good customer service.  This is one of my favorite lunch spots.  TIP Get there at 1130 or earlier to beat the weekday lunch rush.  BACON!!!!!  MORE BACON!!!!!,1
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,Super good!  Great sandwiches; friendly and helpful staff; and fast service without skimping on quality.  Also; very reasonably priced.  I will be going back to this sandwich place.,1
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,This is my second time visiting Potbelly. Both times I've great service and delicious sandwiches. I like that they toast their subs. Can't wait to go back!,1
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,Let's be clear; I have been going to the original location on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago since the early 90's.  I just ordered the roast beef; extra meat; with everything; no hot peppers and also extra mayo and mustard.  BBQ chips with a root beer.  It was made just how I remember it from years ago.  Just terrific!  Of course; I finished with an Oreo milk shake.  Great finish.  I cannot wait for Potbelly to open on the west side...,0
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,This Potbelly location was clean; the service was great; and parking was tight. The sandwiches were OK - nothing spectacular. I think Quiznos is better. The prices were average - about $8.00 with tax for a sandwich and chips. Be sure to ask for mayo; mustard or oil; otherwise the sandwich will be dry.,1
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,A step above Jimmy Johns and 2x as good as Subway  The Wreck with everything is my Go-To order but their other options like the Pizza Sub is pretty decent as well.  Only wish is that they were a bit cheaper or offered a bigger portion,0
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,I stopped into Potbelly on a Saturday afternoon. The store is clean and the staff was friendly. They gave me a quick run down of the process since I had never been in before. I ordered a turkey sandwich and got mini cookies as well.  The process and the sandwich itself reminded me of Quiznos. They send it through the toaster and then you have your choice of cold toppings. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the bread was good too - nice crusty French bread.  Overall the sandwich was good but not a real knockout per se. Maybe I was expecting more since I had heard people raving about this place. If you like toasted subs; you'll like it. Would I go back? Sure. Would I go out of my way to go back? Not likely; especially if there was a Jimmy Johns closer.,1
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,Tried the new location on rural and broadway. Service was fast and friendly. Ordered the roast beef and the Mediterranean chicken. Both were really good. Will definitely be going back again to try more.,1

tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,My 1st time to this new location. I'm a big fan of the Chicago locations; especially at Midway.  I tried their newer chicken cheddar w/ bacon and didn't care for it. The chicken tastes processed. I have a turkey to take home and try though!  I'll come back for the quick service and to give them a second shot.,1
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,I'm partial to Potbelly because it was the first meal I had in my new place after a full weekend of hauling boxes and furniture. I guess you can say it holds a special place in my heart and it doesn't hurt that it's a five minute drive from my place.   I've only had one thing here; the roast beef sandwich. As far as roast beef goes; theirs is solid-flavorful; never dry and it's one of their lower calorie options if you're into that.   I like Potbelly because it's simple-sometimes I don't want to choose from 8 different types of bread and you'll never have to do that here. Their toppings are simple too-lettuce; tomato; hot/sweet peppers; onions; mustard; etc.; but when the quality is there; things don't need to be complicated.   I take off one star for the wait time. While the service is friendly; the wait for one sandwich; even when I take into account the toasting process; is just too long for me.  If you're looking for a good quality sandwich and don't want to make 50 different decisions to do it; Potbelly is your place!,1
tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"Potbelly's are popping up more and more around the valley so I was destined to stop into one eventually  Today was the day! The girls that work at this location are all so very nice and helpful  The decor is cute and very historical; a ton of it consists of ASU/Tempe/Phoenix information and landmarks... Fun to read or look and eat...  The signs make it easy to navigate where to start your order and so forth... The huge menu on the wall is very clear and thorough... The sandwich options are pretty extensive  Today I went for \The Wreck\"" and I dressed it with pretty much every topping except mustard... It consisted of Ham; Roast Beef; Salami; Turkey; and Swiss cheese! Also the sandwich was toasted; not sure if that is how each one is prepared but it was good and I didn't mind :) I had my sanny with jalapeño chips and it was a very good lunch... Glad I stopped in and I will return I agree with everyone in saying that it is a better sandwich option compared to subway and Jimmy johns... Decent price too""",1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I have not had In-N-Out for a long time. I never understood the hype. But I decided it was time to give it another try to remind myself why I wasn't crazy about it. I don't like the standard toppings on their burgers; so I got a plain cheeseburger. I never cared much for their fries so I just split an order with my friend. The fries were so oily that I could not have eaten more than half without feeling sick to my stomach. And I like grease! There is just something about them that doesn't jive with me. The burger was okay; but I would rather go somewhere that I actually like the fries (Five Guys; Culver's; Smashburger; Freddy's; even Wendy's). Sorry In-N-Out fans! I just don't get it.,0
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I have never had a bad order here; they work super fast and are always very friendly. I usually use the drive thru cause I'm lazy and don't want to get out of my car; the drive thru line is usually long but no worries!! They work fast! :),1

I placed my usual order of a Double Double with no tomato; both kinds of onions; and an order of fries.  Had a water to drink.  A little over $5.50.  Service was friendly but the food was \off\"".  My burger was not piping hot....the patties were warm but not hot.  The spread was also \""off\"".  I could taste a huge hint of mayo in the spread.  I know its made with mayo but they usually blend/cut that shit so well with the ketchup and relish; you never even get a hint of mayo taste.  I had more than a few bites with straight mayo taste.  It was not good at all.  The produce seemed a little off too.  The onions had a weird \""bite\"" to them.  Besides the Goleta In N Out; this was the worst In N Out Burger that I have had.  The fries were pretty good as usual.  Nothing wrong there.  I'm pretty sure I will not come back to this particular one.

eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,In-N-Out is standard. We went at lunch time and it was crowded (which is typical for all In-N-Outs). I was a bit suprised that my food was out right after I ordered (accidentally almost grabbed someone else's; they called 74 and I thought I heard 94). Anyways; the maximum capacity for the dining area is 71 people; so if your planning on having a party; bring under 71 otherwise your 72nd friend will have to sit outside (and no one likes to sit by themselves).  Pro's: 1. This In-N-Out is in a really good location. Right off the freeway; you can go off the freeway; grab your food; and go back on.  Con's: 1. Good luck finding a seat.,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,While this wasn't my first In-n-Out experience; it was my first in a over a decade and I have to say; I remember it a lot better than it actually is.  OK; don't get worked up. It just didn't thrill me.  It was fresh; well made and just fine.  I just don't want to build a temple in the building and worship it like others seem to!    I got a double double with onion (and when they mean with onion; they mean it!); fries and a chocolate shake.  I liked the burger (could have done without the special sauce; which to me is just thousand island); liked the fries; although they needed more salt and loved the shake (perfect consistency and chocolatey taste).   The place was packed; the service was fine and the price was right!  I would go go back; but I like Five Guys better - sorry I do!!,0
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,"All my life I've heard that in-n-out is the end all be all of hamburger joints. That there's no way I could any further in my life without visiting one. Every time I go to Vegas I hear \You HAVE to go to In-N-Out\"".   Well we were going to Goodyear Park and wanted to stop here since they were nearby. I'll give it to them; they were packed at 11am on a Saturday.  But I wasn't impressed. The burger and fries were just \""okay\"". Nothing to write home about or that I'd have to tell the world about (which I guess I'm doing right now). I know 5 Guys came after In-N-Out; but I felt like 5 Guys just does it better. You can actually order TOPPINGS. Crazy; I know.  All in all; I'd try them again; but don't know that I'd go out of my way for it.""",0
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,We've been coming here for years.  I've always loved In-N-Out ... the burgers are on the small end but it's perfect for me.  Great service.  Great food.  Super busy location.,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,My absolute favorite place to grab a fast food burger! Even when the place is super packed the staff is polite and make sure your order is correct. Finding a seat can be a huge pain at time but then that is what will happen at the best burger joint around right!,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Service is good but they are always busy.,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Absolutely one of the best fast food restaurants ever!!! Never had a bad meal here and always friendly staff. Be sure to look of the secret codes to order as they will make much more than what is on there general menu. Recommend the Double-Double with animal style fries and a drink. I hope one day they put one in Seattle; WA.,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Always fresh and good. Usually fairly busy; but service is quick and friendly...,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Nothing special; IMO. I visited to experience something new; as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok; not bad or the best tasting burger. The fries were fresh and not too salty; they tasted like potato chips. The restaurant was busy; but the service was prompt.  This was worth trying once.,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I have been to In-N-Outs in Cali and in AZ.  My niece from OH was craving it; so we all jump into the car and went.  I ordered the #2 (cheeseburger; fries; and a drink).  They still do not impress me; the cheeseburger was ok.  I love the fries but they have to be eaten fresh.  They taste soggy if you wait too long.   Smash Burger is still my love; sorry In-N-Out.,0
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I had never visited an In & Out Burger restaurant and wanted to know what all the hype was about.  So last night; my husband and I decided to try it.  My impression was it is a very clean restaurant with a whole lot of employees who seem to be incapable of performing their job easily or well.  There were so many people behind that counter; most of them just walking around or partnering with another employee.  It was almost overwhelming to see so many workers crammed into that kitchen.    The burger itself was okay; nothing special IMO.  I thought the bun was nice.  I asked for the burger itself to be cooked well; no pink.  Well; it wasn't.  It arrived medium well.  The special requests I made were followed except for the cooking temperature.  No fast food burger should be served pink unless requested.  Blech.  The fries that I have heard folks rave about were just awful for me.  Mine were served room temperature; barely warm.  Greasy; flavorless; and soggy.  Yuk and double yuk.    My granddaughter ordered a strawberry shake.  Something happened to the shake machine and they had a terrible time making that little cup of ice cream and milk for her.  When it was finally served; there was way too much strawberry sauce in the drink.  It was horrid.    I won't go back again because the food was not impressive and neither was the service; despite the many many people working.  The prices were very fair.,0

eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Always busy when it's lunch or dinner time!  It's worth it for their delicious burgers.  It's always the same at In-N-Out; juicy patties; fresh veggies and full fat cheese.  I usually order the Grilled Cheese; since you get all the juicy meat flavor without the meat.  Otherwise it's a double-double animal style with No Pickles and 2 sides of spread.,0
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,How could you not love to eat here.. Freshly cooked when you order. No confusing menu; none of that gibberish menu here; just your simple burger; fry; shake and a drink and num num num.  :),0
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,"I'd say this place is just a normal In-N-Out Business. You get the same treatment; the long lines; similar food quality and burgers; and the overall satisfaction of getting something in your belly after a long drive.  My friends and I stopped by this place on our way from Tucson; AZ to Los Angeles; CA and she was craving \animal style\"" fries so we had to stop by here.  If you do decide to make a pit stop at this place; I'll warn you now about the parking. The flow of traffic in and out from this restaurant business is awful. Lines build up and just finding parking in their small lot is a nightmare. We came around peak hours; unfortunately; and luckily found a spot in the corner to walk inside and order. I believe we got there around 12:30pm or 1:00pm and I never wanted to get out of an In-N-Out so badly until then. Haha.  But I digress. If you want a standard burger and fries that'll curb your appetite; this place is always the place to go to. It's conveniently located next to other shops and stores (like Taco Bell and Walmart); and is just off the freeway. How convenient!""",0
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I've literally never had a bad; nay; even mediocre experience here. Food is fresh; hot; out fast and so tasty. Service is perfect. Great value. My fav is #2 cheeseburger; protein style; ketchup and mustard instead of spread; and grilled onions :),1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Fast service; good burgers; same as any other in-n-out. The know how to handle lunch time with out making people wait too long.,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Man; I so miss this burger chain living on the east coast.  I've only eaten at one In-N-Out Burger place that was slightly sub-par; and this wasn't it.  Service like at a Chik-fil-a: We were about to sit down and a guy came running over to wipe down the table and seats.  They actually brought us our food.  And the place was packed; so the employees had to be on their toes to do this across the restaurant.  And the food?  The fries are really good; but I miss the burgers so much that I eschew the fries and double down on the double double instead.  If there is a better fast food burger experience; I'm waiting to have it.,1
eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,Good burgers and french fries as always!  Don't forget the In-N-Out sauce for your french fries.  We ordered one meal set for cheese burger; another cheese burger and a milkshake.  All that for only $10 :0 Seating could be tough but good service.,1

m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"This is the place to go in Scottsdale for an Italian beef.  When I visit Chicago I usually go to Al's or Portillo's for Italian beef and having Al's here saves me the trip to the Windy City.  The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  It's neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service.  I ordered the regular Al's beef with sweet peppers.  I usually don't order my sandwiches \wet\"" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.

m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I had a late lunch at Al's today. Ordered the italian sausage with red sauce and a large drink. I got a funny look because they didn't know what red sauce was. For the uninitiated; red sauce is mariana sauce in Chicago; I improvised and had them put mustard and grilled onions on my sausage samich (sandwich is pronounced samich in some parts of Chicago.  The food was outstanding and the bun was fresh. And I have to agree with Yelper Dave O. that this place was better than the Al's that I used to go to in Chicago (Addison; IL). Another big plus is that this place has free refills on soda; unlike the Al's in Chicago (probably why they went out of business). I do not like going to any place that doesn't have refills.  Al's has a fairly large outdoor patio on the side of the restaurant and plenty of parking. Note to Restaurant owner; please turn down the outdoor music a few notches; it's way too loud.  I will be a regular customer and up my rating once that outdoor music situation is fixed.,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people; earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!,1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes; extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go; I'd say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. I'd say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am; definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american; cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didn't have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasn't too greasy or hard to eat while driving. They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you aren't up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,The first night I went here I had an Italian beef sandwich.  I thought there was something wrong with it because it had a strange flavor; but then I heard from  other people that went there that their sandwich also had a strange flavor.  The beef was also powdery.  Not sure what is going on with this; but it is not good.  We also ordered Chicago style hot dogs.  They are not Chicago style which is what I would expect from a company that is from Chicago.  It did not have a poppy seed bun.  It did not have a pickle spear.  It did not have tomatoes.,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,The food and service is good; but what ruins this place is its high price and lack of authenticity.  Nothing about this franchise location reminds me of Al's #1 Italian Beef in Chicago.  It's a good Italian beef; just not what I think of when I think of Al's.  The beef is good quality and delicious; but it's just missing the correct flavor that you get in Chicago.  The giardiniera (hot peppers) are perfectly spicy and the sweet peppers offer a wonderful additional flavor to the sandwich.  I paid $8.00 for a regular sandwich (with tax).  Not expensive for Italian Beef; especially since it was quite filling; but it still felt a little steep considering it would be at least another $3 or $4 for fries and a drink.  I think the biggest problem with this location is space.  The dining room is huge; although there really aren't that many tables.  The middle is wide open as if there's going to be a massive lunch rush.  However; at 12:30 on a Monday afternoon; the place was dead.  I haven't been to the real Al's since I was a kid; but I remember it as being a little dive.  It would've been a lot smarter for Al's to be in a much smaller spot; maybe they could charge less for their beef if they didn't have to pay so much for their square-footage.  Unfortunately for Al's; there's already a few Chicago hotdog/Italian beef joints in the Raintree area.  Name recognition to Chicagoans is the best thing Al's has going for it.  But; that's what has me the most disappointed because my expectations were way too high going in.  **TIP** If you're not from Chicago; order your sandwich dipped.  This means dunked in au jus after its assembled.  It's messy but wonderful.  The only real way to eat an Italian beef.,0

m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"This place was a disappointment.    I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since I've moved back to AZ; I am always in search of a good one.  Lately; on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun; I stop at Portillo's in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to.  The Italian Beef sandwich at Al's just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet; but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me.  To top it off; the service wasn't the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off; we ordered a \chopped\"" salad.  The lettuce wasn't even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  It's the little things.  We ended up leaving disappointed.  It was a bust for us and definitely not worth the trek from Chandler.""",0

m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,The sandwiches were alright but nothing too special about the place. Prices are good; service is friendly as well.,1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"There's a sign inside of Al's that reads; \The Best Sandwiches in America.\"" That title must have been self proclaimed. The BEST sandwiches in America? Hardly!  I work in North Scottsdale and know that the area is saturated with restaurants; particularly sandwich shops. I have my pick of the litter; so to speak; but on this day I dropped in on Al's; which I'd heard was new to the area. Someone in my office had tried the place so I figured I'd give it a go. The restaurant itself is nice; afterall; it's North Scottsdale and everything there is just a little bit nicer than everywhere else. I have no qualms with the decor. It's the food and the service I take issue with.   Now; I used to work in the food industry; albeit; fast food; but food nonetheless. I know what it's like to serve people since I was a cashier. A cashier should reflect the face of the business; and a positive one at that; if they hope to make any money. The cashier who greeted me at Al's was anything but friendly. She was cordial but bordering on being annoyed; either at me directly or over the fact that she had to work that day. Regardless of her reason; she made me feel like I was a burden to her; instead of feeling welcome.   I'd taken a quick look at the menu; which was pretty basic. There were french fries in various states of being drowned in either bleu cheese or nacho sauce. No thanks; I passed on those. There were hot dogs; sausage and beef sandwiches; their signature dish. I; however; decided to take a healthier route and went with the char-grilled; grilled onion chicken sandwich for around six bucks. Everything is a la carte there; as there are no \""value meals.\"" Fine. I paid my $6 and got a glass of water. I sat down and waited for my order to come up....and I waited; and waited. Finally; after 15 minutes; (which to me; seems like a long time for one chicken sandwich) it came up. This better be a darned good chicken sandwich; I thought to myself.  I unwrapped the foil wrapper and dug in. The roll was light and fluffy but that's where the good stuff ends. The onions were cut in such a way that they all fell out of the sandwich. Had they been able to stay on the sandwich they may have lended some flavor to it.The chicken itself was dry and tasteless. If it wasn't for the fact that it was drowned in ketchup and mustard (dripping down my arm) there would be no flavor at all. What really bothered me the most was the dry texture of the chicken coupled with the dryness of the roll. I had to take sips of water to keep my mouth from drying out.   Overall; my experience at Al's was not so good. The service was mediocre and the food was even worse. Even though I only tried one thing on the menu I am not tempted to go back to try anything else. I have to believe that if this sandwich was of bad quality then the rest of their food will be the same. I'm sorry to say; but there were no redeeming qualities about the sandwich shop that claims to have \""The Best Sandwich In America.\""""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"There's a sign inside of Al's that reads; \The Best Sandwiches in America.\"" That title must have been self proclaimed. The BEST sandwiches in America? Hardly!  I work in North Scottsdale and know that the area is saturated with restaurants; particularly sandwich shops. I have my pick of the litter; so to speak; but on this day I dropped in on Al's; which I'd heard was new to the area. Someone in my office had tried the place so I figured I'd give it a go. The restaurant itself is nice; afterall; it's North Scottsdale and everything there is just a little bit nicer than everywhere else. I have no qualms with the decor. It's the food and the service I take issue with.   Now; I used to work in the food industry; albeit; fast food; but food nonetheless. I know what it's like to serve people since I was a cashier. A cashier should reflect the face of the business; and a positive one at that; if they hope to make any money. The cashier who greeted me at Al's was anything but friendly.

m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,O. M. F'ing. Gee!   It was so good; and delivery was so fast...like faster than freaky fast...it was like Roadrunner fast...or Speedy Gonzales 'ANDALE ANDALE ARRIBA ARRIBA YEE HAW YEE HAW' rapido; or like 'Chip; I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey!' fast...and just as quickly; it was gone.  To be honest; I don't even think the italian beef sandwich; drenched and then smothered in sweet and hot peppers with provolone cheese; even knew what hit it. One moment; it's all safe; warm & cozy in its pot; skillet; oven...wherever italian beef comes from; then BAM! it's whisked off on a whirlwind adventure; delivered and not even 10 minutes later swimming in tummy acid. Happy tummy acid.   To be frank (because I guess I already used 'To Be Honest'); I have enjoyed other tamales w/ chili and cheese a *skosh* better (not bad; but not the best ever); but the italian beef sandwich today has me hooked (plus they have pink lemonade AND deliver; and that ALWAYS makes working Tygers happy).   Lots of delicious sounding stuff on the menu; I'm looking forward to trying the chicago dog and the buffalo bleu fries.   One note to the delivery driver/to-go order specialists/management:   When delivering a giant mess of a sandwich; make sure to also include napkins; fork and knife. Maybe even some of those moist towelettes they give to bbq revelers. While Clinton and Lewinski may think it's cute to have a little mess on a dress; the people I work with do not appreciate it. *  *Just kidding; no dresses were harmed during the scarfing down of this meal.*,1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,Thanks to Groupon; we've dined at this place several times.  Each time; I've had the Beef Sandwich....here's how I order it:  - Dry w/Gravy on the side (Choices are Dry; Dipped; Wet)  - Hot Giardiniera Peppers (Choices are Hot or Sweet Peppers) - Provolone Cheese (Choices are Provolone; Cheddar; Cheese Whiz) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/als-beef-scottsdale?select=jzfT8qobYwYp5wxuFxOF4g#jzfT8qobYwYp5wxuFxOF4g  Let me tell you that the Beef is legit here!  This is an authentic Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich!  The Beef is moist; full of flavor; and the Bread holds it all together perfectly.  The Giardiniera is hot and spicy and makes the Sandwich even better.  I like to get the Gravy on the side so I can add more flavor as needed while I'm devouring the Sandwich.  The French Fries here are awesome too.  They remind me of the Fries at 5 Guys except they don't have the spice options that they offer there.  Doesn't matter; the Fries here are excellent....and addicting.    The rest of the family loves this place too.  We're very happy to have it so close to our neighborhood.  Return Factor - 97%,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I guess we felt like a hotdog...hahaha. Saw the hot dog man on the corner of the street earlier in the week and needed to grab a quick bite before heading out for errands. I guess this place is known for the beef sandwiches. We will try that next time. Decent vienna beefs.  A little thin; but we scarfed them down. The dogs come with a hand full of fries in the hotdog wrapper.  We ordered fries anyway; because we did not know this. Fries are good.  They remind me of old school steak fries in a steamy kind of way.  They are not crunchy; they are kinda 'limpy' but tasty!,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"There's just something in a restaurant's name that will lure me for a visit. Like Al's Beef. Those words together conjure up fantastical images of hunky blue collared workers. You know the ones; they work hard and play harder; each one starving; looking to get his fill of Al's thick juicy Italian Beef sandwiches.  In 1938; Al's Beef opened as a food stand in Chicago's Little Italy. The idea for the Italian Beef sandwich came during the Depression when meat was scarce. So; in order to help stretch the meat to feed more people; the roasted beef was shaved extremely thin; then made into sandwiches.  Over the years; Al's flourished; earning accolades such as Best Sandwich in America from Esquire; Playboy and others. They were even featured earlier this year on one of my favorite TV shows; Man vs. Food; in an episode titled \Da Italian Stance.\""  In Chicago; there's an art to eating an Al's Italian Beef sandwich. In the \""Italian Stance;\"" the diner's knees are slightly bent; posterior slightly up and out and elbows on the counter. This technique helps to avoid getting Al's gravy on your shoes. It's not the traditional gravy you might think of putting on mashed potatoes; but more like the pan drippings from the roasted beef they dunk the entire sandwich in; bread and all.  Unfortunately; all of this amazing history and media attention doesn't seem to matter to the new franchised location in North Scottsdale. The concept here is fast casual; order from the counter; then getting your number called a few minutes later to pick up your food.  The interior was spotlessly clean; the staff relatively friendly and the concept easy; what's not to like? Unfortunately; the food.  I started with the Big Al ($7.45); the 8-inch version of their Italian Beef sandwiches. I want to eat it like Chicagoans do; so I ordered the sandwich dipped; then covered with hot giardiniera; a relish of pickled peppers and vegetables. Taking my position; with my butt in the air and my elbows on the counter top; I took the first bite. First I was amazed just how juicy the sandwich was. Then another surprise hit me -- the meat was almost flavorless.  I was so disappointed that after a few bites I decided to try a Chicago Dog ($3.10). But the hot dog was so small and shriveled I wasn't sure you could call it a hot dog; more like a hot mess.  There were a few highlights; including the delicious Bleu Cheese Fries ($4.50); perfectly cooked French fries covered with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing. Another treat was the Tamale Boat ($5.80); two Chicago-style tamales covered with chili; cheddar cheese and onions.  When one of the employees decided that it was time for Headbangers Ball; playing thrash metal over the restaurant's loudspeakers; I took it as my cue to leave.  Maybe this place should be renamed Al's French Fried Tamale Mosh Pit? Rock on man; rock on.""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,Once again; Groupon led me to a great place to grab a quick; delicious dinner!  My wife and I really enjoyed the signature sandwich...which indeed is the main attraction.  The hot dog and burger were also tasty; and our order didn't take long.   I've already recommended this place to friends; and I have no doubt that I may see myself there again soon.,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"Stopped in today for lunch. There's a reason this place is famous. Really fantastic sandwich. I had the same sandwich that won best sandwich on that Man vs Food show - absolutely delicious.   The owners are awesome family franchisees who were friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was gorgeous and immaculate as well. For a fast-casual restaurant; this place seemed pretty upscale and professional. The truth is; this is a very small chain based out of Chicago with only a few locations outside of IL... and only one in Arizona so far.   You can't go into this thinking \Cheesesteak\"" (not that you would)... it's a really flavorful italian beef. You also have to expect that the bread is going to get a little soggy from the meat juices. The bread they use is great and even though I let my sandwich sit for a bit; it didn't get too soggy at all. Just soaked up the flavors a bit - only the last bit of bread at the end was a little wet.   The fries were hand cut (the owner was proud of this - as he should be); and delicious. Know that you can order your fries however you like them - regular; crispy; no salt or extra salty.   I hope they open more locations - this one delivers around the area; so that's rad. Makes me wish I lived closer. I'm definitely going back to try a dog - haven't had one in awhile. I just got back from a trip to Chicago too; so it will be fun to compare. So far; it's spot-on. The closest thing to this I can think of is Luke's which is different. Both are good.  I really don't understand some of the negative reviews here... this place is immaculate; everyone is nice; and the food is awesome. Italian beef might not be for everyone; but there's something for everyone here.""",1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"I kept hearing about how great Al's beef was so I knew I had to try it for myself. I looked over the menu and ordered the regular Al (6\) and an order of the buffalo blue fries (Real potatoes drizzled with chunky blue cheese and tangy hot sauce. I would say the Italian beef had a unique taste not sure if that was a good thing. The fries on the other hand kicked ass I would order them again for sure.""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"What to say?  Meh!  Although it might be 2.5 stars; but it's for sure not 3.  One more place that I can add to my list of things that don't live up to the hype.  Had the Italian Beef and Chicago Dog.  First the beef.  You could tell the beef was pretty good quality and to my surprise there was more than enough of it for my tastes.  We ordered the sandwich dipped so the good news is that it made the bread edible.  Had it not been that way I expect the clearly stale bread would have been on the inedible side.  As for flavor about the only thing you could taste was the dip.  The beef had no discernible flavor on it's own.  Having said that I found the dip to be high on the pepper side and as such I got to taste it for several hours later.  Now the hot dog.  I don't claim to be an expert on Chicago cuisine; but I'm pretty sure a Chicago dog includes  celery salt.  None here...nada; zip; zero.  Oddly enough that little missing ingredient makes a lot of difference.  The dog also comes with fries.  Now most places on the planet the fries come on a separate plate/bag/cup/whatever.  Not here.  Fries come wrapped in the paper that contains the dog.  I wasn't digging this little innovation.  There are all kinds of signs/posters in the place telling you about how good the sandwich is and who says so.  Also on one of those TV food/travel channel competitions the beef sandwich was named the winner for the midwest region as the best sandwich in America.  As of this writing the overall winner hasn't been named but if the beef sandwich comes even remotely close to winning; I'm going to throw my TV out the window.    This place isn't even remotely close to where I live; but since I was in the neighborhood we stopped in.  I wouldn't make a special trip; but I might give it a try again (just to see if I can \get it\"") if I'm ever back in the neighborhood.""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I am so disappointed with my first experience!  We came in as a party of 4; the last person didn't get their meal until 15 minutes after the rest of us sat down.  I ordered a polish dog - and to my horror after biting in; a huge piece of plastic!  The manager offered to make me something else; but it's a hot dog; that you cover with toppings - they aren't paying attention; which makes me wonder; how much is really looked over.    On top of plastic; the overall customer service was lackluster.  The girl behind the register was rude and you could tell she took no pride in her job.   Overall; very disappointed!,0

m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I'm a Chicago North Sider so I was not familiar with Al's from back in my Chicago days.  I have always been a huge fan of Portillos however I had to give Al's a shot.  HAPPY DAY!  Had a beef; dipped; sweet and an order of Cheese fries.  It was the best beef I have had in years.  Hot; juicy and just enough spice to give it a kick without going over the top.  Needless to say I will be back to Al's on a regular basis.,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,Wow! I'm so glad Al's Beef is back and it is waaaaaaay better! This time the beef portion is much better for the $$ and the service was truly a great experience coming from the fast food joints! I'm definatley coming back soon and I will bring my family and friends as well! Thanks for re-opening Al's Beef!,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"I should have known better that since the Cubs have spring training in Arizona; there must be a Chicago eatery around.  And there is one- one that I actually saw on tv once!  Thankfully it was Al's beef.  Go up; order; and they call your order when it's ready.  I got a Big Al; w/cheese and hot peppers- dipped.  Also got a side of chili-chese fries.  The place was big and clean; and of course; had the classic \Welcome to Chicago\"" slogan on the front door.  I couldn't imagine it any other way.  The sandwich was literally the best I have had.  The bread was soaked but still held up as I chomped it.  The peppers were finely chopped and gave it a great flavor that I cannot compare it too.  The only thing that prevented me from giving this place 5 stars was the huge Pepsi machine they had...  I think too for the price; you get a great deal.  The place isn't limited to beef; so keep that in mind if you are looking for something else to chomp on!""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,Chicago's #1 Italian Beef since 1938 (in the old Prickly Pear).  It was actually quite yummy!  Just make sure you order your sandwich wet or dipped; do NOT go plain!  And; don't forget the sweet peppers (loved 'em) or the hot giardiniera.  Also; don't waste your time on Little Al!   The sandwich was really good; it wasn't too heavy or greasy.  Though; the fries were soggy; not a fan; maybe better next time?    Looking forward to going back and trying everything else!,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"When I lived near Chicago I only ate at an Al's once.  Not particular reason.  I just chose to buy my beef at Portillo's.  But I was happy to see a place to buy Italian beef at a location closer to me than Dazzo's.  I ordered a regular beef with hot peppers; provolone and had it dipped (an absolute must).  The beef was pretty good.  I'm not too picky with my Italian beef and feel it's difficult to mess up (I went to a Rosati's in Queen Creek and the sandwich was baked!  WTF!).  In my humble opinion; when folks talk about who has the best beef it's typically the place they grew up eating.  I never found much of a difference between beef options in Chicago.    The restaurant was clean and orderly.  Service was blase and one worker was a bit rude with a guy asking where his order was.  I was eating with a Chicago native and a guy that spent time in the burbs.  They ordered the Chicago dogs and neither were impressed.  The toppings were skimpy and not messy enough for their taste.  I'm not a fan of the Chicago dog myself as I feel there's too much vegetation on it.  If you could trick a PETA person into eating the dog because the veggies overpower the dog; that's not a real hot dog.  Just saying.  They both referred to the dogs as \terrible\"" but try it out for yourself if the Chicago dog is your thing.  Dazzo's is still my pick for Italian beef in the Phoenix area but Al's is still good and worth a visit.""",0

m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,WOW!!  The new owners of the Al's on Northsight have it down pat! My beef was perfect; as authentic Chicago as it gets (and that's coming from a REAL Chicagoan). My wife loved the fact that they've added salads and wraps. Now I can bring her more often. We were surrounded by great people; great service; and smiling faces. Kudos to the new owners.  Great job!!,1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,Management or lack thereof have ruined this place - zero service and food has become completely mediocre..,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I went to Al's today. The place is clean and the seating is good. The soda fountain is in a weird spot though. I ordered the Nacho fries and a Chicago dog with fries.   Chicago dog. I liked how it was made. There wasn't so much stuff in it that it all fell out every time you take a bite. I hate that when dogs are served that way. Also; I liked that the fries were stuffed in the dog bun along with some onions sport peppers and mustard. I didn't like they dog itself so much; It tasted alright but had a chewiness to it. I might have to try a couple more just to make sure. I give it a 4.   The Nacho fries. A lot of places make custom fries like this but I never had fries that had such a good taste to them. I don't know if my taste buds were playing tricks on me; but I could of sworn near the end of my nacho fries I tasted a sweet Bavarian cream donut taste. Kinda weird huh. I don't know how it got there but I want it again and again.  I give it a 5.   Tomorrow I'm going back to try the beef and maybe the Buffalo bleu fries. If the Beef turns out right I'll have to up the stars.  Ok I've been back like 30 times and have had 30 beefs. I thinks that about sums it up. I even like the smell it puts in my mustache. Sometimes I'll leave it in so a few hours later I can remember just how good lunch was today.,1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I was planning a luncheon for my office and they had a menu for Al's Beef on hand so I gave them a call to see if they fit into our budget. Rich and Barry were very nice and helped me figure out what would be enough to order to feed our group and stay within budget. We exchanged a few phone calls over a few days; decided on a menu; and they delivered it right on time just before our event started. Everyone in the office loved it and I got a ton of questions about where the food was from and how they had heard such great things about Al's Beef. Based on my experience I give them 5-stars but since I didn't get a chance to try the food; I'll have to go in and taste it for myself :),1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"I'm originally from Chicago  and never go back without visiting Portillos at least once.  I am 5'3\ 115 lbs. and my order is a beef sandwich; extra gravy; sweet and hot peppers; an oder of onion rings; a \""Chicago\"" style hot dog; a  tamale and chopped salad.  Oh; and a diet Coke because I'm watching my weight :-)  My brother told me about Al's and thought the beef sandwiches were comparable to Portillos.  Since I didn't have my entire Chicago family with me to help eat my meal; I stuck with the beef sandwich (with hot and sweet peppers and dipped); the tamale and had to go with their french fries because they didn't have onion rings.   The beef sandwich was okay; but wasn't as good as Portillos.  I guess my main complaint would be the giardineria.  While they say the giardineria is freshly made; I've had better from a jar.  Although it was spicy; the taste was a bit off.  The fries.  According to the menu; they are freshly cut and made each day.  They need to send somebody over to In-N-Out Burger to see how its properly done.  They were not that good.   The tamale.  People born and raised in AZ may not appreciate these types of tamales; but they are what I grew up on.  Al's tamale came in a plastic wrapper (are these picked up from Costco in boxes of 24?) and are nuked.  I guess in the day they were steamed; but with the introduction of the microwave; that's how they are cooked today.  Unfortunately; mine may have been in the microwave a couple seconds too long.  Still edible; but pretty dry.  And it does lose something when it comes in that plastic wrap.  I didn't have a chance to check out their hot dogs or chopped salad.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there again (which I did today); but if I were in the area; I would go back and try the dog and chopped salad.  Luke's is being opened down the street from my home; so I'll have to do a comparison.  In the years I have been in Arizona I have yet to be impressed by any establishment claiming that something is \""Chicago\"" style.  I'm not quite sure why it's so difficult.  Portillos does have two stores in the Los Angeles suburbs - when I have a hankering; I am just going to have to hop in the car and take a road trip  for lunch!""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"Time for another review...my first visit to the NEW Al's wasent so great.....but in my review I did say I would be back to try the beef.  Let me start by saying...I am a VERY tough critic....I know what I like and if you advertise anything Chicago...that is what I compare to...not other local business.....  I stopped by at 11am ...(my thinking is everything will be fresh)...and I did order a regular size beef and small fry....  I was still not thrilled that it cost over $10.00 for a beef and small fry...however... I dont mind paying more if I feel its worth it...and in this girls opinion....the beef was TERRIFIC!  I did order the beef wet...with au jus and their homemade peppers on the side.  The beef (as previously reviewed by someone else) was dry and a bit bland...however...once I poured the au jus and peppers over it.....BAM!!!!  The flavors EXPLODED!    The sandwich was ample and two of us shared it and we were both very satisfied.  I like a beef sandwich that is NOT thick pieces of beef...and this was exactly that...  Lots of beef and the bread was nicely saturated in the yummy juices....  When I was in the restaurant I had the pleasure of speaking to Michelle...one of the owners  who was very interested in my opinion....so much so that she asked me to call her and let her know what I think...  I did just that....so Michelle....this review is for you....and for all of you Chicagoians out there who enjoy a really hefty and flavorful Italian beef.  If you went to Al's once....my suggestion is.....give it another try and order something different to get the true experience.  I will DEFINATELY be back for the Beef     I realize food is really  personal preference....  Some think Lukes is good....to me Lukes is BAD food at EXTREMELY high prices...I tried it once and wont ever go back....so bad I went against my rule of always trying a restaurant  at least twice...just to make sure....    So; if you are comparing Al's to Luke...NO COMPARISON!!!  Al's WINS any day of the week....  It is my opinion...that if it a Beef sandwich you are looking for....no need to go any further than \Al's Italian Beef\""!""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I promise this will be my final review on Al's.  My last review commended them on their Beef sandwich....ok...so heres the thing... If you get there at the right time of the day (when they open when everything is fresh and the beef hasent been sitting in hot water all day) you get a good beef sandwich(as long as you add the peppers for taste..which btw they charge you for);     however if you get there around 5pm the beef is soggy and tasteless.... sorry michelle and Burt but I gotta tell it how it is.  Now for a simple thing like a hot dog.... ok; so the dog is small; taste is everything....theres the key word....taste....  So heres the thing....if you order a hot dog; tell them exactly how you want the condiments; otherwise you will end up with a hot dog saturated in relish or other ingredients....now some people might like a little hot dog with their relish; but not me.  Now; lets get to Al's redeeming quality....the fries......  So heres the thing..... if you want overly salted well done fries then dont say anything; but if you want golden fries with salt to your liking(like the picture they show); then ask them to not cook them as long and NO SALT!  I have had several friends go to Al's and unfortunately have not had good reviews from them so I will let people read the reviews and decide for themselves.  Overall; if you want to stop at a hot dog joynt and have to dictate exactly how to prepare your food; then Al's is the place for you.  I wish I could suggest a good hot dog place but I just havent found one yet so if anyone has any VALID suggestions..... please share.  I will be moving from Scottsdale in a few months and when I do chances are I wont be back to Al's because it simply is not worth going out of the way for.  Al's is simply not consistent and I hate spending good money on bad food.  The owners (btw) are very nice; but nice doesnt bring the customers back  The decision is yours.....try it or dont try it but until then.......  Bon Appetite',1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"Al's Beef in Chicago was never one of my regular places that I ventured to to grab an Italian beef. There are so many other small \ma & pa\"" places that I pretty much passed Al's up. That being said; I at least got to try it in Scottsdale!  I ordered a sausage and beef combo with hot giardiniera and some fries. The fries were decent - crispy and salty. The giardiniera was great; and definitely looked and tasted like it was taken out of a big pot in back rather than a big jar from a wholesale store. The beef was also tasty and definitely seemed like it had been marinating in its juices for a couple hours. Everything was pretty good until the sausage. The sausage was an alright link; but it wasn't hot; it was cooling off. From \""order up\"" to table to mouth is all it took; seemingly. I really like my hot sandwiches piping hot; especially when that sandwich is an Italian beef (hybrid). Shite happens unfortunately though; and at least the flavors were pretty good.   I'd give Al's another go. It passes; but didn't win me over.""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"Allrighty then...  It's time to poke the pig I like to call \Controversy\""!  I know it's going to sound like heresy; but I'm just going to come out with it...I like Italian Beef Sandwiches better than Philly Cheesesteaks!  I'll give you a minute to clean up the spit on your screen...there you go...there's still a little to your right...no; right...good; all bright and shiny again!  It's true; I really do!  Not that I don't like cheesesteaks; I just like the full dip Italian Beef (made the right way...the Chicago; stand up at the counter and lean over to keep from getting the drippings on your shoes way); better!  And Al's delivers on the better Italian Beef!  Huge sandwiches; made in every conceivable manner (maybe too many options on the menu; but I suppose someone likes some the of the more esoteric choices); but really; there is only one way to make this sandwich for me...Full Dip; Provolone and hot Giardiniera...chock full of beefy; cheesy; spicy; peppery goodness!  The kind of goodness that mere napkins can't remove...oh sure; they can soak up some of the greasy drips...smear things around on your hands and face a little bit; that sort of thing...but you're going to need a shower after lunch at Al's Beef.  And that's how it should be!  My buddy and I met for lunch last week and we tried the new Al's franchise for the first time.   For first time franchisers (from Chicago; BTW; so they know how these things are supposed to look and taste); they do a nice job...And I should note how nice everyone is at Al's...so...noted!  The service was reasonably good; and while they did forget to put Giardiniera on my sandwich; they were quick to give me a couple of cups of their house blend to fork over onto my sandwich...you just aren't getting the entire experience without the pickled peppers!  My buddy and I sat and talked and the sandwiches quickly disappeared; along with a pretty decently made; tasty side of fries...I know; I know...I can't eat that way every day (or really; every week) if I want to live to a ripe old age of 149...but I'm not sure that I want to live that long if I can't get my Italian Beef sandwich from time to time!  So my new strategy is to extend my life by forgoing  the cheesesteaks and replacing them with Italian Beef; now that we have a couple of decent places in town (sorry DeFalco's...you know I love you; but; for the love of Jebus; dip my sandwich...don't just give me a little plastic \""sample cup\"" of au jus).  Of course; that life extension strategy will only work if the mob doesn't come after me with torches and pitchforks for writing that a good Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich is better than a Philly Cheesesteak!""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,Okay; so I visited Al's again for the first time since they opened. Whoa; where to begin.   We ordered the Italian Beef combo w/sausage and a double Chicago style Red Hot; that came without drinks to $12.   The beef was cut so thin and was sitting in the juice for so long that is was a pile of mush; and I ordered it dry. Go figure. The double Red Hots must have been in water too long since there was no snap in the Vienna beef hot dogs and the bun was moist. So what can I say?  One star at best from my original four when they first opened.    Oh; what I would give for a Super Dawg or a Gold Coast. Heh; maybe they'll open a Lou Malnati's someday?,0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"This review is for the \NEW\"" Al's Beef restaurant which opened on December 19; 2011 under a new management team.  One of my fellow Yelper's and I came here for lunch this past week and we were both very impressed.  Under the new owners; they have improved on the old food service by doing away with the smaller Hot Dog (almost kid's size) and went with the regular sized Vienna Beef.  One of my previous complaints.   Also improved; is their signature Beef sandwich which is now tastier and what you expect a Chicago Beef sandwich to be!    The old owners served a very mushy; too thinly slided version of the sandwich which was hard to like no matter how you asked them to make it.  The new sandwich is very much like Al's Beef in Chicago.  It might even be as good as Portillo's.  I had the Italian Beef Combo \""dry\""; which means it came with an Italian grilled sausage in the middle; with juice on the side.  It was delicious!  The new owners came around and handed out frequent dinners cards and introduced his wife and himself.  The old restaurant didn't seem to have owners on the premises.  Go figure why they had a problems; huh?  Enjoy!""",1
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"Dear Barry--  I have an observation; more than a review.  When we first moved here nearly five years ago.  The only place in town to get some Chicago food was Luke's.  Then Al's opened; but failed miserably and closed quickly.   You can still see my Two Star review.    This time last year (December 19; 2011); you took over and re-opened Al's; making it a genuine Chicago place.   King Scott and I came by after the re-opening and thought it was just as good as the one on 1079 W. Taylor Street;http://www.yelp.com/biz/als-no-1-italian-beef-chicago in Chicago's \Little Italy\"" near UIC; or the one on West Adams http://www.yelp.com/biz/als-italian-beef-chicago   What really knocked me out; were all the One Star; No profile Picture; One Review Yelp'ers who wanted to dump on your (Barry's) parade.  Who knew that Chicago dogs were so competitive here in Arizona?    I myself got a bunch of \""Neg-heads\"" writing private messages; saying they couldn't eat here; never had a bite of the food; but thought the place was crap.  Or; the cheap-ohs who thought the prices were too high.  Geez!  I just came back from having lunch ($9.50) here and had a great time.  I ordered the Italian combo dipped; with gravy on the side.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I still go to Luke's from time to time; but Barry (Al) please know; you make a good Chicago Italian Beef!   Congrats to you and thank you for persevering!    --R/Georgie""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"Bottom line: the new owners bring you better beef than Al's in Chicago. Yes-they really do.  Italian food tastes better in Italy (usually). That meal on a dock in Sausalito is not the same even if you copy it exactly when you get home. Food is an experience that is altered by the location; mood; companions and results.  So; being at Al's in Scottsdale is not the same as being in Chicago...that's obvious; so get over the fact that you're stuck in North Scottsdale; and not in the Windy City. But the new owner's seem to have this place clicking. The sandwich is awesome; and they work the floor to check on your experience. They care. I read a bad review about a hambuger here...are ya nuts? Al's...ditch the burger...who cares? and customer...what the heck brought you here for a burger? Sheeesh. I digress...again.  I have always enjoyed a trip to Al's in Chicago. Portillo's; Johnny's; and don't even get me going on the Portillo's vs Al's debates; but even though Al's beef wasn't always the best quality; the combination of beef; grease; jardiniere; gravy (jus); spices; and peppers at Al's has always nailed it flavor-wise for my palate. When I worked in Phoenix; a trip to Luke's on Indian School every few months would deliver an OK time; but it didn't really satisfy my craving for great Italian beef. The first franchise for Al's at this location; brought those flavors I was craving; but messed up everything else about running a restaurant; and I still went back; and was sad to see them not make a go of it.  Unfortunately; that left a flavor void; and I kept waiting for new Management to get open...and just before they did; I went on a very serious training and diet regime. My latest race results and training schedule gave me a little room for coming off the regime a little; and I decided today was my perfect cheat day...I mean Al's day.  They really nailed it. My fries were wonderful (I was eating them while they were bringing me hot sauce)....crisp; slightly browned; gooey in the middle; loaded with flavor; without being over-salted.   The beef was absolutely great; better meat than original Al's in Chicago; as good as Portillo's in meat quality; but with all those insanely fantastic flavors I remember from my best sandwiches at Al's. Definitely one of my best sandwiches so far in 2012...and I highly suggest the \Wet; with a side of gravy\"" method.  Many may object; (oh; ye lazy masses) but; I think Al's tradition of fully-dipped sandwiches leaves you with a sodden mess; that takes the bread out of the sandwich equation. If you are indeed- lazy; well then the dipped style gives you more wet bread that has soaked up that insanely good flavor combination. So if you are lazy; and also-messy; get it dipped. But there is a better way- it just takes a little work and technique...so simple it's easily mastered by a hungry 7 year-old; but they can also fix a frozen iPhone; so....  The perfect compromise is to order the sandwich Wet; with a big side of gravy (no charge for that- thank god). You can pour large amounts of the jus into the end as you go (obviously held upright); pinching the sandwich down below your planned bite; so the jus doesn't just run through; but soaks the meat and that portion of the bread from the inside out. Lot's of the jus is what Al's beef needs to soak the meat and release that delicious flavor combination; absolutely soaking the bread too; but maintaining the sandwich integrity; while adding in a tiny little bread crunch on the outside.   (As a caution: you can order the beef \""Dry\"". My advice if that would be your choice: don't go here. This is not a sandwich that is designed to be eaten dry- the beef will be flavorless and without charm. A Roast Beef from a good deli will be awesome if that is what you are in the mood for)  \""Wet; gravy on the side; sweet and hot peppers; cup of hot sauce.\"". Spice the gravy up with hot sauce to your taste; pinch that sandwich; and pour as you go.  Freaking awesome sandwich; that blows away the local alternatives. And I'm perfectly happy with a spotless; new interior in North Scottsdale. I don't need Chicago memorabilia or grungy atmosphere to enhance my sandwich experience when the beef is this good. Bring a few good friends; order up a few beef; try a combo with sausages; share and compare; and start your own great dining tradition. Very cool to think that I won't be jamming a daily Italian beef into every Chicago trip just because I couldn't get them anywhere else.   Gotta step up the training another notch so this can be a weekly lunch choice; because I am stuffed right now; and I still want more of that flavor!!""",0
m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,After a friend raved about the food; we decided to try Al's.  My husband ordered the beef sandwich; which he said was okay.  I ordered a hot dog; which was disappointing.  It was small and not satisfying (and I am usually a light eater).  The atmosphere is good though (clean and no customer service complaints).  We were really hoping to be blown away by the food and were disappointed that is was just okay.  Our comparison is Dickie's Dogs at McDowell Mountain Ranch.  Dickie's had amazing food but unfortunately is now closed :(,0

po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,I am a fan; as far as the fast food industry goes. I am not usually a big fast food eater. But i was with a mom and 3 kids at the time. Tater tots; yummmm!! I am huge burger girl and will say they were pretty good. I like the convince of this place.  Pull up; order; swipe ur card and the bring the food to your car!  Watching and hoping they dont fall in their roller skates with the food! haha; I was so hungry!  I think I will be back next time in AZ :),1
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,Pull up to your spot; order your food; and it is brought out to your car. All the while 50's - classic rock tunes are playing over the speaker system. As far as fast food chains go this is one of the better ones. Nothing like feeling a touch of nostalgia of a drive-in joint where you can sit in your car with the windows open in beautiful weather and have the food brought to you.   Happy hour from 2-4 where all the drinks are half price! Can't beat a Big Gulp sized Grape Slushie and Blue Coconut Slushie for only $1 each! Along with some tastily seasoned popcorn chicken; a ranch chicken wrap; and perfectly crispy tater tots this was a winning quick lunch!  Yum - tater tots!  Seems so seemless here. Pull up; press the red button; place your order; and within minutes it is brought to your car with a smile. If you want to eat outside there are some tables and chairs on a small patio in the front. How can anyone not like this?  Grape slushie....Mmmmmm.,1
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,Why aren't there Sonics in MA?? It's a great alternative to other fast food; even if it isn't all that much healthier.  We made a stop right before heading to the airport and my breakfast burrito of ham and cheese was simple; but great. And the strawberry smoothie I had along with it really hit the spot.   The popcorn chicken we saved to eat on the plane was ok; the Toaster chicken sandwich was better; but both probably should be eaten piping hot.  And can I just say - what better idea than to order and have food brought to your car in the winter in New England? Brillant; I'm telling you I should open a franchise!,0
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,Hilarious that I'm the third Californian to review this Sonic's.  As it were; there just aren't any here for us to go to!    While I've been the ONE i've found in SoCal (Anaheim); this one was quicker and had twice as many places to park.  It also had a drive-up one... well; it seemed like a normal drive in. People left instead of eating in their cars.  Anyways; you guys all know how it works.  Push the magical red button; order to your hearts content (GET A CHERRY LIMEADE!); and anxiously await.  There are no skates; though there was a guy who had a tray of extra napkins; ketchup; etc who walked around.  Nice touch Scottsdale.  I always get a hamburger with mayo.  I was drunk the first time I had it and thought it was the best thing I had ever eaten.  Now that I've eaten it while sober; I still think it's pretty damn good.,0
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,So my bf and I wanted a drink and snacks since it was happy hour at 2 we went and we were in a bit of a hurry cause my bf had to go to work at 3 so it just turned 2 so we weren't really in a rush since we THOUGHT they would give us our meal in 5 min NOPE we pull up;press the red button it lights up......nothing we do it again...nothing. People next to is pulled up and ordered already. So we back out and go into another menu same thing waited about 2 min then they finally answered I asked is one of you menu broken? They said nope. So I told them what happens and we been waiting for 5-8 mins for someone to answer then they said o yeah one of the menus is broken. So I'm like alright and we ordered room about 15 min till our order came and that's when we were in a rush. Another time my bf ordered chili cheese fries they gave him what looked/tasted like plastic cold cheese fries and my strawberry limeade had way to many strawberry chunks in it I felt like I didn't even drunk anything mostly ate the strawberries and could really taste some syrup Idk it was too sweet! They need to retrain or idk but they been messing up a lot. Not gonna go here again,0
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,"The customer service at this Sonic is HORRIBLE!!!

po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,"During my time living in Maryland I've seen a good deal of Sonic commercials on the tele.  Being that I have never seen a Sonic; I was perplexed by these commercials.  So; using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren't any Sonics in the state of Maryland.  When I moved to my new home of San Diego; I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?  One night; my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \What the fvck's a Sonic?\"" I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light; as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.  Now; I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to; but to this; my virgin Sonicage; I can.  There is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs; drinks; slushies; smoothies; ice cream sundaes; banana splits; etc.  As if this wasn't enough; they also have a drive-thru.  Again my perplexion returned.  The awful shine of it all; the harshness on weary eyes... It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.  While we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.  Jen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n' cheese bites; I; the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral; waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.  Got home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn't make one's flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.  The drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n' cheese.  Sadly; these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese; eh; not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.  ...and that was and is how I met a Sonic.""",0
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,Would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place.  Ordered a milkshake at 7:59; by the time it arrived it was after 8:00. They are offering their half price shakes after 8:00. Even though it was delivered after 8:00 they wouldn't give it to me at half price because I ordered it one minute too soon.  I hate lazy workers who don't want to be bothered making things right for a customer.,0
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,I am honestly shocked by the good reviews but I guess I am glad others have a better experience here.  Hadn't been to this location in over 3 years due to mediocre service and food. Went today to see if anything has changed. Nope.  Gave us tots instead of fries. Made the Slush Floats were ordered weird... it's suppose to be a slush with ice cream inside UNBLENDED. If this is how they make them now... um... alright. They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy. Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits. They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog. Makes it harder to eat. Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the picture.  Goodbye forever; Sonic.,0

po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,I've been here twice so far and have had great service and fantastic food!   I love the ambience of SONIC...it reminds me of the old drive-ins on Happy Days. It brings that feel-good vibe; along with good times; great food; awesome friends; cruising; and listening to the tunes.,1
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,I can't imagine making it through a hot summer without my Route 44 Diet Cherry Limeades to keep me cool; so I'm a frequent visitor to the Sonic Drive-In back home.  While visiting Phoenix over the July 4th week; this Sonic; on the North side of E. McDowell between N. 48th and N. 51st; became my go-to drink restaurant of choice.  What is unique about this particular Sonic is that there is a drive through; but no drive through window.  Feel free to ponder this for a moment or two.  There is a menu and a speaker where you can order whatever you like; and then you pull forward to... a solid wall on the side of the building.  No window to hand them your cash; and - most distressing of all - no window where they can hand me my humongous frosty beverage.  Well; okay; I did eventually receive my beverage as one of their servers walked out the front door and handed it to me where I tentatively pulled up to the edge of the curb.  Now; I know what you're thinking - Sonic is basically a drive up restaurant where they park and bring your food TO YOU; so why would I insist on driving through?  None of your beeswax; buster; I just do.    In addition to driving up and parking to order; there are plenty of outdoor tables; most with shade; where you can also sit; order; and enjoy your food or beverages.  So; do whatever your little heart desires: park and sit in your car; park and sit at the tables; or order at the drive through and act really confused when you can't find the drive through window.  Just make sure you try the cherry limeade - trust me on this one.,0

po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,What a cool way to buy fast food during a heatwave; late at night in your jammies; or any time.  Daughter was hungry for a Sonic burger#1.   Spotted a Sonic sign ahead. We pulled into the parking lot of a fast food joint. Colorful 3' x 4' screens separated each parking space on the driver's side.   I immediately recognized the old car hop vibe. Pulled into an empty space. Kept the engine running and air condition blasting. The screen turned out to be the menu; speaker; and ATM all in one. WHAT?!?!?! How innovative.  Scanned the menu for items I wanted to order.  Pressed the speaker button to alert the assistant inside that I was ready to order. A very pleasant; disembodied voice took my order; then said she'd be out in a few with my order. Ok; let's see how fast . . .   In the meantime I inserted my credit card to finalize the transaction. Receipt rolled out.  As promised; within minutes a sweet young lady arrived balancing a red tray loaded with 2 paper bags and a couple of drinks. She confirmed my order according to the receipt printed out on her side; then she handed over my booty.  Handed her a tip and I was on my way with a Sonic burger & fries; classic hot dog with the works; condiments; a limeade and a blue coconut slush and 2 peppermint candies. Yaowzaaaaa!  No Sonic anywhere near where I live; but when they show up I'll be one of the first in line. Love their vibe.  http://www.sonicdrivein.com/,1
po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,Two of my colleagues and I had a business lunch at Sonic and tour outing was very fun. I was a novice to the Sonic experience as I took everything in. The parking lot was clean; we had a nice view of a Arizona State Tree - the Palo Verde and a clear perspective of a colorful storage facility. We ordered our lunch through the Sonic Remote Audio device and paid remotely on the same apparatus; via credit card. Our lunch was delivered to the car within minutes; by our cheerful car hop waiter.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich; tater tots(recommended by my friend) and a lemon/berry drink. Everything tasted great; especially enjoyed the great textures & flavor of the tater tots. The drink was perfect for our scorching Phoenix day. Sonic; looking forward to a return for another power lunch.,1
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,I love them too much. Try to limit my visits to once a month because they are just so darn good. Fresh! I have never gotten bad food here. I have always had friendly; fast efficient service. The prices are right; the food is fresh non nonsense straight forward good. I know there's probably 5000 calories in the meal; but plan for the occasion and splurge once in awhile. It's better than McDonalds with a bunch of frozen chemicals.,1
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,Best fast food burger joint around. Always have great service and great food. You be filled up and happy.   Get the double double animal style for a little something extra.

The delish burger sure makes it a great trip too.  Going to In N Out is a \trip\""; it's always busy; so it's not like a quickie run for a burger and fry.    The Fries-- not sure that I like them; I always order them simply b/c everything is so cheap- but I also always eat them.  I think I just like watching the happy staff cut them up.""",1
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,"How does In N Out do it?  The consistency is amazing.  The service is impeccable.  Do these happy boppy teens really love their jobs?

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,Always friendly smiles to ask for your order. Clean fast and fresh. Nothing better than that. Only downside is the long lines inside and in the drive thru.,1
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,In n out...enough said! Amazing customer  service; fresh ingredient and French friends cut and made in front of you daily. I love the double double cheeseburger; protein style; with a chocolate milkshake. Why oh why can't they migrate out to the east coast and Florida!! My ultimate favorite fast food and it's always a treat to go!,1
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,I love this location!  Not that I don't love every In-N-Out location!  The burger; shakes and fries never disappoint. The service is always with a smile; just going through the drive-through puts me in a better mood.  And I LOVE when there is a person standing outside to take my order instead of screaming into a microphone in a box. Yay!,1

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,Went here and omg....the drive thru line was soooo backed up. I can see why though. When I did manage to even get IN the drive thru; I was happily greeted. I LOVE their fries so much. I mean; where else can you get fresh made fries? I also got a chocolate shake. When I finally made it up to the first window to pay; again I was happily greeted. He was equally nice and prompt as the first guy. Then I got up to the second window and waited maybe 2 minutes and there was my food.   Pros of this visit: Everyone was super nice. Prompt service without feeling overly rushed Even though there were a lot of cars; flow of traffic was speedy. Fries tasted awesome (as always) Shake was ok  Cons of this visit: I arrived at rush hour so there was still a 30 minute drive through (Not their fault; but be warned.)  Fries could have been hotter,1
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,I've had In-N-Out in Vegas and LA and this location does not disappoint.

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,"You know the story of regional burger place In-N-Out. They never freeze their meat; so they're only located near their suppliers; which means that unless you're in California; Arizona; Nevada and even Utah; you can't get In-N-Out.  The secret menu I never figured out past asking for my burger \animal style\""; because I pretty much stopped at what I thought was awesome.  This particular franchise is located near a heavily trafficked shopping area north of Phoenix proper; and it is staffed by some very friendly and attentive people. It was clean; it was well kept; and the food was as I expected from my many visits to In-N-Out in California- tasty burger; fresh-cut and slightly greasy fries and cold beverages.  I like the burgers better at Five Guys; but In-N-Out has a charm and a superior level of service that makes it a pleasant place to dine. Someone actually hired the employees here for their customer service skills and not because they were the cheapest help they could find. That is a reason to patronize this location; right there.  Plenty of outdoor seating for the always excellent Valley weather and good for people watching; too.""",1

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,Originally from SoCal; been eating InNOut for 30 years.  Slowest drive service in 30 years at this location.  I was worried they were being held up; or that their line cooked passed out.  Slow; Slow; Slow.,0
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,This is a very busy place for high school kids since the restaurant is open until 1am in the morning.  Great place to hang out with friends for quick bites to eat.  My usual order is 1 hamburger with grilled onions; 2 fries; and cup of water.  Haven't tried the secret menu or any animal style food yet; but heard that they were even better than the original food.  All food were never frozen before; so everything is fresh; especially the fresh cut fries with a bit seasoned salt on it.  Excellent meal and great and fast service every time I go there.,1

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,Best fast food hamburger place in the country. I'm just saying...   Forget what you know about fast food places. In-N-Out Burger is a different breed. Yes; they still have order takers and drive thru windows; but that's where the similarities end. In-N-Out Burger distinguishes itself with high quality fresh food and outstanding service; all served in a sparkling clean environment. Rumor has it they only hire students with high grade point averages to assure competent employees. The difference shows.   The other thing is that they only serve three things: burgers; fries; and beverages. They don't do many things; but they do them well. The burger is 100% pure beef and served with real cheese; fresh juicy tomatoes; and hand-leafed lettuce. Plus; they make every burger one at a time; cooked to order. There isn't even a microwave or heat lamp in the building. The fries are cut in the store; one potato at a time. You can witness whole potatoes being cut as you stand at the order counter.   I don't understand why anyone would want to go to the McDonald's nearby. Maybe nobody has told them about this tasty treasure just down the street?,1

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,This is consistently one of their best locations and I have been to many of them. Food and Service always rate above the rest. These are not gourmet burgers. Simple menu with fresh ingredients and quick service for a great value. There is a top secret menu that you can Google for some fun options.  There is one associate named LUZ who is my favorite and makes this a 5 STAR experience. When she is there she always greets you and helps you get seated while making sure everything is perfect in the dinning area. Her smile; grace and enthusiasm makes me want to come back again and again. Thumbs up!  I normally like to order the 3X3 or the 4X4 with everything then add pickle plus an order of fries with a couple sides of spread. Sometimes I bring some of my home grown Chiltepin Peppers to add some kick. Can get really busy during peak hours. Shares the same parking lot as Sprout's. Just smell for the aroma of grilled onions and beef in the air. Hard to resist.,1

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,In-N-Out; the speed of service and the quality of food exist within the name itself.  Over the years the company has not allowed competitors or customers to affect its quality of food or the incredible assistance it provides constantly.  From the usual double-double with everything on it to the delicious strawberry shake waiting on the counter; In-N-Out products do not cease to please or surprise.  By using exuberant welcoming colors such as yellow; red; and white; sitting inside the restaurant proves to be both enjoyable and exciting.  Simplicity; the key to In-N-Out's success has proven to be a valuable piece in the growth and advancement of the company.  All in all In-N-Out Burger provides both an experience and quality for anyone from 10 to 100 to enjoy!,1

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,After living out west for ages; I moved to San Antonio.  Home to ZERO In-N-Out Burgers!  It was a long few years; but now I am here in Phoenix; and I have been reunited with my old flame.    We picked up just where we left off.  You would never know we hadn't seen or heard from one another in four years.  I took hold of the hot; fresh; juiciness and went to town.  After a few short minutes; it was over.  I wiped the remaining secret sauce from my face.  All I could think about was when we would do it again.....  It will be soon; I assure you it will.  Here are a few of the reasons why In-N-Out gets a solid for stars from me. -There are no microwaves; heat lamps or freezers -They use additive; preservative and filler free beef -The fries are fresh cut all day long -The shakes are made from real ice cream -This is a private; family owned company; with no plans to go public or franchise -The employees smile and make you feel like your business is appreciated.    It is always packed; so be prepared to wait a few minutes.  If you like crispy fries; be sure to order them well done.  If you don't eat meat; order a grilled cheese (prepared on meat-free cooking surface).  Learn the secret In-N-Out lingo; or just order your burger animal style...,1

God forbid I ever move somewhere where they don't have In N Out.,1

Their food is always fresh and always prepared exactly the way you want it. I love that every employee you interact is incredibly friendly and repeats the order back to you to make certain they have it correctly.  The lines can be long; but they are always worth it. Even though their patties have shrunk a little over the years; the Double Double is perfect if you need that big meat fix.""",1

I've seen the \secret\"" menu.  I've thought about what I would order.  What I did end up ordering (and eating poolside) was a double-double; animal style; with fries and a strawberry shake.  Was it messy?  Yes. Were the fries outstanding?  No; they were just A-OK Was the shake the best ever?  No; in my opinion; Portillo's has a better strawberry shake.  A-OK  But the burger?

Pizzeria Bianco like waits to pungle up your $5 for a burger; fries and coke...whiskey tango foxtrot!

They do not franchise and they do not open a store more than 1 days drive from their warehouses in LA. They make certain that the ingredients are fresh (no frozen beef) and quality standards are equally high throughout the chain.  * Is it in how they treat their employees? Everything I hear is that In-n-Out is the best fast food chain to work for; consistently paying more than MickieD's; Wendy's and the rest.  I think it's the combination of all those things...  What I do know is that they never get my order wrong; the people at In-n-Out are always happy to see me and friendly to me and the burgers and fries are always the best of any fast food chain (OK; not the best drive through burger in town...and you know who you are Lucky Boy:)   So when the \""In-n-Out urge\"" strikes; swing through In-n-Out Burger and get yourself a 3x3; mustard grilled; extra toast; a side of fries well done; and an extra large shake...

X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,UNSANITARY  Normally In-N-Out is great.  When my wife and I visited this location on 2-9-13. We had to leave halfway through the order! While I was deciding what to order; a worker wearing gloves brought out a tray of food to a customer's table and then she came over to the register and started taking our order. Halfway thru the order; another girl came and took over to finish typing it into the register. The girl that had been touching dirty plastic trays and typing on the dirty register then went back and started assembling a hamburger for someone while wearing the same gloves. I don't have OCD but I can't stand it when a worker is wearing gloves to prepare food and then touching other things (register keypads; serving trays). Why even wear gloves at all?,0
X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,I'm always looking for a Celiac friendly spot and In 'N' Out is a Go-To. They provide the alternatives my son and I need without sacrificing flavor and my cravings!

yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,Look no further    Looking for a healthy salad at a fast food establishment can be challenging  to say the least.  After all most fast food restaurants aren't know for their great tasting salads.  With that in mind I decided to give Wendy's a try.  I gave the menu a quick look over and decided to order the Apple Pecan Chicken Salad.    After the first bite I was convinced  Wendy's is pulling away from the fast food salad pack by offering flavorful salad options.  The Apple Pecan Chicken Salad is a mix of greens (Iceberg; Romaine; and Spring) with blue cheese crumbles; dried cranberries; candied pecans; apple chunks; and grilled chicken pieces with a raspberry vinaigrette. I enjoyed the taste of the sweet apples; sugared pecans; cranberries and chicken. I am not a fan blue cheese crumbles  so I asked to keep that off. All the mixtures of taste and flavor came  together and allowed for a surprisingly  light and very tasteful salad.    I have returned back for the  Apple Pecan Chicken Salad--fresh; plenty of flavor; and just six bucks.  How can you beat that. I'll keep coming back.,0
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,Gotta love that value menu they got. $.99 Fries; $.99 frosty; a chicken Caesar wrap or two for $1.30(ish)/each. They do a good job of making sure the price is great; food is above average; the building is good; and customer service is good. I think they do a fabulous job at staying abreast of all these things simultaneously and think it doesn't get any better than that on the whole. Very cheap for above average fast food; which isn't very common.,1
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,"This place tops my chart as the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. Having just been released from the hospital and given the okay to eat whatever I wanted; I fast tracked it to the nearest fast food joint I could find to grab a quick meal.   I was initially greeted with; \What do you want?\"" I brushed this aside despite it being overly rude and attempted to order food for my family. I say \""attempted\"" because; for the first time in my life; I didn't make it past the drive-thru speaker.   While ordering; the lady taking my order began speaking with another employee about prices. About 15 seconds of this went on before she returned to speaking with me.   Having just waited for her to have a conversation that could've waited the 15 seconds it would have taken me to place my order; she begins speaking to me in a rushed manner. \""Do you want your combo 'this style; this style; or this style'? Size? What to drink?\"" Not only was this the icing on the cake for me; but I looked at my fiance to make sure that I wasn't in the wrong. Her look was also that of disbelief. I calmly told the lady that she was being \""f***ing rude\"" and left for what turned out to be a Burger King down the road. Despite the BK's slower than usual service; it was 10x better than what I received at this place.   All-in-all: This place marks the first time that I was unable to make it past the ordering phase at any fast food location. Considering the bad service I have received elsewhere; this place makes its way to the top of the list for worst overall. I will never return to this place.""",0

yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,Went here tonight and we had the cod sandwich. I thought it was very good and one of the better fast food fish sandwiches. This location was very clean inside and the service was very friendly. Nice place!,1
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,I eat at this Wendys literally at least 4 times a week.  I have had a couple days of slow service but the food has always been fresh and warm.  As far as fast food goes I do not believe it gets any better than this.,0
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,I work right next to this Wendy's; which is why I continue to go back even after they mess my order up time and again.   I am a very patient man; but oh my god.    The level of ineptitude in this place is extraordinary.   I think they may actually train the employees to be horrible at their jobs.   If I were the owner of this franchise I would be furious with the way it's run.      The last 5 times I've been there they messed up my order.    They're batting 100 percent.    Haha!  For some reason I just can't resist the chipotle chicken sandwich no matter how they manage to mess it up.       Awesome sandwich; horrible employees.    I only have one word for the management there.    Training!,0
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,I've come here for lunch on and off for the past few months I've been working at my new job.  This place isn't half bad; and its just like any other wendys I've been to.  Lunch hour is busy in the resturant and the drive through; so come prepared and expect some delays when ordering.  They also serve breakfast here; and I've never had a bad experience yet!  In and out in no time!,1
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,I went to this location after picking up a friend from work; because she was hungry; and it was on the way home. The wait in the drive thru; was fairly short; and about the only good thing about this location. But when I got to the window the girl in the window; ruined the whole experience; she was quite rude; and did not appear to speak very much English.   She failed to give us one of our drinks we had ordered and paid for; and had to ask for it. She also did not give us any straws; which we did not notice till after we left the drive thru. We also ordered a 5 piece chicken nugget; and asked for barbecue sauce. The girl said that Wendy's only carried one type of sauce; honey mustard; and that is all we could have. In general this experience was horrible; the burger I got in the Baconator combo was crushed; the fries were old and stale tasting and the 5 piece chicken nuggets were old and dry.   I feel that it was toward the end of the night on a Sunday and this employee was not happy to be there and also I think they gave us old food; that was pre-made and had been sitting for a while. Either that or she was poorly trained; I am sure the language barrier had something to do with it too!,0
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,OK; So I went back to this location for my FREE meal; well there was no problem with getting the free meal; except that the girl at the counter that rang it up must have been stoned; because in between punching in my order which was pretty simple because it was on a receipt right in front of her and her singing a Brittany Spears tune; it took her like almost 10 minutes to ring it up; while I am standing there forgot to give me cups for my drinks; which I had to ask her for; and in general the food once again was crap; the fries were dry and hard; the nuggets tasted OK; and the burger was once again crushed. I use to like Wendy's I guess this what you must come to expect from today's fast food business.,0
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,This location is located in the classy around the area of the Camelback Colonnade area. With many fast food options and restaurants in the area this Wendy's location has seemed to do very well. The interior is updated and the location is always clean. The service is fast; friendly and a great bang for the buck. I think Wendy's has probably one of the best breakfast as far as options and quality food. The only issue I have with this location is my orders are not always up to par. My food thru the drive thru only has been served cold or prepared wrong. Meaning if I ask for no sauce they will still add the sauce. It happens all the time. Other then that everything else is all good.,0

yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,Quick and friendly service.  It's a Wendy's ... my toddler loves their chicken nuggets ... get me in and out without screwing up the order and I'm good.,1
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,Quick and friendly service.  It's a Wendy's ... my toddler loves their chicken nuggets ... get me in and out without screwing up the order and I'm good.,1
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,Evertime I go to this Wendy's my order is wrong. I have to repeat myself mutiple times and it is still wrong. The drive thru cashiers obviously aren't familiar with their menu when I'm reading off the sign and they are clueless; or it may be that they struggle with English. Either way; I will be going to McDonald's from now on.,0
yyuy1kimJHK2RsizjvgUNQ,This is by far the worst fast food restaurant in town. Don't get me wrong. The food is decent. But the establishment is ridiculous! The drive thru lines are outrageously slow & long. The people at the window are RUDE and not helpful at all. And God forbid you need a condiment with your meal. They won't ask you if you want one and get irritated when you do ask. It's just as bad on the inside. Slow lines. I purposely won't come here just because of their terrible service and EXPENSIVE prices!!!,0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,This place has good food; great service;  it is friendly and clean.  All of the Chipotle's that I have eaten at have been very good; except for one in downtown Washington DC where a group of kids ran through the dining room chased by police officers.  They trashed the place; and spilled a perfume display that one of the kids was trying to sell.  Which may have been why the police were chasing them I don't know.  What I do know is the perfume smelled terrible.  Anyway back to Chandler.  The good thing about Chipotle is the menu.  It is very simple.  Basically you walk up to the counter and tell the nice person what you want to eat.  All the food is displayed in front of you.  You can mix and match it any way you like.  Tacos; burritos;   even melted cheese things that aren't on the menu but kids seem to love them.    There are a few different kinds of meat.  Carnetias or braised pork; grilled chicken; and two different kinds of beef.  One grilled the other BBQed.  Fresh green peppers and onions lightly seasoned and sauteed but still crispy.  Two kinds of beans; pinto and black.  The servers are quick to tell you that the pinto beans are not for strict vegetarians or the kosher crowd.    Rice seasoned with a little cilantro that is very tasty; and last but not least delicious guacamole.  As your meal (usually a burrito for me) is assembled it moves down the counter to the salsa section.  There are a few different kinds of salsa.  A spicy red one; I don't know what is in it but it is my favorite.  A tomato; onion; cilantro mild one.  Corn relish that goes in my burrito too; and a green one that I never tired.  Then some sour cream and cheese and they magically roll it and wrap it in a tin foil sleeve.    With really good food places it is the little things that can make or break them.  For example sour cream.  Pretty basic stuff right.  At Chipolte it is delectable.  I can't find sour cream near as good at any grocery store.  The tortillas are big and seem to stretch enough to wrap whatever they put in the burrito.  Did I mention that these burritos are really big?  If you don't want to go the tortilla route they will make your burrito in a bowl.  Same stuff just no tortilla.  I once ate at the Chipolte in Lawrence Kansas with a friend.  She ate two burritos.  She is a freak; don't try it you may explode.    They seem to be proud of their chips.  Most places offer them free of charge.  Chipolte charges for them.  They could be good I've never had them; but lot's of folks order them.      No doubt about it this is fast food.  I stopped by last Tuesday at noon.  Just before I walked in 14 giggling high school kids ran up in front of me.  The line was to the door.  Ten minutes later I was at the counter watching my burrito grow.  Amazing.  Just because it is fast food doesn't mean it has to taste bland or be cold.     This place is not cheap.  Eight and a half bucks for a burrito and a small drink.  I'll keep looking for a better burrito.  Till I find one Chipotle sets the bar.,1

Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Trying hard to be a LA street food truck.   First if you plan on going allot for a 20-30 minute wait. The seats in front of the ordering counter; side and front of the restaurant are shaped like a giant curve. They must have anticipated that their customers were going to have an extended wait. The portions are big (and according to the calorie guide on the menu high in calories) but the prices are higher than most other places.   My one big complaint is; as opposed to the LA street food carts they seem to be trying to emulate; they need to have salsa/pico Di Gallo/ --- to scoop from so the immense burritos they serve can get a scoop of your favorite dressing with every few bites. Without that they are not terribly dry but could be much better. Really if they had a fixin's bar like other similar Mexican places I would rate them a 4 star place. Faster service and a 10% reduction in price would get a 5 star review.,0

Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,The food always speaks for itself...awesome! But I was much more impressed by the customer service. I am Gluten-Free; and made a request for a large order to be gluten free...during the dinner-time rush hour. The line of about 4 people behind me grew to about 50 people; but the Chipotle crew ensured my gluten-free meal by exchanging all utensils and doing everything else they could to make sure that none of my food came in contact with anything that could have had prior contact with gluten. Despite my order taking about 15 minutes to be completed (because securing a gluten free environment in a restaurant can be pain-stakeningly difficult); the whole crew had nothing but smiles and kindness toward me. I was very impressed and think that all of them definitely deserve raises for such great customer service. Give your business to people who are happy to give good service!,1

Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Found another fast lunch time place I can add to my list; and I secretly have to admit I am a fan of Chipotle; my gawd have you had there guacamole? I can't get enough of it! You can get a bag of chips & a side of guacamole for like 2 bucks; and that right there is a bangin deal and an excellent eat!   Went with some coworkers at high noon; the place had a lil line going; but I can safely say that even though there was many in front of me; the line moved in a fast fashion; and when I made it to order my food I saw the line was just as long; but I got the feeling of being rushed by the servers; like you know how at some places when they are busy they half ask you what you want and you tell them and  1/2 way though it they are messing up because they are already asking the next person what they want?  No I don't get that feeling here; I told the guy what I wanted and he made it happened and didn't take his attention away from me before he made sure I was on track with my order; then he helped the next person.   I like that; the non-feeling of being rushed!  For this trip I ordered the chicken bowl with white rice; black beans; pico de gallo; cheese and sour cream ; I also asked for a side of their hot sauce;  the chicken bowl was just what I was craving!,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Ah burrito bowls. You can pick your meat; your salsa; your veggies and your cheese. Load it up how you want it. Is it authentic Mexican? No; but who cares. It's good and possibly healthy. But the main point is it's good. The line always moves pretty good. Although it can get loud in there so you might have to yell your choices. It is a little pricey but so much better the dollar burritos from some other place so it is worth it. Good for lunch or dinner. So get some steak or carnitas and enjoy. Extra point because they have Coke Zero on tap. Every place gets an extra point if they have Coke Zero on tap. Also if you order on line you just walk in; skip the line; pay and you are on your way.,0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,First off - it's Chipotle... super good grub - nuff said.  With this particular Chipotle; which is closest to my house; I was greeted with thanks and a few questions about my experience using their new ordering system.   Which one is that?  The new Chipotle iPhone app!  App is obviously in the itunes app store and free.  Open it up; finds the closest location to you and has the whole menu to where you can build your order and submit it to them and if you'd like even pay right online with your iphone....  SWEEEET...   So downloaded the app; ordered and drove down there to meet a buddy and walked to the front of the line and grabbed my burro; paid (because I was lame and closed the app before I could enter my visa) and the guys were all making sure the app and ordering process were to my liking.  While eating the guy asking everybody how the food was made his way over to me and asked me a few questions about the process.  Either way good experience and I will be using their iPhone ordering again in the future... order was correct as ordered and simple as pie.,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Food was pretty good; as usual. I ordered the hard shell tacos and 1 taco was lopsided and everything fell out; the shell should never have been used.  Other than that; the ambiance was irritating. Obviously catering to the teenage crowd; since the blaring music made it impossible to have a conversation. Apparently there was not a manager (or adult manager) on site. I won't be back.,0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,This place is hit or miss. I've had good service; mediocre service; and just bad service. Tonight was pretty bad. I ordered 3 things; a bowl; a burrito; and a cheese quesadilla. I asked for just a little rice in the burrito; they put in a ton; when I said it was too much I got a crazy look from the person making my food. Whatever; I can get over that. What put me over the edge; was they got my daughter's order wrong; and this after waiting too long for it; (this was a to go order; couldn't just bring it back) . I ordered her a cheese quesadilla. I got chicken; ya I know seems silly right; but my daughter is 5; she is like every 5 year old.... Picky! She was a good sport and tried to eat it; but evidently ended up picking out the chicken. The 3 stars are for the food;  taste is consistent as usual.... If it were just based on the service tonight ; this would be a 1 star review.,0

Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Super fast services; awesome!!!,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,This Chipotle Rocks!   Today; I express my joy In the haiku form!  Perfect fast food joint; Fresh; delicious; quick and kind. The price is right; too!  Burritos galore; In a tortilla or bowl. But wait; there is more!  Three steak tacos; please! Or grilled veggie fajitas? Oh sweet perfection.  A simple menu; Yet so many decisions. How can you go wrong?  Answer:  You cannot!   Order now; you won't regret; This Chipotle Rocks!,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,I used to be afraid of foil wrapped burritos after a painful experience a few years ago.  So; I would usually get the crispy tacos here or if I did order a burrito I would perform an airport-security like check of all the folds and creases after removing the foil.  Now that I have had all my old metal fillings replaced I can eat their burritos without having a mild anxiety attack but I still prefer the tacos for lunch because of the smaller portion size.  Either way it's darn good fast food.  If you were born after 1980; you probably have no idea what I am talking about.,0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,I am not sure what ails this particular branch; but quality is bad and portion size is comparably smaller. I only order for either a veggie bowl or a chicken bowl. More often than not the rice turns out undercooked and the chicken is dry. Even if I am paying for an extra helping of chicken or guacamole; the serving size is always less. I have been to other places and never felt disappointed the way I feel at this particular branch.,0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,I haven't had Chipotle in a while; and suddenly found myself inside here waiting in a very long line to place my order.  It's been a while since I've eaten here; so I figured it was time!  When I entered; it was the dinner rush; so there was a very long line.  Ahead of me were 4 Phoenix fireman; along with a UPS driver.  Nice!   Despite the line being painfully long; I placed my order.  I got the Fajita burrito with the shredded beef.  Tasty!    I do have to give a kudos to the staff here.  Clearly; they were extremely busy; and despite that; I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me; as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.    I also really like how thier menu's set up.  Fairly simple; with nice choices to choose from.  Not to complicated; easy to understand and a fair price point.  Really enjoyed my time here; and the staff was wonderful. Will return in the future!,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Have been coming here since they opened.  The last six months or so something has changed.  The quality of the food and service has suffered.  One time I was meeting a friend for lunch and had to call the manager out to the dining area because the music was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.  Another two times the rice was under cooked.  Portion size is way down.  Employees back talk you when you ask to have a kids meal made a particular way due to a finicky eating child.  I think I'll start driving out to the Chandler mall location.,0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,"Hola!  Just a quikie note. stopped in 4 our 10;000th burrito (or so it seems); and once again; great food great service.   I have decided to update my reviews with a couple of new catagories. One will not change. this one I call \curb appeal\"" (this is how the establishment make me want to be there upon arrival;and how clean the entryway is) it will be rated 1 to 10; 10 being the best. And \""the P factor\"" (this one is where I rate how the bathroom looked; as it is important for me to see a clean restroom. I take this as a sign that the rest of the place is clean. The two together work in combination and show me how clean the restaurant is. Even in open concept things can be decieving.  So that being said todays ratings are  curbage: 9  P factor: 9  Great job as always chipotle!  Late   gordo""",1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,"Oh my god...   I used to hate Chipotle. HATE! Hate. When asked why; I said; \Because they offer rice burritos to vegetarians.\"" I thought the burritos were 90 percent rice; 10 percent goodness; even when I asked for light rice.   I was; as it turns out; save-ably stupid. Because redemption is mine every time I eat here.   They get it. They \""Get It\"" get it. They GET IT with a capital GET IT.   Oh; I shall explain. Worry ye not...   I want the world to stop eating meat. In fact; it is my destiny; my very purpose; to rid the world of Fear (i.e.; meat). It's true; all you're eating when you're eating meat is fear. 98 percent of you will have no idea what I mean when I say that but I can promise you it's true.   But I don't want Chipotle to stop serving meat because people like you would stop going there and it'd go out of business and I would die because there would be nothing left for me to eat; because lately; it's all I eat. Yes. I ate twice today. Both times; Chipotle. If I lose weight; I'll become the next Jared. Gain. Ignominy. Whatevs...  It's delicious.  So here's what they get:   The freshest ingredients.  The meat; if you care; is straight up not injected with growth hormones or bull shit.   Portions are huge. Almost too big.   But the technology OOOOOHHHHHHH the technology!   Like Chuck R said... YOU CAN ORDER ON YOUR iPhone! It's ridiculous.  And our office orders as an office. ONLINE! Individually! Again; ridiculous! We can order exactly what we want; pay separately. The orders are prepared with love. They'll bring it out to your car. They'll even occasionally call you to make sure everything was amazing.   It was! It always is. I love you. Smooch.""",0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,"Oh Chipotle; what's not to love honestly?  Great quality ingredients that you can have thrown together in a completely customizable meal; it's hard to go wrong with that set up.  I managed to stop in at a rare time when they didn't have a huge line and made my way up to the counter.  The people behind the counter greeted me with a smile and a \hello\"" right away; and proceeded right away to get my order taken care of.  The girl who rang me up was very friendly too and even put a smiley face on my container!  Call me a sucker for the small stuff but I love things like that!""",1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Well it was bound to happen... yes; here is my review on Chipotle. I am not a huge fan to be honest. However; I am going to be optimistic and at least mention what the best thing on their menu is.  For the longest time; I honestly hated Chipotle and couldn't put my finger on what it was that I disliked. Then I finally hit the nail on the head. Its the meat! I have tried all of their meats and all have sucked honestly. The steak and chicken are tough; don't have much flavor; and tend to have pieces with grissle. Barbeqoa is wayyy too fricken salty. Carnita's are probably the lesser of the evils but is wayyyyy to peppery. If it weren't for the hubby being a huge fan of the carnita's and guac here; I would have never gone back. But since he loves Chipotle so much and requests it once a month; I had to find something to order that is decent.  After trying tacos; salads; quesadillas; my go to meal turned out to be the vegi burro. Please don't give this review that look. Its actually good and it comes with the guacamole! Yes; I love meat and rarely order something vegetarian. However; Chipotle is the one place I prefer something vegetarian over something with meat because like I said; the meat is soooo horrible. Now when I am forced to go to Chipotle; I get a burrito with rice (I order extra); black beans; corn salsa; hot salsa; pico de gallo; extra sour cream; and guac on the side. These are the best items Chipotle has. I have to admit; their rice is actually tasty; their tortillas are soft and huge; the corn salsa is downright delicious (but who doesnt like corn); and their pico is always fresh with a pretty good flavor. Betcha noticed that I make no mention of cheese huh? Don't get me wrong; I love cheese but Chipotles cheese seems too strong for my taste. Anyways; let me sum up the food by saying that although you get alot; nothing accept the veggie burro is acceptable in my book. Even this vegi burrito is simply ok and tolerable; once in a decade craveable.  Now as for the service; some of the locations seem to hire people that lack intelligence and this location is no exception to that. Many times; there seems to be too many people behind the counter running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Also; the burritos tend to have holes in them because the roller doesn't know how to roll.  I will say that I am absolutely puzzled as to why Chipotle has such a huge following. To me; its far from being sensational. Luckily; I have found something decent to order but this is not a place that I get really excited about. About the only time I got stoked to see a Chipotle was in NY after eating multiple overpriced downright depressing meals. Maybe I was just looking for something familiar after being away from home for a week. However; when other Chipotle cravings emerge; I satisfy them and then head to the drug store to get a certain test because obviously somethin aint right!,0

Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,I love the food; but I've had it with online ordering; which is why I'm not giving them 4 or 5 stars. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!!  This is the 5th time they screw up mine and my friends' order. My friend Pre ordered his Steak Bowl from Chipotle this location on 54th street. Which always has a line out the door.   Order: White Rice; Steak; Blk Beans; Pinto Beans; Veggies; Medium Salsa and Cheese (simple)  What he got: Brown rice; Blk Beans; Medium Salsa.  As it was a to-go; we did not notice this until after we got back to the office.,0
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Quick awesome food and service as usual. Live this place!,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,I can go to Chipotle anywhere and it will always be good! Since I am vegan; I love going to this place and eating my heart out. Love the organic foods and love the vegan option! Awesome service like all the other Chipotles I have been to.,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,This is one of my regular fast food joints - fast food that is actually good for you.  I always enjoy the chicken burrito with black beans; cheese; medium salsa; sour cream and lettuce.  My wife enjoys having her burrito in a bowl not wrapped in a tortilla.  This is a national chain; but they do a good job of keeping the ingredients fresh.  The service is quick; as the counter people pass your food down an assembly line; adding the burrito stuffings right in front of you; then passing it on to you after prompt payment - cash; debit/credit cards accepted.  They have the usual fountain drinks; ice tea; beer and wine  Quick; easy and tasty.,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,I never used to like Chipotle - pretty much the same way I never used to like gyro's; but now I can't get enough!  I don't go for the overstuffed burritos - the cleaner and easier to eat burrito bowl is the way to go.  I always get double steak; rice; pinto beans; and the medium tomatillo salsa - best...combo...ever!  I guess I should branch out and try new things on the menu; but I ALWAYS order the same thing from every place I frequent.  Ok - next time I'll try something other than the chicken - since it's super bland.  The staff are always super helpful - even got a little tip from the cashier once.  If the line is long (as it always is); just step outside; place a phone order; then hop around the line to go pick up your called in order; because she said they make it nearly immediately. ahahah  I've made an order with my iPhone twice now; and it couldn't be easier.  The only reason this place got 4 stars was because even though the steak is awesome most of the time; from time to time it's kinda tough - it could be that much better if the meat was a little bit better quality.  Also - the chicken is always dry and lacks flavor.,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,"Chipotle is the best business model of the 21st Century; and this location wholly embodies the Chipotle perfection.  Chipotle uses naturally raised meats; hormone free dairy; no eggs or nuts; organic beans; seasonal produce; and promote recycling within the restaurants. This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)  Their simple menu makes ordering easy; but still allows you variety (Burrito; Salad; Tacos; Bowls) and caters to a carnivore; vegetarian; or vegan.

Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute; because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:  I run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around; my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous; but believe me; it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering.   Anyway; I go online; login; and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order; the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures; places for memos; etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.  Once everyone has ordered; I hit submit; pay by credit card; and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle; give them a jingle; and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the \""valet\"" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!  Chipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well; delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)  I want to take a second to recognize this particular location; on 54th Street. Let me start by saying; I believe that you can taste the love in food... as in; if someone is cranky as shit; making your food; it is not as good as if they are smiling; enjoying their lives. I know this probably sounds crazy; but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE!   Oh; and about two hours after pickup; someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award; this location deserves it!  My final note: I get the salad with black beans; rice; tomato salsa; green tomatillo salsa; and guacamole. 100% vegan; 100% delicious. Under 500 calories; 17g of fat; and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full.   Since I have started eating Chipotle 3-4 times a week; I have actually started losing weight.

Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,"The only reason I go to this location is strictly out of convenience; but after today I will inconvenience myself to drive to another location. The ONLY reason we went to this location today was because we decided at the last minute to get Chipotle; now I wish we went to the location off Rural and Baseline I believe.   First off the place was a hot mess today. Food ALL OVER the floor in the dining area. Yes there were kids there and I know they can be messy but WOW food; rice and paper(yes I said paper; did not know that paper was on the menu; must be new) was all over the floor. Ya know I don't expect places to be completely spotless by any means but at the same time it's just not appealing to see stuff all over the place.   Second; the customer service or should I say lack of customer service. If I wanted attitude and nasty looks by the employees I'd go to the MVD because you know everyone there hates their job and has no issue sharing/displaying that to others. The first guy in the food was just gave me a look of \yeah lady I know what the \""f\"" I'm doing\"" with slight attitude; I move along and get my carnitas; beans and rice slightly annoyed. THEN comes the guy that puts the salsa; cheese sour cream and whatever  else you might want. Once again I get the same look as the last guy; just a little more dominant accompanied by MORE attitude. This guy also decides to OBVIOUSLY completely miss my taco with the sour cream and put in in between the two. Thank you guy; I really didn't want it on my taco; I like to eat it by itself. At this point I just want to get my food and leave.   Third; I will have to say that this trip was better than the last. The last one; my boyfriend had to practically hold me back from completely lashing out at the VERY incompetent employee behind the counter. My order REALLY isn't that difficult and I really don't understand why it was sooo hard to comprehend. I always get the three tacos on corn with carnitas; pinto beans; white rice; corn salsa(extra); sour cream(extra) and cheese(extra)(I have to get extra because they never want to put an actual decent amount of any of those three on the food). The only thing I ask to be different is to place the tacos in the bowl instead of the foil because I don't want to EAT foil. Anyways; the first guy that was making my order just simply could not for the life of him understand what I was asking and on top of that was VERY VERY nasty/mean to me. Worse than a three year old throwing a tantrum. It was absolutely awful including the taste of the food!! I ended up throwing it away after just a couple of bites!!   Last but not least; I have worked in the customer service for about 15 years now in one way or another. I know what it's like to have difficult; mean; unruly and just downright mean people. I also know not to take it personally and just bite my tongue because arguing with the customer is just adding fuel to the fire and will just not go anywhere for me or the customer. After all that being said; the way we were treated and the way horrible way the food was prepared; there is not anything(and I mean nothing) in this world that will ever bring me back to this location.   Fool me once; shame on you; fool me twice; shame on me; fool me thrice; yeah...No not gonna happen! All in all this location is horrible; rude and messy. People have asked me where the nearest Chipotle is and I only tell them about the location on Rural; there is NO reason I should tell them about this one. Thank you for reading/listening to my rant.""",0

Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Pretty sure most people have eaten at a Chipotle at some point .  So this review is for location instead of the food; which is pretty consistently good if you want burritos and guacamole.  This location is close so I go quite a bit. It tends to have long lines at odd times for no reason; and the parking is pretty terrible.  I would suggest parking outside of the little lot area it shares with the other stores.  The staff is always nice and friendly.  Although now the online ordering makes you wait even if there is no one in line.  So you should use that over just showing up since standing there now means very little.,1
Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,"For fast-food Mexican it's hard to go wrong with Chipotle's! I recommend the Burrito Bol; which if you order without rice is a good \low carb\"" option. The barbacoa is great; especially when paired with the spicy salsa. If you're interested; pairing this with the Negro Modelo makes for an enjoyable combination.""",0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,Used to go there frequently when it was Filibertos but lately the service and food has gone down significantly. I ordered super nachos with no meat and when I got hot it had meat all over it. I called and no o e spoke English and couldn't understand my frustration. I also asked for extra red hot sauce and they wanted to charge me .50 even though there's a salsa bar inside. I will never go back to this location and in fact I hopenit just closes down as it is an eye sore to the area.,0

mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,They try to charge you .50 cents through the drive through for extra hot sauce but there's a salsa bar inside. They also mess up orders frequently.,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,I like this place sober.  Most people go to restaurants like this when they are full of booze.  I have never had a bad or off meal here and the service is fast and friendly.  My favorites are the rolled tacos; bean burrito with cheese; or if I am really feeling decadent - the carne asada fries.  Also; it is important to note that their beans taste like beans my Grandma would have made.  There is no Pinesol aftertaste in the food.  Do you know what I mean?,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,"Mexican fast food... being from New York and then Miami this was pretty new to me (outside of taco bell; which brings great shame to the term \mexican\"" or \""border\""). So at about 2 a.m. with some large amounts of alcohol in my system; I decided to try it. The tacos were pretty good; especially at that point in the evening. Food was fast as the name would suggest; and cant beat it for a late night meal.""",0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,Not fair. A co-worker turned me on to the carne asada burrito and I can't bring myself to order anything else here.   Beef. Guacamole. Pico de Gallo. Wrapped in a flour tortilla. With green & red hot sauce on the side. Get the fock outta here.,1
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,I have had many a cheeseburger in my day; but let me exclaim that Shake Shack is THE BEST EVER!!!! Went there after a show for a quick bite. I ordered one and ended up eating 3! I don't remember the details about the fries and shakes; but the burgers OUTSTANDING!!!!,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,Being one of the million blank-oberto's in this town; this one is not all that bad.  I really don't like these places; but was at the bank across the street on a Saturday; had my 7 & 8 year olds with me running errands and it was getting to be around 1pm; needed lunch to be quick; easy and something they'd eat.  Between the three of us we had some pretty good quesadillas; a few tacos which were fully loaded and not 90% lettuce; and some carne asada.    The food was all hot and the taco shells were really very good.   Was not asked to pay extra for the salsa bar OR for drink refills (even though the menu says there is a charge)  My only complaints are: 1.  How the reviewer concluded the food here is not greasy I will never understand..it was all greasy.  This is to be expected at this kind of place; but it was a bit over the top  2.  The blaring hispanic channel soap opera on the two tv's.  As much as I didn't want to eat inside we were a distance from home and I had no choice.  Again this is to be expected.  3.  60 cent charge to use my debit card?  On a $17 order?  Really??  Almost got them a 3-star for that one!,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,Ordered a bean and cheese burrito at like 11:30pm. Sometimes you just gotta give in... and this time; there were no regrets.   I did request rice to be in there; too; but I think the drive thru sound system is funky since she had a hard time hearing us... and I didn't get my rice; but it wasn't on my receipt either. Oh well.   Pretty solid.,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,What's worse than greasy Mexican food? COLD Greasy Mexican food!  I ordered the super nachos which were slathered in cold beans and unmelted cheese. Gross! My man ordered the cheese enchilada; which was also cold and full of unmelted cheese. In general; the food was cold and not satisfying. We would have given them 2 to 3 stars; since they have a salsa bar and lots of cheap combo plates. But the a/c was broken; making our dining experience even more unpleasant. Heck the restaurant was hotter than the food!  Pass it up; folks.,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,This review pertains to carnitas; and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos; rice; beans; horchata. That's about it! Yum!,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,I am a huge fan of Julio's! Their menu alone puts Taco Bell and DelTaco to shame. With a wide variety of items to choose from; including dishes with shrimp and fish; it is hard to NOT to find something to eat. What I love most about this place is that it is open 24 hours. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and has even cut me some slack on occasions when I placed the wrong order--they were kind and even made me an entire new plate. Also; the portions are quite large; I often can split a meal with a friend if we're not super hungry. You can also dine in at Julio's. They have a clean inside environment with plenty of booths and tables.  I recommend the Chimichanga--chicken or steak; or the Carne Asada burritos.,0
mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,They have $1 tacos Mon - Wed. Otherwise; I wouldn't go here. It's like the million other -berto's - very greasy; moderately priced and no customer service should be expected. When you need a late night/early morning snack or are just craving super greasy Mexican food; this is your place.,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Not a big burger fan but this place is close to my work and I just needed to pick up something real quick one day so decided to check it out. I must say I was pretty impressed. The steak burgers are sooo tasty and they look homemade not your typical commercial patty. I went back and took a chance with the hot dog and it was good too. I love the grilled onion they put on it.  I am not big on sweets but decided to try their frozen custard one time and I must say it was pretty damn good. Better than any ice cream I have ever tasted. I like the texture and consistency... It is very creamy and not too sweet.  Oh and their fries... Can't get enough of them... I get them extra crispy and the seasoning they use it awesome. It's not just salt...  Definitely a good place if you need a burger fix. I always use the drive through but the service is decent. Nothing special for a drive through. They have never got my order wrong.,1

It has a retro-diner kind of feel; with black and white patterned tile and red vinyl seats; but it's fast food so you can order at the counter or through the drive-thru.  I haven't had their \famous\"" steak burger; but their veggie burger is delicious.  It comes piled high with toppings and accompanied by skinny seasoned fries (if you get the combo).  Their frozen custard is wonderful as well; and they have a huge variety of mix-ins to choose from.  I got toasted coconut!  Mmmmm!  5 stars easy!""",0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,I adore their burgers. It's the frilly; crispy edges they have - lacey bits of beefy goodness! Their seasoned shoestring fries are fantastic too; if you happen to get a fresh batch.   I'm only dinging them a couple of stars because service can be slow; and their frozen custard is just OK. Admittedly; I was spoiled by a fantastic small custard shop in my old East coast neighborhood. *sigh*,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This place is great for good at a good price. You can get a combo meal for about $6. Their burgers are made from sirloin burger and extremely good. I usually get the patty melt.  The rye bread is butter toasted and so stinkin' good!  They're small patties; so it's a good idea to order a double. The onion rings are the best I've had at a fast food restaurant.   The custard is so creamy and rich. They can make basically anything you like; but plain vanilla is pretty tasty.  The service is also outstanding. If you dine in; a manager will walk by and ask how everything was. Excellent customer service.,1

cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,"\I tried this place again and the food was and services was very good. Glad I did!\""""",1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This place is insanely good.  WHY ARE THERE NO CUSTARD BURGER JOINTS IN L.A.???  The original Freddy's special with everything on it and fries hits the spot every single time.    The service here is some of the most energetic and friendly that I've ever come across; too.  I mean; yesterday the owner himself was going around talking to people; making sure they were content.  You don't find that every day.,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,We ordered the single cheeseburger; double patty melt; Hawaiian; and peanut butter cup with banana sundaes.  Sandwiches were very tasty and flavorful. The fries were cooked to the perfect crisp; and the custards were delicious and smooth. The entire staff was polite and helpful. We felt very welcomed and comfortable during our visit. Thanks for the hospitality and good food. We'll be back if we pass through this area again.,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Love this place! The hotdogs are so juicy and flavorful; the french fries are seasoned just right - you cannot go wrong with anything you order here! Highly recommended!,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Delightful frozen yoghurt at at unbeatable price - a mini sundae for three bucks and plenty for two to share. I can't rave the same about the unfriendly service though...my cashier  had  crabby pants and  had the look of a snapper turtle. Oh well...Life goes on!  Their French fries looked fantastic and YES; OUI; SI - I will be back for those...and maybe a burger also...,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,I am posting this today; but can not remember what day I went. I know it was last month; but the place stays fresh in my mind.  The food was great; the service was friendly; but they forgot to make my food! I waited about twenty minutes; but eh; not  a big deal. I was out of town for work; as I often find myself. I was in no hurry to rush back to Motel (#). Before you start to make assumptions; they really did forget to make my food. There were no orders up; and no food on the grill. I'm not sure why is happened; but when I inquired about my food it was an endless stream of apologies.  The manager gave me a business card good for a free meal. I came back the next day and ate another good meal; which was only better than the first one because it was free!  I like how the manager goes table to table asking how the meal is going. This is something you normally see at places that are more formal or fancy like Olive Garden.  The place was so clean; it was hard to believe. I wish that there was a Freddy's near my home.,1

cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,"My people; my people; my people. Freddy's is a fraud! It is a knock off of the Midwest darling Steak and Shake and they ARE famous for steakburgers! It burns my buns that they copied Steak and Shake. If you have ever had both you know what I am talking about. It's like listening to your favorite song for years; and then some idiot does a remake and screws it up!  Little info on SNS: Steak n Shake was founded in 1934 in Normal; Illinois. Gus Belt; the founder of Steak n Shake; was a quality restaurateur who owned a restaurant/gas station called Shell's Chicken. Central Illinois had plenty of chicken and beer restaurants so Gus soon realized he needed to be unique and different. With a little help from his friends; he started Steak n Shake in February of 1934.   The Steak stood for STEAKBURGER? sandwich. Gus would wait for the busiest time in his counter-only restaurant; wheel in a barrel of steaks (including round steak; sirloin steak; and T-bones) and grind the steaks into burgers right in front of the guests. Hence; the origin of the famous slogan \In Sight It Must Be Right.\""   The STEAKBURGER? sandwich is still the finest burger served anywhere in the world-the finest of steaks ground into pucks; and through the art of grilling on a very hot grill; turned into a burger beyond comparison.   Freddy copied the idea from Gus. When Steak and Shake franchised and moved east stretching from Illinois to Pennsylvania down to Florida. That is when Freddy decided to begin moving west from Kansas. At the time Steak and Shake was only as far west as St. Louis; MO. Freddy uses the same signature colors red; black and white. SNS standard steak burger comes with mustard; a slice of onion; and 2 long slices of classic dill pickle. FFC serves it the same except the bun is different and the pickle is a spicy claussen type. SNS serves skinny fries with salt. FFC serves them with seasoned salt. SNS has hand dipped shakes. FFC does custard.   Now that steak and shake is making it's advancement further west; currently Dallas is the furthest; FFC will be toast!   I have eaten at FFC; and they do make a decent steakburger. I love steakburgers and this is as close to the original as you will find west of Dallas. However having tasted the original from SNS I cannot be as excited as other yelpers about this phony. In my opinion Freddy ruins the burger with those over powering pickles and the fries are to skinny to support seasoned salt it is over powering. I am not into custard so cannot remark on that.   I like In and Out better than Freddy's but not better than Steak N Shake. Also you cannot compare a Steakburger to and In and Out Burger.   For those Steak N Shake fans out there; if you order a steak burger from Freddys; don't get the pickles and ask for regular salt on your fries.   I can't wait for Steak N Shake to make it to Phoenix; I will be camped out at the front door!""",0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,"Probably as good or better than the rest of the fast-food burgers around here.  I ordered the patty melt combo.  I like my bread with a little character; and this was pretty decent rye bread.  The burger itself; with the cheese and onions; was juicy and flavorful.  A different style from most burger places; I guess that's where the \steakburger\"" concept comes in.  The fries were tasty as well - shoestring fries; which I prefer.  I don't know why - maybe it's the fact that there's more fried surface area than normal ones; but these were just plain good.  For dessert - I have to at least try their signature dessert - I went with the turtle sundae.  The custard tasted pretty much like normal soft serve ice cream; and it was loaded with walnuts; with some chocolate and caramel topping.  Nothing really special; but it was pretty decent; probably as good as you'd get at DQ or Tastee Freez.  I'd say this is definitely a winner in the fast food market.""",0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,i have ate at freddys many times and it is usually good..the food was great today;we got there when they just opened the door at 10:30..the floors were dirty and we were the first ones in and the lady taking our order was a little cranky especially when we took more than a second to decide..then she had to correct me on my verbage on the menu..i made the mistake and called it a meal( meaning with fries and drink) i was sternly corrected and told it was a #3...lol forgive my ignorance!!! probably wont be back for a while..foods is good but not good enough to put up with attitude from staff!!,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Ok ... I have to admit; first; that I have been a HUGE fan of In N Out burger for years ... then I stopped into Freddy's one day; and haven't gone to In N Out since!  The service is great; the food is AMAZINGLY good; and the atmosphere is fun and fresh.  You will not be disappointed!  I do the California Double Combo ... give them a try!,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This was my first trip to Freddy's in probably close to a year...not because I don't like it; but my wife is a bigger fan of Culver's.  I had a meeting that evening that caused me to miss at home dinner time and decided to hit up Freddy's for my dinner.  This was my first time through the drive-thru; all other visits had been inside.  Drive-thru; even though there was a steady stream of cars; was fairly quick.    I ordered a double California Burger; with fries and a soda.  Now; I'll be honest; this was a few weeks back; and the fries and soda weren't that memorable...but the burger was fantastic.  Seemed meatier than normal (maybe that is in comparison to the usual Culver's burger?) and the taste was great.  Cooked as good as a fast-food burger can be cooked.    Oh Freddy's; I like you so; hopefully I can ditch my wife more often to dine on your delicious burgers!,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,"I wanted to like Freddy's a lot more than I did. Prob 2.5 stars; really; but I appreciate the variety on the menu; and that they're offering something a little different.  That being said; I didn't really care for what they're offering.   The menu pics make a \Steakburger\"" (quotes are quite necessary in this case!) look like thinly sliced pieces of steak/beef; kind of like a thicker unprocessed version of the glued together mass that Arby's cuts into their thin slices.  But that's not at all what it is; as there's nothing \""steak\"" about it. Imagine taking an already thin; very basic hamburger patty and smashing it down with a meat tenderizing hammer so that it tapers to a super thin edge. You know all of those little fat bubbles that usually accumulate on the top side of an unflipped burger?  In a \""Steakburger\"" all of those fat bubbles congeal together between the gound beef bits; on the grill side not the top; into a solid; slightly crispy layer of meat/fat. It's so thin that they have to offer you two patties as the basic; with options of one or three patties on the menu; too.  A normal burger does not include lettuce & tom; you pay extra for that.   My personal taste is that thicker is better for fries; as long as they're not limp; gimme steak fries every time.  I thought Freddy's Steakburger would have steak fries; but they actually have shoestring fries.  The seasoning was good; but the flavor of potato is so lost in grease and salt that it was kind of heavy on the belly quickly.  The worse part was that it was actually very annoying having to repeatedly dunk them in ketchup and move them to my mouth. I'm not usually such a lazy eater (~!~)(Stoopid Amehr-i-KAHNs) but I had to opt for a fork.  These would make nice chili fries; I guess. Didn't bother with custard. Service stank; too; as I waited about 3 minutes with no acknowledgement even though there were employees busy right in front of me  making desserts.  I guess they weren't authorized for bare-customer contact.  A drive thru guy eventually came to take the order; but as soon as he stepped up to me; he began talking to the person in the drive thru and walked away; gesturing to someone I couldn't see around the corner.  A shaggy haired dude pushing a mop bucket came into view; saying \""I'll try; but it's been a while\"" as he walked up to the register.  Guy's like 17; how long could it have been?  A manager looking guy  stepped in front of young shaggy mop amnesia fellow; a different shirt color was my only clue to his title; not skill level; that's fo' sho'.""",0

cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This 2.5 had been *generously* rounded up to a 3; but no longer....  I went to Culver's; basically.  Now I get what Freddy's is trying to be.  Although Freddy's has a mythology that  lays claim to being the originator of the burger style; Culver's just does it better.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/culvers-phoenix#hrid:yDsMVl72kItXdkeWUKHLog  They do everything better.  From friendly customer service; cleanliness; to the fresh and tasty food; and the thick yet crisp on the outside crinkle cut frys were simply a model of perfection on the delicate Greasy~Crispy Spectrum.  The basic sundae automaticaly comes with 2 flavors of topping; so they aren't trying to unfairly skrimp you for skrilla left and right with extras.  Very cool; Culver's!   Boo Freddy's for being so lackluster with customer service; overseasoned with food; and generally failing.,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This is my new go to spot when on the west side. I had the California style burger and it was really really good. The seasoning on the patty is perfect and I like that the buns are buttered and toasted. The fries were also really good and loved the fry sauce they have to dip them in. Had an oreo chocolate ice cream sandwich to top off the meal and it was the perfect ending. Restaurant was clean; reasonably priced and the service was quick and friendly. Fingers crossed they open a Scottsdale location in the future.,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This place is awesome! and would place it as one of the places I would visit if I was in the area. The steak burgers are a little thin; but pack big flavor. The fries are nice as well.   The custard is outstanding and is a must after dinner meal.  Service wise; the staff is extremely friendly and compariable to chik filets...  If your in the area I would definitely make give this place a try.,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,I thought this place would blow Culver's outta the water...but eh it's pretty much the same. I hit the drive thru & ordered the following: #1 w/onion rings & a Dr. P; another #1 but make it a single & no onions w/fries & a Dr. P & a regular sized concrete with chocolate frozen custard; cookie dough & marshmallow. They messed up & gave us 2 fries; I need to always remember to check the bag! But hubby wasn't too disappointed; the fries were really good. The burgers were good too but our food was barely warm; ugh. The frozen custard was bomb! But I think Culver's burgers & frozen custard are just as good (they do beat them in the fries category though); plus they are way closer to us; so I will just stick w/them when we're in the mood for that kind of stuff!,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,First time coming here and it was delicious. I recommend it for the whole family. The burgers were fresh and seasoned well. The chicken tenders my daughter had were tasty. The custards were amazing as well. Great place for a burger friendly service and a great meal. Can't beat that,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Excellent desserts and fries with good service  I had never seen a Freddy's until moving to Phoenix.  Turns out that it's a nice add to the list of faster food options.  While the burgers are good; they are indeed thin.  Compared to the big wad of food some places give you; it may even seem skimpy.  But; it's a welcomed change for those trying to not stuff themselves.  That said; our family is a fan of Freddy's dessert concretes/sundaes; chicken tenders; and fries .  Excellent on all; especially the PBC&C and Turtle concretes.  A bit pricier that your MickeyD or B-King; but we like it better.  They at least commit to not pre-cooking everything.  And the service is usually much nicer.,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,"I discovered Freddy's a few months ago; and it has since worked it's way into my lunch rotation since it is fairly close to where I work.  The burgers are unique compared to the norm; if not a little greasy.  The staff has always been more than friendly; especially during those early days when I wasn't quite sure what constitutes a \steakburger\"".   On every visit an employee walks by asking how our meal was and clears our trays for us; which isn't  service you don't get at many fast food joints.  Maybe one day I will leave enough room to try their famous frozen custard!""",1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Gotta love this place no matter the location.  It's a must that you get a double because patties are thin.  Order it like they serve it...stop being picky anyway!  The fries are amazing...thin shoe string fries!  Order an extra basket of fries to share with your table.  May as well order a cone to go for the ride home.  In PHX you gotta eat that fast...frozen custard to go in 110 degrees.  Love it!,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Always love eating here! Great service great food and the kids love it! Big plus in my book!,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,After working down the street from Freddy's for a year and half and wanting to go; I finally went with a coworker who raved about the place.  I ordered the # 1 combo; burger; drink and fries. The meal was just under $7.  The burger is fresh and very good and enjoyed my burger. I wouldn't say it's my favorite burger; but it's in the upper echelon especially in the Phoenix Area..   One thing that stands out is the pickles that are served on the burger. I've never had  long sliced pickles on a burger; usually just pickle chips. I wish ketchup came on the burger; but you can add this yourself.  Fries were good; could have used a little more than the small scoop I received.    I will definitely go back and maybe next time opt for a custard or sweet treat.,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,"For a \Fast Food\"" style place Freddy's really impressed me. The food was tasty; the service was friendly and fast; the only thing I can even think of nitpicking is the open tables were a bit dirty but there was an employee there to wipe it down before we could sit down.   Into the regular rotation for sure.""",1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,I went here last week or late the week prior. The food was as good as ever.  My wife tried their green chili burger and it was out of this world. The best in Phoenix!   In fact it was so good that I went there again last night with plans of ordering it. Unfortunately the promotion ended the day before and the burger was no more. I must say I was disappointed and ordered something else.   What I got was delicious but it just wasn't what I'd set my sights on. I must implore Freddy's to bring that green chili burger back or at the very least allow someone to order the toppings ala carte.    With that out of the way; the food is fantastic and the prices are well below what I'd expect.  You can't go wrong coming here for a meal.,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Fantastic place; the Double Bacon Steakburger is my favorite so far. Burgers here are very customizable to suit your taste buds. The employees are very friendly and helpful. Only received a wrong order from here one time; however it was resolved with ease; and I received a coupon for the mix up. One time I received a free sample on their caramel turtle sundae out of the blue. All in all it's a well rounded burger joint. I Highly recommend it.,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Just wanted something cold and good. Hello frozen custard! where have you been hiding? Actually used to get frozen custard on the east side with the family when I was young and it brought back so many fond memories. Great little place; fast and friendly service,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Okay...I have been here once. But I was in town visiting and heard from a few peeps that this spot was worth checking out. When we finally found it; we strolled in. Digging the old school atmosphere! Placed our order and we waited; giddy like schoolgirls. I had a patty melt; my lady friend had the PM with 'shrooms on it; and her mom had a burger. Everything looked AWESOME when it arrived. The meat is great; totally different from anything you get from any fast food joint. (Yuck). The little shoestring fries were GREAT! I usually prefer bigger fries; hell; even sometimes curly or smothered in chili; but these little guys were great. Matter of fact; I was here a little over 2 weeks ago and still haven't had fries from anywhere else. No thanks. All in our group loved their food. Next time I am in town; we are going back. Also; the worms n dirt was great as well. That frozen custard is a must-try.,0
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This is my favorite fast food style burger joint. I'd fight a (small; tired) dude for their burgers. I've tried them just about every way; but the original double with cheese is best. Onion rings are the real deal; and although I'm not a shoestring fry kind of guy; the fries are always hot; salty and tasty and are perfect for dipping by the fist full in hot sauce (*hot sauce not included).  The deserts are great too; I love their custard. The Hawaiian sundae is a must have. I know; I know; you say you don't like macadamia nuts. I'm not a big fan myself; but frozen macadamias are something completly different than their room temperature counterparts. A crunchy; nutty awesomeness that I've never tasted in anything else.  The service is always great too. One time we did have a bit of a mishap; while in the drive through our shakes came out long before our food. Which obviously meant that they had melted by the time we got home. My wife contacted the manager; who showed genuine concern and was nice enough to issue us a gift certificate of a surprisingly significant denomination; sufficient for a few trips back to the drive through.  Contrary to what Curtis Mayfield has advised; I can assure you that Freddy is most certainly NOT dead.,1
cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Nice place; great food and service.,1
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,"Dude; why have I never heard of this place before! Oh; because they don't have any in California . . . damn.   Like others have said; this is an In & Out Equivalent; but in my humble opinion; I think Whataburger is better. You get more food for the same price and better service.  And the burger tastes more \real\"" than In and Out (Sorry to those who think that is blasphemous).    My boyfriend and I went here twice on our visit to Tempe.  Gotta load up on the goods while we can!""",0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,"Open late! This place is always relatively clean when hubby and I visit; and we like that they deliver the food to your table (kind of nice for a fast food joint). We partake of the chicken strips with white gravy and toast from time to time. The burgers aren't bad either ~ pretty large and not frozen-tasting. I also like the fact that they use mustard on their burgers; since I'm a mustard fan. They're also good at honoring my husband's standard order of \only lettuce and tomato.\"" Last but not least; the fries are very boring; but the onion rings are good. Go for the o-rings if you're ordering a burger.  Overall; a good place to catch some late night fast food!""",0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,I don't like the food here; except for the onion rings (they are huge). The burgers are boring and the fries are similarly lame. I'd much rather go up the road to In N Out. BUT... my husband and brother LOVE this place & I have to agree that the service is outstanding; especially for fast food (thus the three stars). Would I recommend it; no. But it is a place I find myself at every once and again.,0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,Forget the fact that virtually all fast food tastes like heaven after a long night of partying. I've been to this location in varying states of intoxication and they have always provided top notch customer service; even though its 3:30am; I'm probably still drunk and probably talking too loud or not making much sense. The people there always have a big smile and treat all their customers very very well. I would recommend this place to any college student in a late night quest for greasy; tasty; delicious food.  The one thing I would recommend is that you specify that your chicken is fresh; and by that I mean that it hasnt been sitting in the warmer for any longer than 5minutes. However that is something you should do at every fast food place.,1
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,Went here for an emergency food stop to put a much needed chocolate shake intermission on a night of drinking.   The only problem; I didn't order a big enough sized shake!   The shake and burger were delicioso and probably part of the reason I feel slightly less terrible this morning. What a burger!,0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,With mass chain restaurants; I can't necessarily review the food; as it's standard throughout each franchisee. However; this specific Whataburger is unbearably slow--you can expect to wait about 15 minutes for a relatively simple order. This isn't exactly because of lazy employees; but I believe the restaurant is understaffed frequently. Once; after an ASU football game; there were four employees manning the restaurant for about forty to fifty customers; and I waited about 45 minutes after ordering to receive my food.,0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,"Good fast food for the money; the ingredients tasted fresh and were made to order. \What a burger!\"" indeed.""",0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,"I just moved here and the Whataburger is right down the street.  I have been there a few times and I really dig the burgers.  They are much bigger than most fast food chains with a slightly toasty bun.  They seem to be a little tricky to order; but I am getting there since I only get them \Plain and Dry with Cheese\"".  I really enjoy the fries they are slightly squishy which is just the way I like them.  They even have ketchup in the little dunking containers.  The only down side is they seem to take quite awhile when you are in the drive through. Haven't quite figured that out yet.  Maybe I'll go in and order and see if it takes long.""",0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,"OK; it's been a while since I had a fast food burger; but it was moving day for my lovely daughter Whitney; yesterday. The menu selection for moving day lunch is \bag of burgers\"" for the moving crew; of which I was a part. If you are going to do chain; drive through burgers; you can do far worse than Whataburger (I mean you MickieD; and you too; Burger King!). I like the fact that Whataburger toasts the buns and smears on a little butter flavored...something; grease; oil; lard...I have no idea; but it adds to the taste and doesn't make me ill; so thumbs up! They don't get the order wrong any more often than any other drive through place; and when they do; they have remade the order without attitude; so that's nice. Over the years; I have tried a couple of other things on their menu; and they do a pretty good job with a chicken sandwich and sausage biscuit from their breakfast menu. Again; far superior to some of their national competitors. Good for the moving day \""bag of burgers\""; but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there (BTW; when is Lucky Boy going to put a place in Old Town Scottsdale?).""",0
6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,"This place is a fast-food Mecca. Despite my best intentions; I have just enough self-control to maintain an unsightly fast-food indebted belly; so I come here often. Much too often. I'm not sure if Misty (who is a lovely and sweet lady) finds it odd that I've recited my order to her enough times that I know her better than most of my immediate family; but if she does find it odd (and I know I do) she's excellent at pretending otherwise. If I ever come in and she asks me if I want \the regular\"" I'll know it's a sign I should cut back. But instead I'll probably just order something different. Maybe I'll add jalapenos to my burger; I don't know. I hope it doesn't get to that point.   The menu at Whataburger is pretty great - it has every option you'd expect from a burger joint and an \""all-time favorites\"" menu that has some specialty burgers which are all fantastic; and though their burgers are always higher-priced than some of the other places you can go; they're big burgers. Everything I've tried on the menu has been fantastic; but it doesn't really matter; because I always order one of two things. To start; I always order a patty melt. Two patties; melted cheese; grilled onions and a sauce that I'd go into detail about if I wasn't concerned about alienating readers from displaying an alarming amount of affection for it. The patty melt is big and filling; but me being the careless fat man that I am I usually order a meal of chicken strips on top of it and make it a large. The meal comes with 3 strips; fries; a drink; a slice of texas toast cut diagonally (and we all know bread tastes better when cut that way); and your choice of dipping sauce. I always get gravy because it's perfect for dipping the bread into. Thank god they have diet Dr Pepper in the fountain so that I can keep this meal healthy and low-calorie. I always get spicy ketchup with my order instead of regular. I'm not sure I think it's better - in fact I'm pretty sure it's not; but sometimes the novelty wins out.  Sometimes; when I'm feeling adventurous; I make the patty melt the meal and get 2 honey butter chicken biscuit breakfast sandwiches instead of the chicken strips meal. That's where I find the only limitation with this place - they only serve breakfast between 11 PM and 11 AM. Fortunately I'm a goon and often don't wake up until the sun has gone down; which makes that time period take up a good portion of my day. On the other hand; what should be \""morning\"" for me is often long past 11 AM. Oh and there was one other time when the guy working the drive-thru made me pull around front because it was going to take them a little longer to cook up all the food for the massive one-man feast I ordered; and he assured me he would throw in 2 apple pies for making me wait but instead he only gave me 1. I'll hold a grudge over that unforgivable crime until the day I die.  But this whataburger is open 24 hours. Even the inside is open all the time; and that's good because there aren't many other places where I can pig out at 4 AM except Filiberto's which always carries a much stronger \""you might get murdered here\"" vibe at that hour; and I like to feel warm and safe while I destroy my body. I've spent enough money here to put one of my future children through college; and sometimes my individual orders are big enough that they cost more than anything you could get at a 5-star restaurant. And it might just be because I'm almost entirely classless; but I'm pretty sure I'd rather eat here.""",0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,I've pre-ordered from here several times; and dined in just once. Just about every time we order ahead; our food is messed up in some way-- we paid for chips and didn't get them was the most recent mistake. It's not an earth shattering error; just annoying when you don't get what you pay for.  I can't quite figure out what the difference is between this location and all the others-- maybe the age or experience of the staff? It just seems a little inconsistent.,0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,While I wait for the fine people at Chipotle to finally wise up and build a location north of the Loop 101; this one is the closest to my home in Desert Ridge.  With a craving for a burrito bowl; and Chipotle's easy online ordering; I put in my girlfriend and my usual order (which was originally made for another location by our old home) with a single click and drove down to PV Mall.  There's nothing that really sets this Chipotle apart from the others.  It has the typical look and feel of every other Chipotle ever built.  The food is the usual quality I have come to expect from this quick service chain.  My only real put off was that my order was not ready on time.  The confirmation email said our food would be ready by 8:10pm.  I walked in at 8:12; skipped the line and went to register; waited for the person paying to finish; then told the cashier that I was there for my online order.  It hadn't even been made yet.  The staff quickly put it together in less than five minutes; which allowed me to jump ahead of three or four people who had been waiting; but that also means if I just left my home earlier; it would've taken about the same amount of time.  Not the worst thing to ever happen; but it does defeat half the purpose of online ordering.  Having said that; here's a tip for all the people who complain about the long line at lunch time.  This location is right outside a mall surrounded by a ton of apartment complexes; retail centers; and office buildings.  It's going to be busy.  Order your food on chipotle.com (there's also a fax form on the website; or call ahead; if you're old school) and skip over all the people who did not plan ahead.  If they screw up and don't make your order right away like they did with me; they'll drop everything and make it.   No need to feel like a jerk.  You're now just smarter than the other customers who are now mad at you.  You're welcome.,1

RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,Waiting in a long line to order my burrito; I can almost imagine waiting here to see a bank teller. Instead of servers scooping beans behind the counter; I imagine bank tellers scooping up cash. This Chipotle gives off a banking vibe for a reason. It's a story of the circle of life; the circle of the life of a Mexican grill.  A few years ago; there was a thriving Blue Burrito Mexican grill in this location. It grew a bit old and stale; however; eventually closing. I still miss their multi-colored corn chips and salsa bar. The building was torn down and a modern Wachovia Bank branch rose in its place. Heaven knows that Phoenix can always use another bank branch! And what happens? Wells Fargo acquires Wachovia. But Wells Fargo management felt they didn't need three bank branches within a block of each other. Apparently two will do. So they closed this branch. Who comes to the rescue? Chipotle! Converting the location back into a Mexican grill; completing the circle of the life of a Mexican grill.  It is a nice location. Long lines at peak times. But I do have trouble getting too excited about Chipotle; a concept purchased; developed and expanded by - gulp - McDonald's. The success of which has spawned boring not-so-fast food chains in nearly every ethnic food category. I'd rather go down Cactus Road for some local Mexican flavor at our own not-so-fast food Carolina's.,0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,Great service; great food...it was a lot of fun! Love the guac.,1
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,Good; smart choices available for healthy eating. Especially like the hormone free chicken. Fast; friendly service.,1
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,So this may in fact be the worst Chipotle in existence. Let me explain.  Every time I show up craving a burrito bowl; there's a huge line to the door. Each person in line is wondering why they're there. You can tell. They're wondering why they put up with the low quality; the terrible service; the indifferent management; the unacceptable price of guacamole; the attitudes of the guy asking you what you want -- or more often; telling you to hold on. The only time I've come here and not had to wait in line; this troll still told me I had to wait because they were making an order for a  family (not in attendance).  I've checked in to this place a few times; and I've been to the Chipotle by Fashion Square a few thousand. For some reason; that place is bomb and this place sucks. At this location; you have to stand in line among dine-in patrons and witness the slop that you're about to ingest and the looks of disappointment on their faces after each unfulfilling bite.  If you've already decided to eat at Chipotle; you've probably had Chipotle before. If you're like me; you go to get a burrito bowl with no rice because you're a Slow Carb or 4 Hour Body fanatic. You know that you can get what you need (not necessarily what you want). If you want a delicious authentic Mexican meal; go across the street to Julio's. If you want to hate yourself and write a whiny Yelp review about it; come here.,0

RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,"If you're looking to enjoy a huge burrito; this is the place to go. Although when I went; the \burrito artist\"" was giving me a hard time due to the fact that I was having a hard time ordering. Since I haven't had Chipotle for quite some time; I was overwhelmed by all the options. But it was worthwhile because the burrito was superb!""",0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,"This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I Understand that they get busy but I've been to many locations with long lines that move quickly. This location however; is the SLOWEST one in the world.   The line is always to the door and you can expect to wait 15-20 minutes before paying. Most of the workers are soooo slow. Each time I've been in they are always low on meat or guacamole and you have to stand there and wait minutes for it to be replaced.   Also the parking is horrible. The \lot\"" is super tiny. Tonight there was no parking available and I had to park across the street at the mall and walk over.   All in all I'm done coming here. I'd rather drive to 7th and Bell for good service and parking.""",0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,Busy; but the line moves fast. That seems to be a standard at Chipotle. However; I have to admit I love the food. I have never had a bad burrito/bowl and; it is always fresh. The amount of food is enough to fill you up with out the chips; but I always have to order them. There is something about the chips... a hint of lime; I think. The staff is very knowledgable and will answer all your questions.,1
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,In my opinion; you can never go wrong with Chipotle. It's quick; tasty; and they use all natural ingredients. The steak burrito bowl is my absolute fav; their steak has a nice spiciness to it. Their staff has always been friendly and inviting every time I walk through the door.   You can also order online before and pick it up at a certain time at your local Chipotle. The tacos are also great if you're a taco fan. If you order a meal with a drink it usually comes out to about $10; and without the drink you're getting a great bang for your buck!   A great choice when looking for a satisfying; quick; hearty meal.,1
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,When I go out to eat at a place that looks like this brand; the last thing I expect to do is stand in line to order my food.  I've heard they have good food; but for me; I want to go in sit down and have a server take my order.  If I want to place an order at the counter; I'll go to Taco Bell,1
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,I gave this a 5 star rating right after they opened this location. Since then; I have seen the quality of employees go up and down. I don't know if they have a high turnover rate for employees or what; but the service has been... inconsistent. About half of the time; we get the super-awesome 5 star service and food; but the other half; they have inattentive employees that give bizarre proportions of food that is inconsistently seasoned.  On our most recent visit; we had a really awesome and helpful person at the tortillas; beans; and meat station that helped us try the new tofu stuff; was awesome and helpful; and then we went to the salsa; etc guy who got my stuff mostly right; and then we went to the cashier that was distracted and slow.  I don't know what to think of it; overall; but the food is still good consistently enough that we will keep coming back. Management is clearly trying; but I think they may just not have the right people available to hire to be the kind of awesome they want to be. The rating is 4 star because it's about 50% 3 star; 50% 5 star.,0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,Every Chipotle I have ever been to has always had a line out the door; so it's expected every time I go. Despite the long lines; service is usually pretty quick. This is the SLOWEST Chipotle I have ever been to. The employees had no sense of urgency at all. I have never seen anyone scoop beans or rice that slow before.  When it time to pay; there was no cashier... She was refilling napkins that didn't need to be refilled at the time. After she rang the guy in front of me; she turned and jumped to bring bags of chips down from the top shelf to the bottom shelf.. There were already chips on the bottom shelf and she completely ignored me and the huge line behind me. Employees don't seem to know how to prioritize! Also; the parking lot is huge; but the way it is laid out provides hardly any spaces and makes it really difficult to drive/park in.,0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,So I would normally rate this place as wonderful; always have great service. Except today I came in like I always do to get a quesorito. (Quesadilla/burrito)  And this young kid proceeds to TELL ME that next time he would prefer I come in before their rush house so HE doesn't have to take time making my quesorito!  UMM EXCUSE ME? What I do in my personal time is nome of your business and YOU are supposed to ACCOMODATE To the customer...not the other way around. I was so furious with this rude comment that I just had to leave a review; it completely upset me the whole time will eating my food. If you are the manager and see this review make sure you talk to your employee about Customer Service and Respect!  *but as we were leaving another worker came up and said he would fix that problem. So I still give this place 4 stars.,0
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,I'v gone to this Chipotle a couple of times and everytime the workers have been polite and nice to me. This one usually isn't very busy so if you looking for a place to order a quick borrito this is the place to go. The design of the building is also very nice and has been clean everytime I have eaten their. In all I recommend this Chipotle over the other ones because of the great employees and quick making of the food.,1
RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,I had an aweful experience with this location while trying to order for 48 teachers for our school teacher appreciation.  It took me three phone calls to different managers to get an answer on the order to begin(I should have gone to a different restaurant then)after finally getting a response I ordered 48 burritos via a manager.  When my other PTA board member went to pay he confirmed that we had 5 burritos ordered.  Those were the 5 special ones and not the other 43.  They didn't know about a discount they had given us and the tax exempt.  She was told to bring it when I picked up and they would credit her card.  Well I was worried about my order so I showed up 15 minutes early the manager let me know I was early.  I informed her that I knew that.  I also was right in knowing they had my order wrong.  The manager from the night prior never passed my order to them so it was all wrong.  I waited and as I had 48 teachers waiting for dinner they finished late.  I asked if I could speak to a manager and no one would come speak to me.  They denied ever saying we could use our tax exempt form and would not credit us saying that no one ever told us that and told me they were sorry I felt the way I did.  Never and apology never is there anyway I can help NOTHING.  i totally understand human error but they treated me like dirt.  I would never recommend using them for any large party.  I had multiple burritos marked veggie and chicken and scratched out as teachers waited for their food during conferences.  Also when I asked for the area managers card they said they did not have his information!!!!,0
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,Great service and great subs. I always order an 8in with roast beef; mayo; provolone; and onions. It is always fresh and they never fail to skimp on the meat. These subs are to die for. The only reason why I knocked off a star is because as someone mentioned before; the cheesesteaks are really... Not to die for at all,1

iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,I went here for the first time and ordered the pastrami sandwhich. To put it simply; it was delicious. I will definitely be visiting this place again. Hope the quality stays great.,0
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,This joint opened recently and I finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  I've had Jersey Mike's back in Vegas; but this was my first time trying it here in Scottsdale.  I ordered a regular sized #13 Original Italian (Provolone; Ham; Prosciuttini; Cappacuolo; Salami; Pepperoni; $6.95) and Chips ($.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jersey-mikes-subs-scottsdale-2?select=SAsdgro1HjRXZmKcT9oBRQ#SAsdgro1HjRXZmKcT9oBRQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jersey-mikes-subs-scottsdale-2?select=0ej781QrEV60Ea0nrKipFA#0ej781QrEV60Ea0nrKipFA  The Sandwich is OK; not great.  It doesn't leave me wanting more.  For me; it lacks something....I can't put my finger on it; but it's just not a great Sandwich to me.  TIP - The shopping mall where this place is located is very small and parking spaces are limited.  During the lunch hour and on weekends; the parking lot is overloaded and it's a mess to try and park.    Return Factor - 50%,0
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,Great sandwiches & fast service. The few times I've gone there's always been a line; so you know it must be good! A new favorite lunch spot for our office.,1
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,A whole wheat mini #7; please. Hold the cheese. With spicy mustard; lettuce; tomato and jalapeño. That's about 410 calories and makes me oh; so happy after a workout at the gym.   I love that they slice your meat for you when you order it and all of the toppings are really fresh. I also like that it's a pretty simple set up. There's something like 15 sandwich options; with some hot; some wrapped and others on subs. You can also have a sandwich in a dish if you're gluten free.   I'm a big fan. I also like the rewards program. You get points for every sandwich you purchase and eventually they earn you a free sammich! Heck yeah!,0
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,Very tasty - been twice now. The italian was outstanding - hands down best sub shop of all the chains. Puts Subway to shame. Better than Cousins and even Blimpies which I used to frequent (not anymore!). I would give 5 stars but the cheese steaks are lacking - they have good meat and bread; but they need to toast the bread; and the cheese turns too melted/watery. But the cold sandwiches are amazing. Excellent service too.,1
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,These guys are awesome!!!  Fast service good quality food. The people there were very helpful and the food was outstanding. Ample quantity and they didn't skimp on the meat which is pretty common at places like this.  The veggies are always fresh and the price is spot on to where it should be for a sandwich like that.,1
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,What happened to this place?  I ordered the club and when I got back to work to eat it; there was hardly any roast beef at all.  It was more or less a turkey sandwich with slivers or roast beef.  When you are shelling out $12.45 for a SUB; there should be some meat on it.  Very disappointed and probably won't be going back.,0
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,Tasty sandwich made with fresh ingredients and my exact topping preference; friendly staff; in a bright; clean location.  This place is all that I love about Jersey Mike's!   If you've never been before; it's a really simple sub shop; similar to what you'd find on the East Coast; with fresh ingredients; yummy bread and simple decor.  They don't have a ton of fancy options; but everything is delicious!  Their vegetarian sandwich is a cheese sub with green peppers - my husband and I split the Giant.  They're a tiny bit more expensive than some other sadnwich shops; but their ingredients and service make them a big favorite with us.  Open until 9pm on Sundays!,1
iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,It's a better sub then what you would get from the other sub places & it should be... $$.  The kids that work there don't care; so don't be surprised if they mess up your order or give you some attitude if you make a crazy request; like throwing on a few peppers.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,What a joke. I ordered three 8 inch meatball subs but when we got home they were all 6 inches.  Rip off.... too much money for a crappie deal.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,My boyfriend is in love with Firehouse so I eat there quite a bit. In terms of quality they blow away Subway; Quiznos; etc. Their subs are also quite large; and the hot sauce collection is amusing. I tried the DBacks hot sauce as a joke; and actually found it to be quite tasty. At the same time; I realized I do like hot sauce on my sandwiches. Who knew? Thanks; Firehouse!  I give them four out of five stars for two reasons: 1. One night they gave me the hard sell on the brownies and I caved. They were not anything special. Don't bother. 2. The last time I was there they took way too long to make one sub and there were six people working behind the counter. In addition; two people that ordered after me got their food first. That is seriously irritating.   Definitely a nice alternative to other sandwich chains.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"We got take-out from this place for lunch today; and I was pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a Quiznos-esque experience (which isn't bad; but isn't overly exciting either); but Firehouse exceeded my expectations.   I ordered the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub; which is JUST as good as it sounds:beef brisket topped with melted cheddar cheese and sauces....mmmmm! I devoured the 8\...at the risk of sounding like a pig; I might get the 12\"" next time; just because it was SO tasty I seriously couldn't stop eating it. One of my coworkers who frequents Firehouse a fair amount claims that everything is good...so my only dilemma next time is choosing between the already-proven-to-be-great Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub or something else that (apparently) will be equally as good...so many choices!!!""",0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Excellent food; great friendly service. I have finally found a great sandwich; better than Chompies.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"\Welcome to Firehouse!!\"" That's the greeting you get from the entire staff when you walk in the door (and if you go with my boyfriend; he yells that greeting along with the staff every time ANYONE walks into the place as well). We walked up the register and the staff were wonderful - helpful regarding the menu. The food came out quick; and we could tell it was fresh. I ordered the meatball and it was amazing!   I wish there was one further east (closer to my house); but anytime I'm looking for somewhere to eat in the Chandler area; Firehouse Subs will be on my mind.""",1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I love this place! It's a cute place to bring kids. They will get a fire hat and can take a look at the real fire suits and helmets too. They one thing that drives me crazy about this place is that you can't get a kids sandwich on wheat bread. So I always have to order the kiddos an adult sandwich since I don't feed them white bread. Kind of a bummer.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,OMG SO DANG DELISH!!!! I never knew this place existed and it's just right up the street from me!! There are so many sandwiches I wanted to try but I ordered the New York Steamer Sub which has corned beef brisket & pastrami with melted provolone; that right there is heaven on bread!!  I have to say I am huge Jimmy John's fav; but Firehouse just might be my new number 1.  They even have this touch screen soda machine which I thought I was pretty nifty; I think it boasted 101 different types of drinks; it's a Coke machine; so except coke products but be amazed by all that it does offer.  Service was great; place was great! Gotta go back and try other sandwiches now!,1

yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I think these guys have one of the best hot subs around. I differentiate hot and cold subs because they are completely different sandwiches. There are places in town that have great cold subs but Firehouse has one of the best hot subs around. I don't think there is a bad one on the menu. I love the Italian and the New York Steamer with corned beef and pastrami but the meatball; turkey bacon ranch; club; Engineer are all great. Every time you walk in you are greeted. Now granted sometimes are more exuberant than others. Sometimes you get WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE! and sometimes you get WELCOME to fireh... but you are greeted. Even after that they still remain friendly. They will explain things if you have never been there before or if you have questions. It is always nice and clean and the soda machine is never running low. The one little knock against them is the price. It is a little expensive but so worth it. So much better than some $5 piece of junk. Every once in awhile you get a craving and it is a nice indulgence. It also makes you feel good to round up your order and donate the change to firefighters. I like that little touch too and think more people should do it. Sure it is just change but it is going toward a great cause. I will keep coming back and have a hard time picking which sandwich I want because they are all so good. They get an extra point for having a Coke Freestyle machine. Those are the best.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I would generally give this place 4 stars; but I think I would like to add an extra star for the friendly service I received. The two times I've been here I've had the meatball and the beef brisket sandwich- very yummy. Overall I think for the price point the sandwiches are delicious and tasty. They have a lot of interesting sauces you can try for your sandwich. The overall experience is great and I will be coming back for my yummy sandwiches. This would also be a fun place to take your family to have a sub and enjoy some subs.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I honestly don't even know why I'm writing a review considering I'm not a huge sandwich fan. I came here the other day with my bf and I felt very rushed to order. I ended up getting what I get every where else which was a turkey sandwich with everything on it; EXCEPT TOMATOES. My bf got a cheesy beefy type sandwich and it was super delicious. Mine wasn't too bad...but they put tomatoes on it -__- i wouldn't have cared so much if I wasn't having such a shitty day! But thumbs up for the subs!  Would I come eat here again? Yes :) & tip: try to not be so forgetful sandwich workers ;),0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,These guys are the absolute best. The sandwiches speak for themselves but the service is the best in the valley. It's definitely the exception to the rule the way these guys go out of their way to help out and treat their customers right. Above and beyond - they have me as a life time customer. Thank you!,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,First; let me just say that I believe Firehouse Subs is by far the best sandwich shop in the world; and the New York Steamer (with extra meat; twice toasted) is quite possibly the single greatest accomplishment that mankind can ever hope to achieve.  Also; I am in no way affiliated with Firehouse Subs; though opening up a shop would probably be the greatest thing ever. I would be in absolute heaven if I could eat a sandwich from Firehouse Subs for every meal; every day; for the rest of my life.   I am reviewing this location in Chandler; AZ because; 1) I am moving to Phoenix so I will soon be a frequent diner; and 2) the service is absolutely perfect. I have been to this specific location four times; though I lived next to one in Florida for two years and have consumed more sandwiches from that Firehouse location than most people would consume in their lifetime (at any sandwich shop). The staff is extremely nice (the gentleman that made my sandwich even remembered my name and sandwich order; after only the first visit!; granted I returned the same day; but still :P); and the shop was clean; and there was plenty of staff to take my order quickly.  My sandwich (the New York Steamer; which I usually always order; though I have had all their sandwiches plenty of times); was absolutely perfect and tasted just like I remembered in Florida. The sweet and savory steamed meat; cheese; and sauces lovingly placed between the two slices of toasted bread form a taste unlike any other. The bread is amazing; it's soft; yet toasted enough to where it crackles when grasping the sub; and the process of steaming the meat releases flavors that are unmatched at any other sandwich establishment. I have no issues stating that Firehouse Subs is the absolute best sandwich shop in existence. If you disagree; well; enjoy your inferior subs...more Firehouse for me!  If you are looking for an awesome place to eat; look no further than Firehouse Subs.,1

yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Craving a delicatessan style sandwich and not finding one in our area. So we popped into Firehouse Subs on a Saturday afternoon and they were hopping busy. Gave our order to the friendly clerk and waited (and waited and waited and waited) for our order. The sammies were quite good and definitely worth the wait. Soft bread roll and a tasty turkey sandwich. The dill pickle was crisp and cold. Would I stop in here again; you bet I would. But... I'm still craving that deli sandwich.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,This is my third time here and I love grilled chicken so naturally I ordered a custom grilled chicken strip sub. It is amazing! And it tastes the same every time! Just don't get the deli mustard. Bleh... The staff is great also and they have all the hot sauce you could ever want!,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,This was my first visiting a firehouse sub and I live down the street. The staff has great customer service and very welcoming. It's pretty tough to find parking when I went during lunchtime; but that's manageable. The sandwiches were good; but for the prices it should be bigger!  Definitely a place to go for a quick place to eat during lunchtime.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Firehouse Subs is delicious. You really can't go wrong here. Fresh bread; good quality cold cuts and melt in your mouth cheese. I have recently discovered the New York Steamer which is pastrami and corned beef with provolone and Italian dressing all melted together. It goes especially well with a nice chipotle sauce from the great selection of hot sauces from the counter and also some nice crunchy jalapeno kettle chips.   The special choose from a bunch o' drinks coke machine is pretty cool too; although I get a little overwhelmed and never know what I want. Service has always been great and the tables are always clean even when it's busy. The best time to come during the week is 2pm-3pm to avoid the crazy lunch or dinner rush. Overall Firehouse is delicious; I will be back.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I tried this place out on the recommendations of the Chandler Fire people I work with; since they offered a free sub on your birthday; and yesterday was my birthday. I tried the Engineer; which is smoked turkey with grilled mushrooms. It was good; but a little small for an almost $7 sandwich. I had the medium and it was only slightly larger than a hot dog bun; but the ingredients were fresh and good. The service was a little slow considering they had 7 people behind the counter; and a manger greeting people. I took more than10 minutes to get my sandwich; and since I was in line for 5 minutes that doesn't leave much time to eat if you're on a half hour lunch break.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Best subs in the world.  Melt in your mouth.  Tremendous service.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Good food; clean and friendly service. The prices are a little  high for what you get; but this is one place everyone in our family can agree on.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Firehouse Subs in Chandler is AMAZING!!! My family and I go there all the time! The staff is super nice and the owner is awesome and friendly! They steam your sandwich once ordered and it's so yummy and fresh! I would recommend this sub shop to all of my friends! My son is almost 2 and loves the kids meal there as well!!  Thanks Firehouse Subs! We love you!,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,My wife and I have been going to Firehouse Subs for the past 2- 1/2 years.  I usually order the New York Steamer which was excellent.   Not in my last visit.  It seems that Firehouse Subs has changed its' meat vendor.  The corned beef in the sandwich looked more like ham than corned beef and it was tasteless.  My wife also commented that the ham in her sandwich was sweeter than it used to be.  It looks like we will not be patronizing Firehouse Subs any longer.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,So this was my second trip to firehouse. The first time I was not happy with my order. I got the sub with turkey and mushrooms. This time I got the smoke house cheddar sub. It was good; I put the house hot sauce on it which made it better. As of now I dont see it being that great. Though there are a few other items I want to try. The steamer looks real good.  Firehouse is a good alternative to a subway. But isn't something right now that I would go out of my way for.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"Out in Chandler today and was excited to finally try this place that was recommended by some locals.  Wasn't sure what to expect for a sub shop.  Different concept as far as first impressions.  Place was packed and it was about 1pm.  . Every table taken. Fireman equipment and artifacts everywhere.  Right away I'm trying to break down the menu as fast as I can since people behind me are waiting and it's an order-at-the-counter place.   Staff was great.  Asked what I was in the mood for. Pointed out a few items.  I went for a sub w/ turkey; mushrooms; and Swiss.  I asked if the mushrooms were fried.  The employee explained how they have a special press that steams the meat and cheese together before it goes on the roll.  Nothing there is fried.    Sandwich was very good. Enjoyed the crispness of the roll.  There was a great amount of turkey; unlike most popular sub shops around.  I would have liked a bit more cheese and mushrooms.  A little more \savoryness\"" but I think that could have come in had I chosen one of their specialty sauces.  I'm definitely trying one of the sauces next trip! I think I needed a little more \""zip!\""""",1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,The food was great but over priced. The placed was packed yet the service was exceptional which is a rare combination. I would definitely recommend this place place to my friends just remember to save up before you stop in.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I absolutely love this place because there are a few things about firehouse subs that stands out from the rest of the other sub places. First of all; i've always had great customer service; the employees are always helpful and not so rude like some of the people i've seen at nearby sub places.   The subs are flavorful; I actually want to go get one right now because just the thought of it makes me crave them. I always get the italian sub; they put in the works and boom you got a juicy sub with lots of flavor. There is just some kind of sauce in it that drips while Im eating it; whatever it is; its delicious. Don't miss out on these great subs my fellow yelpers!,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I got a meatball sub from this location; and it was excellent.  Location is very clean; and staff was very friendly.  They have an online ordering option; so my food was ready to go as soon as I arrived.  The only negative is that is a bit pricey.  Over $10 for a 12 inch sub and beverage.  Not a ripoff since the food was very good; but still a little higher than I'd like to be paying for a sandwich.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Let me just start by saying YUMMMMMMM! We happened to be in the area and stopped in to give it a try; the employees were very friendly and greeted us immediately. I ordered the Italian (#4) and it was probably the best hot Italian sub I have ever had all the way down to the dressing that had a hint of sweetness to it. The sub was perfectly assembled the bread was crusty and warm but still soft and fluffy; the variety of meats was layered nicely topped with veggies and melted provolone(yumm). My fiance had the New York Steamer (#3) which was very tasty as well; it was stacked with corned beef brisket and pastrami topped with melted provolone and then touch of mustard just enough to give it that zing! We will definitely be coming back here!!!!,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Maybe I went on an off day but I was not happy with my sub. I think I ordered an Italian Sub. What I got was a soggy sub which I didn't even finish half of it. I have heard people rave about this place but I don't see it.  If you are in Chandler and you are craving a deli sandwich just go to Jason's Deli. I'm not saying they are great (almost no sandwich shops are) but that's your best bet unless you really want to feel like you could have made your meal at home; which happens at Jason's Deli too...,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"I went to Firehouse for the first time this past weekend. The place was clean and I enjoyed the decor.   The sandwiches were very good and fresh. The brisket and cheddar sandwich was really good. I also split the engine company sub with my fiancee and enjoyed the sandwich. The sandwiches were made within 5 minutes of the order.  I liked the crushed ice instead of the cube you typically get at most eating esablishments.   I didn't find the food too expensive. The cost for 2 sandwich combos was $16-17.  About what you would pay at Dilly's.  I expect I will hear \Welcome to Firehouse\"" in the future.""",0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Went to the Firehouse for the first time today on my lunch break.  Very friendly staff; quick service and YUMMY subs!  Because the sandwiches are steamed they are sooo soft and juicy.  They totally don't skip on the meat; though I would have enjoyed extra veggies.  I will for sure go back again.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"To start this out with; let me make it clear I have experience with Firehouse Subs. I'm from the East Coast; where they originate. I had one one block away from my campus housing while I was in college; and another resided in the same building as a friend of mine's condo during that same time.   With that out of the order; Firehouse is good. Very good. A large combo is a little pricier than a deal at Subway (a large combo is ~$10); but it's definitely worth it. The medium combo is ~$7.50; but the large is; I feel; well worth it; as the sandwich is so much bigger.  For starters; your sub is steamed. STEAMED! The way God meant meat and cheese to be prepared on a sandwich.   This comes at a price; however. Don't expect the 'have it your way' mentality of Subway; you have a choice of ~10 subs; each of which comes with a selection of meats and cheeses. Some of these can be served fully involved (mayo; mustard; lettuce; tomato); others can not (I'm looking at -you-; Steamer. You'd be perfect if you'd just loosen up a bit and take some extra condiments like a good girl). Well; you might be able to explicitly ask if they can be served that way; but it's going to be up to the server; the ones that are to be served fully involved (if you want them that way) say \Served Fully Involved\"" on the menu.  But my God; even with these limits is it worth it. These sandwiches are large; filled with meat and cheese; tasty as hell; and Firehouse provides a huge assortment of hot sauces to include on it. USE THEM! Find one you like; it really does make the sandwich taste better. I nearly cried when I found out a friend had been eating at Firehouse but had never known the hot sauces were there to be tried and experimented with by the customers; and so had never had the joy of a hot sauced sub.  Now; the reason this isn't 5 star...because of what has been done to the Firehouse Subs brand hot sauce. Yes; they have their own. Back in GA; it was -amazing-; best hot sauce there. Mild enough you could slather it on like ketchup; spicy enough to give it some heat; and tangy enough to give it flavor. I'm not sure why the one here was different (different mixing location? Different (bad) batch from those I've had in the past? I don't know); but it was a little bit spicier than it should have been (making it so my usual habit of slathering it on made the sandwich a little more spicy than I like. Still good; still edible; but not perfect); and less tangy.   Still; though; try Firehouse the next time you want a sub. It's so much better than those other; lesser; sub shops.""",0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Alright; I am giving this place a 5-star based off one sub - The New York Steamer. Holy crap this was good.  I actually didn't even get to eat this sub fresh as some stuff came up before I could stuff my face. Still; one of the best subs I've ever had in my life despite the slightly soggy bread due to me having to nuke it.  So; I actually ordered this delicious little morsel online. They said that they would email me when it was ready; but that it would at least take 30 mins. I never received an email; but instead a phone call. I rushed over there and snagged it.  The one problem I had with this was that I had some difficulty finding the place. The main display/sign and door faces away from the road. I actually passed by it a few times and ended up further down the road. Just know that it is only a few hundred yards from the road.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I absolutely love the New York Steamer sandwich; but when I went in today to place my order; I was distracted by the cashier inquiring about my adorable grand-daughter (who I was holding) and I guess I said Engineer instead of Steamer.  Imagine my disappointment when I peeled back the wrapper to reveal turkey and mushrooms instead of corned beef and pastrami.  Fighting back tears of defeat; I sunk my teeth into my tender regret.  You know; it was pretty good.  But next time I'll write down my order and just hand it to the cashier.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"The thing that really sets Firehouse Subs apart from its competitors is its amazing service. Even over the noon hour--the busiest time of day--at least one employee greets you at the door. Everyone who works there is cheerful and courteous. They deliver the food to your table; And the food arrives quickly.  The food is consistently flavorful. Their menu is standardized; so if you want a sub made your way; you would be better off at Subway. They will leave off certain ingredients if you ask; but the options are limited. I don't mind this because it makes the line go quicker. You don't wait 20 minutes for the people in front of you to pick their ingredients.  The soda machine with 200+ flavors is way cool. One benefit is that there is normally a single line behind the machine. You don't have people crashing into or cutting in front of each other as happens with traditional soda fountains. I happened to talk recently with a fellow who works for Coca-Cola. He said these machines cost around $17;000; so any business that has at least one of them must be doing well.  The cashier always asks whether you would like to round up your purchase to the next dollar to benefit the Firehouse Public Safety Foundation. Normally; I dislike it when cashiers ask you to donate to the store's favorite cause because I already give to my own favorite causes. However; I always say \yes\"" at Firehouse because donating to first responders is definitely a good cause; assuming that the money goes where they say it does.  As other reviewers have mentioned; the food is pricey. For a few dollars more; you could get a decent meal at a sit-down restaurant.  Sadly; I no longer eat at Firehouse Subs because I recently became a vegetarian; and they don't offer a vegetarian option. I'm sure they would leave the meat off one of their salads on request; but when I go to a sub place; I want a sub. So I eat at Subway instead; even though the quality; service; and atmosphere are lacking by comparison.  If you are carnivorous; I highly recommend Firehouse Subs.  UPDATE:  After posting this as a four-star review; a representative of Firehouse Subs private messaged me to address a few of the concerns I expressed above. She informed me that they do indeed have a vegetarian sub on the menu. She also explained more about the Firehouse Public Safety Foundation.  Since posting the original review; I have returned to Firehouse Subs in Chandler twice. Each time I ordered the veggie sub. The reason I wasn't aware of it earlier is that it is not on the big menu behind the counter. I found it listed only on a small revolving menu on the countertop. I would suggest that they do more to promote the veggie sub because it's good. It is much more flavorful than its counterpart at Subway. If you order The Works and ask them to skip the mayo; it's fairly healthy.  Also; I want to clarify that in the original review; I did not mean to imply that their Foundation is shady. I was simply trying to be objective; i.e.; I did not want to state something I could not verify. After learning more about the Foundation and reading more about it on the Internet; I think it's well respected and does great work. Certainly; there are few causes more important than helping first responders.  Primarily because I like their veggie sub; I have upped my original rating to five stars. I may be taking some risk in doing so because Yelp seems to be more likely to filter five-star reviews. But I believe the rating was earned.""",1

yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I've enjoyed two outta the three sandwiches I've tried here.  Club - Good. Beef & Cheddar - Very Good Corn Beef & Pastrami - Nope  I will be back for the Beef & Cheddar. It's insanely good. The chili here is also tasty. It's meaty with no beans; just the way I like it. (kind of reminds me of the one at Jason's Deli) And I especially love the Cherry Limeaid. Yeeeee! No need to go to Sonics!  Service is whatevers. Some of the staff are friendlier than others but nobody I've encountered was rude... so it's all good.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,It's a great place to wait 20 minutes plus for an incorrect sandwhich. Don't bother informing the manager Barbara either. She'll insist she personally made the sandwhich and made the order as it appears on your receipt which is still not true. It was ridiculous how the manager was not very customer friendly. Would have loved this place if we got an apology instead of a defensive manager. Waste of time. Also plan to wait and watch other and larger food orders go out before yours as they ordered after you. Won't be going back to this location.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I love Firehouse Subs.  Soooo delicious!  I'm a regular here because it's close by.  Even if I wasn't close; I'd still be a regular.  I haven't had a bad sub or bad service here yet (knock on wood).  Love the sub card they have; too.  I always enjoy it when a place rewards me for eating there on a regular basis.  They just added a touch screen fountain pop machine; too; which I thought was cool since I'm a computer nerd.  It's not the cheapest place on earth; but that's my only gripe.,0
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Yum! Went there today for the first time and loved it. My parents have been raving about the one in Las Vegas; so they were excited to take us there. The subs were amazing; and there were a ton of sauce options on the counter (which I LOVE!). I even splurged for a brownie; which I never do at sandwich shops; but it was so tasty!    The service was also wonderful; I could tell the staff was all happy to work there and they really made it a point to make their customers feel welcome.,1
yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,First of all; kudos to a sandwich shop for being open until 10 pm. I was very impressed with my first firehouse subs experience and have been very satisfied with my repeat visits. The subs are always delicious and best served nice and hot. Their meatballs are fantastic and my picky one year old daughter loves them.   My wife and I find the mustard that they use to be way too strong and tends to overpower the sandwich. We always ask for our subs without the mustard; but maybe that's just us. The service has been great and they have been very helpful meeting the dining needs of my little ones every time. Bonus points for having the coke freestyle machine; but where's the ginger ale?!?!?!  Love this place. We will be returning often.,1

I decided to go back to the restaurant; when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me; the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag; and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had; and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)  I must say I was impressed with this manager; and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially \""un-F$@k's\"" your food and returns it to you.  Overall great customer service; consistent food; and a good option for takeout in surprise.""",1
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,I decided to try it out; I'm celiac and therefore can only eat gluten free... They have an easy to understand GF Menu with anything you can possibly want.  I placed my order online and picked the exact pickup time. I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!  I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store; so try doing an online order and pickup forsure!  p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!,0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Typical big business chinese place. Slightly fancy but very average food. Kinda like a fast food place.... you walk up and order then get your own drinks etc. Portions are very small. Prices are higher than average.  They offer a few different vegetarian options but it all tastes pretty bad  do yourself a favor and also support a local business and eat at big buddha around the corner. Its much better food,0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,This is pretty good. My wife and I usually split lettuce wraps and an entree of some sort. It's convenient to be able to order take out online. Overall; if I'm really in the mood for chinese food I'm going to make the drive a little further out to Big Buddha on Greenway and the 303; but this is a good substitute as it's about 1 minute from my house.,0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food; oh yeah; some very good places mostly but Asian; youre better off staying at home and cooking.   We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad; chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle; the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu; the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers.   With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad; huh?,0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,"Food is good and consistent and the service is always great. I've never dined in; but get take-out fairly often. I love being able to just say \same as last time\"" when I call it in. Not as good as PF Changs; but certainly better than most other Asian-ish places in Surprise. Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything; but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all; it's not my favorite place; but I always enjoy it every time.""",0

pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Came here with my friend today cause we were starving and decide to go whichever next place we saw. And we were very surprised at how pretty the inside of the restaurant looked. The decor was amazing. I ordered the Japanese teryaki bowl vegetarian style and it was amazing. I loved the tofu and the brown rice and the veggies. My friend ordered the lo mein and she loved it. We didn't finish due to the fact that the portions are huge. (we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place; and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice! And this place is vivid and just amazing. WAY better than panda express. I will definately come here again; and recomend it to everyone!!!,1
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,"Awful service and average food. Ordered two dinners and two apps. They brought 1 app; 4 minutes later brought 1 dinner; after another 3 minutes they brought the other dinner. When I asked the server when my other app was coming he said \I don't know what he is doing back there\"".  So I asked the cooks what's up and they had not even started it. 5 minutes later it came and the manger didn't say a word when dropping it off. Food was average.""",0

pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,What can I say; I'm a sucker for Pei Wei.  When we lived in California; I heard the place was shut down.  Glad to move back and see it open.    Take out rocks; call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name; so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same; or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much!   The only thing I don't like; and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it; is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer; then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise; I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :),1
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Pei Wei is a fast; easy; cheaper PF Chang's - and that's what makes it great! If you like the tofu dishes at PF Chang's; you'll love Pei Wei. The food here is great. The service is exceptional. And the portions are huge! I usually end up taking about half the food home with me. Also; compared to other lunch spots near by (like Paradise Bakery); it's really not all that busy. Of course; it's not authentic Asian food; but you shouldn't be expecting that when you come here anyway.,1
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.  This is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much; especially since it's more of a counter service experience.,0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,"Took the family there last week.  Ordered fried wontons; sweet and sour beef; Mongolian beef; honey crusted chicken and pad Thai noodles.    The Mongolian beef was delicious; however the white rice was undercooked; some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.  Honey crusted chicken also quite good; same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.  Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.  They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls; we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he \let us keep the spring rolls\"" and \""didn't charge is for all of our drinks\"" as if he did us a favor.  Overall the food was decent; the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!  I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day..""",0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Love the food but it's great at all locations. The customer service is horrible at this location. Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time.  No thank you; nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???,0

pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,45 minute wait for a take out order. Tried calling it in; but now I see why it didn't work. Even the manager is ignoring the phone.,0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Same consistent quality and service; just like locations in ca; San Marcos and others.  Good for group of 8.  Prices are reasonable; you can order a few items and try it all; family style. Prices $8 to $15 range.,1

Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average; edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it. My daughter loves fried rice and wouldn't even eat hers; it was so greasy. We all ended up eating PB&J's and it was 100x better than anything we brought home.""",0

pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,I love the lettuce wraps here. They are simply the best.  I order carry out often from here. I occasionally dine in.  My problem with the dinning in is the seating. It is always difficult to find a seat.  The place really needs to expand.  If you have a party of more than 4 most days you can hang it up.  Other than the seating I like it. Large portions of rice and noodles.  A little stingy on the meat.,0
pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Service is a 4  . Very sloppy also the hot and sour soup aint that  bad if u add enough chile paste and salt and soy sauce the gentleman named pop he is the manager great service from him and this other lady did not get her name unfortunetly  I've changed my rating 2 times that's how impressed I am,1
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,"This was my first visit to a Culver's restaurant. My first observation was the outside area; it was clean and litter free with ample parking. The inside was also very clean and neat; as was the bathroom.  The owner of the store personally took my order and he was friendly and very professional. I ordered the \Culvers Deluxe\"" platter; which included fries and a drink. The double meat; double cheese burger came piled high with bacon and fresh veggies. The burger was excellent; hot and plenty of juice. Fries were ok; crispy; could have been more of them. Overall; prices are about average for a burger combo. The food was above average for a fast food joint. The staff was friendly and helpful. I give Culver's a thumbs up and I am sure I will visit them again.""",1
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,"Culver's has become an institution in our family; having frequented the Deer Valley location when we lived in North Phoenix. Having recently moved to the west side; we were pleasantly surprised to see this new location opening; and we were not disappointed!

l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,I love this place!   Not only does it feel welcoming; but the food is fresh. It reminds me of Braums in Oklahoma.  The frenchfries are fresh and great. When you bite into a burger it just feels right. I enjoy how great their customer service is. You go inside it's clean and sanitary.   The drive in sometimes takes a while but because the fresh burgers and fries I'm okay with it. I love how in  the drive in they will explain what's all in something and they are promptly on knowing the menus. They greet wheb drive up and also I love to ask what their favorite malt is so I can try.,1
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,Tried this location after often going to the Peoria near Cactus location. Was very happy with the meal and my daughter wanted a dinner so she ordered the chopped steak and was happy with her meal. This will be a regular family spot as we were all so full afterward.,0
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,Cheese curds.....yum. The custard; extra yum. The service; almost always great. Today the cashier was a bit of a snot. The fried chicken was the show stopper today. I would have never guessed you can get chicken that good there. AND the fries are the ONLY fries offered by a national chain that gives McDonald's any competition.,0
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,Yummy treats and great service.,1
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,I have eaten there in the past and has been a while.  Food was very good when this restaurant first opened.  Just went there 01/18/2014. I ordered the chicken dinner to go; and it was the worst crap ever.  First the cashier ran back and asked the cook if there was any chicken.  I received 2 legs and  thighs which tasted and looked like it sat under a heat lamp for hours.  For the price your paying u think it would be fresh!  Quality has definitely went down.  Will never again go to this culvers location again.,0
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,Great food!  Great customer service!  Great root-beer!,1
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,Generally disappointing. For one thing; I was picturing more of a Perkins or even Denny's type place. Not fast food. It reminded me more of a Dairy Queen than anything else. The man running the cash register was not exactly friendly. The 3 of us had one order of Walleye and 2 orders of fried chicken. He yelled into the back to find out if they had more fried chicken (it was 6pm on a Saturday). Finding out they did; he said we could have the chicken. When our orders came one plate had two large chicken breasts and the other had a spindly wing and drumstick. Everything was super oily; even by the standards of fried fast food. The breading on the chicken was bland and heavy. Hubby said the walleye was decent but bland. Fries were frozen crinkle fries. I didn't try the roll and didn't hear any commentary on the green beans. The cole slaw was apparently decent but sweet (Miracle Whip).  Although the desserts look intriguing; I probably wouldn't come here again for food.,0
l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,The friendliness of the staff and manager; Joe was superb!!!! I will definitely be returning. Customer service like that is unfortunately very rare so when I receive it I think it's important to point it out! Way to go Joe!!  Oh; the food was great!,1

MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,I love the chicken breakfast sandwhich with egg on it. So great and surprising since I thought of this as a lunch place initially. I love the little hasbrowns too. The splenda lemondae is great for those who like healthy lemonade. great service by happy people here.,1
MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,My favorite fast-food place.  Great food combined with best-in-class service.  The people are always friendly!  I love their chicken.  It beats KFC; Church's; and anyone else you can name.    I especially appreciate three very unique things about them - 1. They are closed on Sundays.  I admire that!  2. The have a family night on Monday.  Kids get a 4 piece nugget meal with every adult combo meal.  3.  Their kid's meal comes with an EDUCATIONAL game or toy!  Their meal also preaches character instead of the latest Disney or Dreamworks movie - sorry Shrek!  A class A place with great food; great service; and competitve prices.  (Sorry; no dollar menu though.),1
MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,"My experience with Chick-Fil-A food has been pretty benign.  And I think that fits their character on the fast food landscape.  Decent; harmless; slightly better than your average burger chain.  I am aware they are owned by a Christian owner and that is why they are closed on Sundays and I respect the decision to take that stand despite any business they may lose on Sunday.  But this morning I stopped into this location - thought I might try their breakfast offerings.  As I stood in line I realized I was hearing some pretty offensive \Jesus Rock\"" over the store audio.  I don't recall the song but I caught lyrics about \""savior of the sinners\"" and \""almighty glory\"" and \""we must repent\""...there was plenty more.  As I said; I respect your decision to close on Sunday's; it's your business.  And this new treat of proselytizing to music - that's your decision as well.  And just as I can't stand people peddling their religion at my doorstep; I won't stick around for the Chick-Fil-A version of a revival - you've gone too far - I turned around and left and will likely never return to a Chick-Fil-A.    What's next; a sign on the entrance \""God Fearing Christians Only\"" or \""We Reserve The Right To Deny Service To Those Who Do Not Share Our Born Again Belief System\""""",0

MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,My favorite thing about this location is the big; enclosed children's play area.

As with other locations; this one has good food and friendly service.  The sodas are not self-serve; but there is always someone walking around making sure your food is okay and checking to see if you'd like refills.,1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,JUNE 2014: It's been a while since I've been in so I thought I would update my review --- FOR THE BETTER! The Codfather serves AUTHENTIC British fish & chips like you would find at the village chippy in England. Authentic texture and flavor; especially with malt vinegar and salt like you should. I've tried everyone else in town with their quirky British names and pub atmospheres; but guess what? Their fish n chips doesn't EVEN compare. I had the tilapia lunch special with an extra piece of fish. The talapia has a different texture and taste than the cod of course. Ask for extra crispy! Crunchy batter is what it's all about! This would work better with the cod since it's a moister fish. The chips are the most authentic as well.  The place has improved GREATLY since I've been there last. You enter at the left door now at the pub area and you're seated by friendly uniformed staff. It used to be that you order at the counter and then seat yourself. Much more like a proper restaurant now which is a big plus. Arrived in time last week for the second half of a World Cup game with England playing. There was absolutely NO OTHER PLACE TO BE for the game! Screens were everywhere.  Also the beer selection has greatly improved. Friday and Saturday still have the all you can eat fish at $12.95 I think. The price went up over the years but hey my original review was 2007. We had to wait a while for our meals but that's OK they were backed up a bit. I'm sure it will be OK when you go. The taste and texture of the fish n chips were PERFECT.,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,This is my go-to place for fish & chips in Phoenix. I wasn't sure what to expect my first visit; but their food is great! The fish is tasty and the service is friendly. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good English style fish & chips!,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Love this place.  It was a weekly spot for me.  Weekends they serve an English Breakfast. $9 flat rate.They offer the meal as a whole or you can a la carte it and buy elements of it.  The breakfast was tasty; always hot. I enjoyed with a pot of hot tea with milk.   As for their namesake; the fish and chips are good. The timing is a bit slow. But it's always hand battered and fried to order. The chips are not typical american thin and crispy; they are thick; a bit soggy; but delicious.  All sauces are on available upon request.  They just recently acquired their liquor license and now you can enjoy a Guiness or New Castle with lunch.   Great place for a quick bite.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,This place was great! Our host was super nice and the restaurant was very clean. It's not very big; but the food was great. We ordered the Scotch egg to start; delicious. The cod and chips was great. We will definitely come back and recommend The Codfather.,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I am really stuck in the middle here with Codfathers.  Part of me loves this place.  They have football on the telly; marmite; and tons of good beers.  The other part of me hates it because of the greasy food and the STRANGE clam chowder.  I just don't know what to do.  I order the mahi and chips.  The fries were really boring and cold.  The fish was decent but really wasn't cooked all the way through.  I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  I was expecting something like Ivars and got some runny cioppino-like stew.  It was really bad until I salted the hell out of it.  Then; it got strangely addictive and I couldn't stop eating it.    Really weird.  I'd like to come back here but I don't think it's going to happen.  I'm sure my wife hated it.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"We visited The Codfather recently; not really knowing what to expect nor really having any preconceived notions; as I hadn't looked on Yelp yet.    First impressions - I was really disappointed that there wasn't more of a pub atmosphere.  The interior is very close to being fast food; and not even as nice as some.  You order at a counter and the food is delivered to your table.  I would agree with the earlier reviewers on some things.  I ordered the large portion of the Cod fish & chips.  I thought the portion size and the fish were quite good.  The batter was crispy and not greasy.  The chips were terrible though.  They were limp; soggy and tasted as if the oil should have been changed about two weeks ago.  I also had some shrimp which were good; but not outstanding.  I too was put off by the cheap \nickel and dime\"" approach - $.25 for more tartar sauce????  And I didn't like the $.35 surcharge for using my debit card.  I thought for a minute I was at ARCO's fish and chips!!     So; the fish was a 4; the chips were a 1; and the decor was maybe a 3.  I have to stretch to give The Codfather a 3 overall.  We will probably keep getting the fish; but for take-out.""",0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,We waited over  10 minutes just us have somebody say hello to us when we changed our beer our waitress right in front of us rolled her eyes.  We waited an additional half hour for our food and there was only three of the table in the restaurant we only ordered a crabcake some clam chowder soup and a meet pocket. That was it.. The meat pocket can out over done.. When I said something she replied that how they alway come out.. Saying all this the food was ok.. She also sweep the whole restaurant as we eat.. Even under our table and chairs... I've been here a few time a the food descent to good the service & ambience not so much.. Needs management.,0

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Take a trip to GB without leaving AZ!  If you are looking for the ambience of an English pub; you won't find it here. If you are looking for authentic English pub food; you WILL find it at Codfather's! (We've traveled to the UK many times and enjoyed traditional pub food a lot. I don't consider myself an authority; but I do feel comfortable making the claim that Codfather's is authentic). They even have a little area set aside selling authentic British candy; sauces; teas; biscuits; and more!   Of course; fish and chips is the first thing that comes to min when thinking pub food; and Codfather's does not disappoint. Cod; catfish; Mahi Mahi; salmon; haddock; halibut... grilled or fried? Small or large? One doesn't get that many options in the UK!! Plus; you get a side dish - how about mushy peas or baked beans? So British! Or perhaps you fancy meat: they offer pies; pasties; sausage; etc. And of course; you can get bangers and mash; or bubble and squeak;  or a ploughman's platter or even an English breakfast.   The portions sizes are very generous. The small fish and chips is big; the large order is bigger! But the ultimate deciding factor is taste. Again; no disappointment. The fish was fried perfectly; not greasy at all and the batter is delicious. The Cornish pasty was huge (half went home to enjoy the next day.)  The beer selection is awesome; too (some bottled; some on tap.) I've never found John Smith's Extra Smooth anywhere else in town!! In addition to the other UK beers (Boddington's Guinness; Fullers); they offer domestics such as Bud & Coors (why; I have no idea!!) as well as small selection of wine.  Service was great; prices are very reasonable and friendly/welcoming staff. Don't be deterred by the location - make your way to 16th & Bell; and enjoy great pub food at this family owned restaurant.,1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,The food was suprising delicious; I'd previously heard that British food was terrible. Anything that they fry has the best batter and the Scotch Egg w ordered was fantastic. We definitely plan on going again and trying more of the food.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"I think John's 10/25/11 review is the most helpful; and so I can only share some of my observations. I think this place would be really cool if it were retro-60's British fish & chips; the sort of place Austin Powers would have gone to. *Contemporary* British is a huge problem for me if it means huge banners of Prince William or Harry or Whoever It Is & What's-Her-Name and God Save The Queen coffee mugs with the queen on it. Huge turn-off for me. I'm just glad they (England) got the 2012 Olympics because that will inevitably make for a more pleasant dining experience.   I don't like LJS's fast-food \fish\"" at all. I did like The Codfather's fish & chips here; tastes much better. I also liked that their silverware (even at lunch) is some damn fine china - especially for a \""fish and chips\"" place.   I do think The Codfather would work better as a \""bar\"" bar ONLY; or a fish & chips place ONLY; because there does seem to be a weird disconnect depending upon where you sit. The whole Sports-Game-on-TV-That-Doesn't-Match-The-Sound-(Music)-You-Hear thing that's common in a lot of places.   Based upon my experience and observations; I don't think The Codfather deserves so many negative reviews. Just doesn't describe The Codfather I went to.     Service: Acceptable/Good  Prices: Reasonable Environment: Will be better once the Olympics happen""",1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Of all the places that I've eaten Fish and Chip in the USA this is by far the best.   The building and actual restaurant was disappointingly American looking despite the picture of the Queen and other UK inspired decoration. I wasn't that hopeful for the quality of the Fish and Chips.  Order was taken by an obvious Brit so my exceptions raised a bit. When the food came it looked just like you'd get in good old blighty. Portion size was good.   The fish came as it should in one piece with the batter lovely and crispy and the fish wonderfully moist and flaky. Chips were proper chunky chips not those horrible 'fries'   If I had one criticism of the place I'd say it was the decoration... its too 'Rule Britannia' maybe thats what Americans want/like but I think it would look better if they made it a bit more like a UK chippy i.e 'Cool Britannia'  Anyway this place is now in my address book for future visits!,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Delicious!! Service was friendly and food was great. I had cod and chips! Superb!,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Top notch fish & chips..... I love businesses where the owners are actually working on a regular basis. Owners usually seem to take more pride in their work; than hired help. Thats the case here as they provide Great customer service. Did I mention the fish & chips?,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"I made the long haul out from east Mesa specifically for the market. Market is a really strong word for the little corner of product they had. They did have a few interesting things that I had been looking forward to trying. Unfortunately; a lot - and I mean a lot - of the items were out of date! The Heinz Salad Cream had an expiry of January 26; and my visit was on February 23! So...nope. There were a few flavors of Walker's crisps; but they were also all expired. Not by as much as the salad cream; so I did buy two packets thinking at least stale crisps won't give me food poisoning. I'll just stick to Internet ordering; I suppose. With so many of the \market\"" food items out of date; there is just no way I would ever try the restaurant side. I'm sad that it was so disappointing.""",0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"Came here with the family on Friday. I had read the previous reviews and I was a bit apprehensive but my MIL really wanted wanted us all to have dinner here.   The area isn't great and the shopping center is older but tidy and orderly. They have two sections inside the restaurant; one for the bar (on the left) which was quite crowded and one for the restaurant (on the right) which was even more crowded :-P  We primarily came for the fish and chips. They have assorted fish (like haddock; cod; cat fish; shrimp; etc) for the fish and chips and you can either get two large pcs of fish with chips for about 10 bucks or the unlimited fish and chips for about 13 bucks (they obviously have other menu items than fish and chips; we just came for the fish). Two of us got the cod; one got the haddock and one got the shrimp; all with a side of chips.   I'm one of those weird people that has to eat each dish one by one so being a carboholic; I started on the fries. I speared two random fries on my plate; put it in my mouth and was immediately regretful. :-/ The two fries were soaked in grease/oil. It was nauseating and I almost called it quits with that bite but I didn't want to offend anybody by not eating so I kept on nibbling.  I'm so glad I kept going because the dish was AMAZING after that initial bite. The fish was light and not too greasy and the fries tasted fresh (they were slightly on the soft side but I'm weird and prefer them a little soft.) My husband had the same issue with his first bite of fries being soggy and the rest being great so all we can think is that maybe they were from the bottom of the fryer or something?   The place was PACKED by the time we got our entrees but the service was spot on. Our waiter was attentive and was knowledgeable on the menu and he even brought out some homemade sriracha sauce for us. My family members were all pretty happy with their dishes too :) (husband LOVED the shrimp!)  After dinner; we went shopping in their British \mini mart\"" (they have a small store in the restaurant; the size of a smallish closet) which was pretty fun; got to see a fun assortment of British food products and candy.   Fun experience; we will be back! But watch out for that first bite of fries ;-)""",1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I'm really disappointed that I have to write such a poor review for this place.  I'm not a big fan of fish; but I love it when it's all fried up and served with fries; so I wasn't worried about coming here.  When we walked in; I was a little confused at the setup; but it kind of grew on me.  It was very clearly a mom and pop style place; and I can definitely appreciate that.  The decor was pretty awful; but endearing at the same time.  I'm not sure why they were trying to cover up their wood tabletops with awful cheap tablecloths; but to each their own.  I also liked their impressive selection of British foodstuffs.  I wasn't too hungry; so I ordered the smaller portion of the cod and chips.  I really liked that they gave you the option to order a little less.  Maybe I was under the wrong impression that this should be a faster service restaurant because you order at a counter and pay at the counter; but our food took forever to get out to us.  The unfortunate things was seeing the cook put our fries onto our plate well before the fish made it.  That left us with lukewarm fries.  The fries; well; they sucked.  They weren't the crispy kind and they weren't salted at all.  The fish; I hate to say it; was disgusting.  It was over-battered and wasn't cooked long enough.  That left me with a nasty mess of mush all over my fish.  I had to scrape it all of to be edible.  Since this place calls themselves the Codfather; and I wasn't pleased with what is supposedly their specialty; I certainly don't see myself coming back.,0

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,We go here once every few months.  The beer is great and they have a good selection.  The decor seems to struggle to find itself; but if the food is really good; who cares what it looks like.  They have added table service; which was not so great; but the beer was good; so......  Always get the cod fish and chips.  It all seems to cost more than it should; but I don't mind if I am supporting a local business.  The only thing I will remember is to face away from the kitchen space; because you can see everything they are doing in there; it's a bit unnerving and I don't care for having to ask for a key to the restroom.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I will start by saying I have never been to the UK but I have had my fair share of Fish & Chips at several places.  Service was great; tried a couple beers and decided on the Speckled Hen on Nitro. Delicious brew(for a non-stout!) Went for a basic Fish & Chips(small) and a Beef & Kidney Pie!  Took a little time to come out which is fine because I know it was made to order. Fish was simple; but not over-breaded or over-fried. Chips were great! Little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The Beef & Kidney pie was yummy!!! Perfectly flaky crust and great flavor. BE CAREFUL!!!! This thing is hot!!!!! Cut it in 1/2 and leave it alone for at least 5-7min they bring it to you right out of the oven!  They have a very nice looking menu with several seafood and meat and even curry options. Super local to me; a place I will definitely go back to! Friday/Saturday all you can eat Fish and Chips for $12.95 and Happy Hour  from 3p-6p with a nice discount on beers!,1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Been here a few times in the past. Once when they first opened. On my last visit the place was bigger and now serving alcohol. Maybe that is the best way to enjoy this place to the fullest?  This is a British style restaurant with Fish and Chips the way they make it back home. My Son-in-law is from England and he LOVES this place. They have several popular items that you would get overseas. Mushy Peas; Bangers / Mash / Gravy; Bubble/Bangers/Beans and many others.  Inside is decorated with everything you would expect if you were vacationing in GB. They also have a nice market with items that you may not find in your typical grocery store.  We have had the Cod; Haddock; Jalapeno Poppers (LOL) and looking forward to possibly trying the Walleye in a future lifetime.  The food is somewhat bland tasting to my palate. Maybe that is how they like it over there. The fish seems a little more greasy than we would prefer and a napkin is needed to soak up the excess. Hmmm?  Service is friendly and the dining experience and menu are worth checking out. Would have to say that there are better places for Fish in my opinion. But then again ... this is how they do it over in the Queen's backyard. TALLY HO!  3 STARS,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,we have been driving by this place for years but just stopped in for the first time.  Wow we really should have come sooner.  This place is great.  everything we ordered exceeded my expectations.  The menu is much bigger then I expected too.  Come here you will like it.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Unlike other fish 'n chips places in the city; this one offers other British fare as well: bangers and mash; bubble and squeak; and more (see the menu board pic I posted). I ordered the small cod and small order of fries; plus a crab cake. The fries were cut a bit thicker than you would find at most fast food places (this does have the look of a fast food joint; except for the bar area). I had anticipated mediocre fries at most; having previously read some of the reviews here; but  the batch I got was quite good; crispy outside; moist and tender within. The same description could be applied to the fish - except that the battered cod was swimming in oil; and the fries were not. The crab cake was a good size - about the size of the palm of a hand - and just as thick; had lots of crab meat but also quite a bit of surimi (imitation crab) as an extender. That was OK; it still tasted good and I like surimi. Like the fish; though; it was drenched in oil. I'm thinking of coming back to try the other fare; or even the fish and crab cake again - they're tasty and not expensive. I just need to take the precaution of letting a paper napkin soak up much of the oil first.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Roy 'The Hungry Englishman'  For those of you who are in a rush then my 'Five Star' rating says it all; this place is the best and importantly the most AUTHENTIC 'Chippy' that I have yet to find in the US.  However as is usual with my reviews I feel a little more in-depth comments are warranted so if you feel so inclined here you go.  As you have likely guessed from my moniker I am English born and bred; although  I must say it is my very good fortune to now call this wonderful country my home.  To the surprise of my (American) wife I don't get homesick at all but it is true to say that I do occasionally crave the odd bite or two that I grew up on; fish and chips included.  To this end my ever thoughtful wife has always been keen to find me an 'authentic' fish & chip restaurant as we travel this great country and I can say that finally we found one at the Codfather in Phoenix Arizona of all places.  I have tried so called 'authentic' British fish & chips all over the country and although most have been a very pleasant meal 'authentic' they were certainly not.  For one thing if you mention 'mushy peas' they look at you rather strangely whereas this is likely one of the most common sides you can get at every single 'chippy' in good old Blighty.  And don't get me started on the battered fish (or lack there of)....aside from the batter being wrong so called 'authentic' British fish & chip restaurants here in the US are under the misguided illusion that two 'finger' sized portions of fish is the thing to offer; when anyone who has ever eaten the real thing knows that one always gets a large filet of fish (usually hanging over the edge of your plate).  Anyway enough of my ranting on about all the places that are getting it wrong and let me chat about the ONLY place I have yet found that is getting it totally RIGHT..namely the Codfather.  What can I say.....FINALLY...a real Chippy..!  The place is very unpretentious but pleasant and comfortable; I think the lady owner is British as I heard an accent in the background and sadly the opportunity to introduce myself didn't arise (perhaps next time; cuz you know I'm going back).  I ordered my standby old favorite (fish; chips & mushy peas) and I was not disappointed; everything was just like I grew up on; totally authentic; so much so I over stuffed a little and couldn't eat for the rest of the day.  The 'chippy' also has a little British grocery section in; so I took advantage and stocked up on a few goodies.  It is also worth pointing out that the price for the meal was very reasonable indeed.  This I found very pleasing as growing up in a poor neighborhood with not much money as a kid; fish & chips was always a cheap meal  (hence the phrase 'cheap as chips').  Perhaps Americans won't find the real British fish & chips to their taste and that's okay but if you really do want to experience the real thing then this is the place to go.  Whenever my wife and I travel down to Phoenix (about every six weeks) we are going to make it a priority to have our lunch at the Codfather.  I would like to say a sincere 'well done' to the proprietors for a great experience and creating a genuine bit of Britain here in the US.        Happy eating; Roy,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,We eat here a lot; and love the food!  No matter how busy the place is; the service is good and the staff is friendly.  Try the all you can eat cod on the weekends...you'll be busting at the seams when you leave!,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I was born & raised in New England; Moved to the San Francisco Bay Area; visited the UK  and later lived on Maui ;Hawaii so I know good fish & chips. I can speak with some authority when I say here in Phoenix good fish & chips is hard to find.   The good news is The Codfather Fish and chips is the way it was meant to be made.  A large crispy coating; and fries deep fried to perfection.  If you are looking for this classic dish; you will not find a better place than the Codfather. GIANT piece of fried fish and it was delicious. Crispy; soft; juicy; flavourful; perfect with a little vinegar. Amazingly delicious. the chips were golden; fluffy; crispy on the outside but not so much that they can't absorb a generous amount of malt vinegar. For the price; could you really ask for more  My wife & I ordered the cod; which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency; while still maintaining the moist fish.     FOOD: I ordered the cod; which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency; while still maintaining the moist fish. I can say that the fish was fresh and the oil that it was cooked in was clean. The fish was fresh as it didn't taste fishy. The fries were lightly fried and it didn't taste too oily which was a good thing. The The chips were delicious ! PRICE: For the price; could you really ask for more.CONCLUSION:  Grab that malt vinegar and pour it on; because this fish and chip stop is the one to enjoy.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"The fish they use is high quality; you can see and taste it but that is about it for positive comments. We went on the 1st Friday of Lent and the place was packed. We saw a 2 top table at the bar so we grabbed it. The table was greasy and dirty; complete with a dollop of tartar sauce smack dab in the middle. The miserable bartender sluggishly came over and took our order. I guess we had to run a tab since we were sitting in the bar area bc she took our credit card when we ordered. No big deal except she when she brought it back she slapped it down right on top of the tartar sauce spill left on the center of the table. She either didn't notice or didn't care that the table was filthy bc she never wiped it down for us and she was so ornery looking we were afraid to ask her to do it for us. We were not in a crazy hurry to eat but the people around us were getting restless. Apparently; some of them had been waiting for over an hour for their order. Now; I try to be as understanding as possible but seriously? It doesn't take that long to fry fish. The nasty bartender just replied to the complaining customers that the kitchen got slammed with orders and it was taking a long time. No apology just an excuse. Ok; I get it ;they got hit with a bunch of orders at once. They were busy; I understand;  it was the first Friday of Lent but of course they were busy!!!! It is a fish restaurant on the 1st Friday of Lent! One would think that the owners would have planned their staffing a bit differently. We got our food and the bf loved his but mine was cold. On the way to the bathroom; I nearly slid to my death on a smashed french fry  or \chip\"" because none of the staff bothered to pick it or any of the other trash up off the floor. The bathroom is locked and you have to get a key (on a hanger) from the cashier. What kind of legit restaurant locks their bathroom like a gas station? The place is disgusting; the service is terrible; and the food is inconsistent. I don't think we'll be making a follow up trip to the Codfather.""",0

The nasty bartender just replied to the complaining customers that the kitchen got slammed with orders and it was taking a long time. No apology just an excuse. Ok; I get it ;they got hit with a bunch of orders at once. They were busy; I understand;  it was the first Friday of Lent but of course they were busy!!!! It is a fish restaurant on the 1st Friday of Lent! One would think that the owners would have planned their staffing a bit differently. We got our food and the bf loved his but mine was cold. On the way to the bathroom; I nearly slid to my death on a smashed french fry  or \chip\"" because none of the staff bothered to pick it or any of the other trash up off the floor. The bathroom is locked and you have to get a key (on a hanger) from the cashier. What kind of legit restaurant locks their bathroom like a gas station? The place is disgusting; the service is terrible; and the food is inconsistent. I don't think we'll be making a follow up trip to the Codfather.""",0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"My Wife and I went yesterday around 11:45 a.m. for lunch with high expectations... That was our first error... The second was ordering food... As a teenager many many years ago I worked at a place called Bit Of England Fish and Chips in Tarzana Ca. Well the best thing eaten yesterday were the Malt Vinegar Onions... They were great; but that's where the greatness ENDS... We ordered the Onion Rings and my wife said;\Do you taste any onion? I know it was there but tasteless. The batter was light. Then we ordered a Large order of Cod And Catfish... The Chips(fries) were good. The Fish had a taste; unfortunately it was a taste of grease and no fish taste. The Catfish was a little better than the Cod. There was a greasy film left in my mouth that was a lingering memory. Still no one beats Pier 83 or George and the Dragon...service was good; but don't understand why they incur labor cost of a wait staff when you should be able to walk up to a counter and order.. Another 15%-18% wasted... If service is decent or good we never penalize the wait staff for lousy food; they didn't cook it...""",1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,My wife was in a mood for fish & chips; and with the closing of Chuy's (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-_LMicC814) we haven't had a good place for a fish fry.  I searched for Fish & Chips on Yelp and found The Codfather.  I went to England on business last year and I was struck by how British restaurant this place looks.  It was clean but well-worn in a kind of homey way.  Looking past the decor; I noticed the wide-ranging collection of ales and stouts from all over the UK. I asked what beers were on tap and the girl started with Boddington's.  She didn't get any further.  If you haven't tried one; do it.    I went in planning on fish and chips; but then I saw bangers and mash (sausage and mashed potatoes with onion gravy) on the menu.  Wife ordered the cod and chips.  When our orders arrived; wife found the cod flaky and well battered; but a bit greasy.  The bangers and mash were flavorful; but heavy on the salt.  I'd have liked the potatoes better if they had lumps -- I suspect they were instant.  We'll probably go back; sometime but Wife is still missing her favorite fish at Chuy's.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"Food was a 4 Decor was a 3 Music on Tuesday 4.5  Hey; I stopped by this authentic British Fish N Chips joint last night and was surprised that I could not find a spot near the restaurant  entrance to park at the parking lot was full and this was a small strip center on Bell road with retail and service stores that were all closed. The place was relatively full for a Tuesday night at 7PM...more on that.  Since I felt like having authentic \Fish and Chips\"" the very nice lady behind the counter says \""What kind of fish\""? They have traditional Cod and Halibut and Salmon and Corvina. Plus Shrimp and Scallops and a lot more.Well in as much as I have been trying to minimize the fried foods in my life; I felt that I was down a Quart of Oil....so what the heck. Hey I just ran the 1/2 marathon last week; so go for it.   Had a piece of cod and the scallops as well and an order of onion rings. I must say; I was impressed with the fish and scallops. Very crispy cod and a nice portion as well. I had 10 scallops ($6.00) which are scallops and nothing else but for $6.00. Pretty good.  Was not impressed with the miniscule serving of tartar sauce and it's $.25 extra per serving (about a tablespoon). Well I must admit I like a little fish with my Tartar sauce. Don't get me wrong; I was impressed with the flavor of the food. I guess I just had too much oil. Maybe that's why I did not like the onion rings as much. They were good but by now; I reached my limit of oil.Again; fish is expensive and these portions were very nice.  Here's the biggest surprise and would have given The Codfather another 1/2 star if Yelp allowed half stars which I guess they don't. It's open mike Tuesday and there was a pretty decent band playing. 4 pieces; Banjo; bass; 2 guitars. After a few sets; a duet with a gal and guitar and a guy playing a mandolin were next. Pretty good; gave the place a nice buzz; people were listening and it was an added bonus to my Tuesday meal.   Finally....Thursday night these Brits open it up to an Irish Band (Raic) and I'm going to go...for some food and music. A very nice surprise in N. Phoenix. They might get to 4 stars soon.   all the best""",1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I've been here 4 times before they had full-service & now with the friendly service staff. Each time we've been there; food has always been the best.  I can also get my Horlicks malted milk from the little but well stocked UK products corner.  Our favorite is the Haddock and Cod fish & chips. Mushroom appetizer and the Clam Chowder.,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,The Codfather is my new neighborhood spot. I love this little place; and for many good reasons.  I'm huge on service; and am not afraid to indulge in food and beverage alone and therefore; I usually elect to sit at the bar most places. The Codfather is no exception.   Meet Jordan. He is always quick to greet me with a smile; and after my first visit he has remembered my drink order each time. Never an empty drink; and not just mine. This guy knows what he's doing behind his small; but always busy bar. Not long after my first sip; I'm greeted by Mark. Mark; owns the joint. You can usually find him chatting with; and greeting guests near the bar.   Great fish and chips. The jalapeno poppers are my favorite to snack on here; made in house; huge and cheesy! Killer happy hour with includes $2 domestic bottles and $1 off pints; which is a nice selection to choose from.   Great atmosphere; awesome service; good food; and nice price points. Not to mention a pretty cool eclectic group of regular guests. Overall; just a good spot. Keep it up Mark and Jordon!,1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I had a hankering for some fish and chips and this place hit the spot. We went early around 3:30 and not a soul was inside. I was a bit concerned about this but we ordered the Cod fish and chips; as they had an assortment of fish to select from; and we ordered some onion rings. The onion rings were amazing! They had this seasoning that they could have battered everything in and I would have been A-Ok. The fish and chips were also very decent quality. They have a small European food market type of thing and some interesting menu items if you are into English food like bangers and mash. The staff was polite and attentive. I'm sure ill be back the next craving i get.,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"Fish had no flavor; Chips were soggy and tasted strange.  Took my order to the counter and said that is was terrible.  The young woman replied; \we don't give refunds\"".  She didn't offer something else or ask what was wrong.  Never going back.""",0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Went here for lunch today with a couple of friends.  They seem to be big fans of this place.  2 of us ordered cod and chips and one ordered tilapia (he was not very pleased with the tilapia and vowed to stay with cod in the future)  They brought a bowl of complimentary potato chips to the table. I didn't time it but it seemed to me that it took a little too long for our order to come out.  I didn't think the food was particularly tasty; but the tartar sauce made it better; I also asked for some lemon I also think the food needed some salt; which may be good for those limiting their salt intake.  We asked for split checks and that was OK (nice of places suitable for lunch to be flexible with split checks); and  I almost missed to notice our server charged me for a drink when I had only water. They fixed it but it took a little while (probably over 5 minutes)  I won't probably come here on my own but if I the guys want to come over for lunch again; I will be back.  Oh; for beer fans; they seem to have a very good variety (about 60),0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"We hit this place on a Saturday night around 8p. There is a restaurant side and a bar side that is divided in a very awkward way. Plus in the restaurant; it looks like it is counter service; but it was sit down service. I actually don't have a preference between the two  as long as the food is good. We have all had subpar food from a sit down place and great food for a counter place. My only point in bringing this up is that the whole layout of the place is just weird. It could really use a makeover.  Now getting to the food-I went with a small fried haddock; chips (i.e. Fries); and mushy peas. It has been a few years since I have been to England or Ireland so I can't make a good comparison as to what you would get over there. But I can say that I really enjoyed the food I got. The fish was nice and meaty; the batter was tasty; and the malt vinegar at the table had a nice zing to it that seems to be missing from the regular grocery store malt vinegar you can get here. My old lady had the beef sheppards pie.  Ironically; I thought the sheppards pie looked very nice; but tasted average; while the presentation on my fish and chips was not good but it tasted very nice. I would have liked for the fish to come in a basket; lined with paper; that sort of thing. Just to make it look like something they are proud to serve (which they absolutely should be-again; it was very good). With it being on a plate; it just kind of comes off as \look-here's your damn fish\"".  One other thing-the small portion is really a perfect size as the large is huge. Even though it was all fried food; I didn't feel like I was overloaded and would have my stomach angry at me.  They scored big points with me by having Murphy's on tap here; and it tasted great. For those of you not in the know; Murphy's is to the city of Cork; Ireland what Guinness is to the rest of Ireland. No; I can't say which is better because I have never tasted them side by side. But you can get Guinness on tap in a million places; and I have never seen Murphy's on tap outside of Ireland.  They do have the area of items you can buy. Many of them you could probably find in World Market; but I imagine not everything.  To sum up; I think they have the main things correct in the fish; chips and Murphy's. It would be great if they made some cosmetic changes to the restaurant and the presentation of the food. This place is nowhere close to where we live; but I am sure we will be back.""",0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I came here with my wife and daughter for a late lunch on the 6th.   We have been itching to get some good fish and chips and this place fit the bill. I had been here before ages ago and remembered it as being very good. Luckily; my memory was good. This place was awesome!  My wife ordered the small fish and chips and I had the large; although I was tempted by the all you can eat deal they had at the time. Our daughter had chicken strips off the kids menu.  What we learned was that the small fish and chips is not enough! The food leaves you wanting more. The cod was well prepared and the batter was delicious. The fries were even good!  The chicken also looked very good. I didn't try any but my wife ate a piece the next day when we were snacking on leftovers. She said it was still incredibly delicious and would love to try it fresh next time.  Service was very good as well and the restrooms were the cleanest I've seen.   We can't wait to return.,1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"Homey atmosphere; very good selection of beers with European selections. Okay customer service but high turnover but terrible food hygiene. Worst yet; denial by the owner that it couldn't possibly be theirs even when you see a young gentleman in the back with long hair (in his defense he was wearing a hairnet but the hair was in the batter). Absolutely zero address to the hair that was fried in with the fish to us. They did ask if I wanted another serving as I declined with a grimace but they still had the audacity to charge me full price. After I told them \c'mon at least take off the fish; the owners disputed amongst themselves again of what to do; really loud so I can hear them as they look at me. Then the wife comes up to the register rings up a new check and leaves; again not a word; no apology. The new guy that's only been there two weeks tells me the new amount is 20% off excitedly yet NO APOLOGY! This place cannot afford to compensate fish much worse any apologies whatever happened to good ole customer service?   PS. My husband and I initially believed their denial \""it's not us we don't have long hair\"" till the long hair dude came out he said he didn't have a hairnets at all at that time!""",0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Divey kind of place for authentic standard English pub fare. Has my favorite English ciders and ales; which are hard to find in the desert. Fries are the homemade type; but not overly greasy. Fish is good; we had a fish and chips plate for $8.90 and were offered a couple of shrimp for a $1 more.. THAT didnt impress. The shrimps were ''shrimpy''; as in tiny and not tasty. Also shared the standard pub bangers and mash. Very good and like I had in London. The ambience; umm ; not pubby. The bar; not great.. BUT its what you want when you want it. Staff was awesome; maybe a bit slow; (the lady ordered after us got the same thing and got her order about 10 min before we did).. Again; its a place for your yang for English fare and brew..,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"The Codfather is another great strip-mall find! This one is on 16th St. &  Bell.  It's an interesting style of joint. Seems to be part take-out; part sit-in; part pub; part mini-grocery. You can run in and get some fish n' chips to go; or sit down and have them bring your order to you on real plates; with your ale in real pint glasses (16oz not imperial pints). There's even some gaming in an adjoining area. Billiards; anyone? [More...]  The cod was excellent. Heavy fillets battered up and fried crisp.  A little bit greasy; but I suppose if it was wrapped up in newsprint - it would be perfect. Fries are large and fresh. A little on the limp sde; but they sure beat the stuff fast food joints call fries. They even make sure to give you thescrap batter chips along with the fries and fish. That's the best part of \chips\"" in my opinion. Of course malt vinegar is on the tables - you have to walk to get ketchup if you choose to do that to your fries.  Too bad we were both in the mood for cod; because we didn't bother to explore the menu; which is pretty much typical English fare. Bangers n' mash (or squeak); sausage rolls; scotch eggs; shepherd's pie...and they offer daily specials of different fish; shrimp; scallops and other goodies. They have happy hour too 3-6p  if you want to toss back a few pints of their awesome selection of import beers on draught or in bottle!  Even though it was almost closing time on a Sunday - the staff was congenial and helpful. Because it was almost closing time we didn't bother to really check out the game room nor the selection of British foods; candies and trinkets available behind the bar. We will save that for our next trip...which will be soon.  4 Stars.""",1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,They no longer carry Guinness Draught. It has been replaced with Murphy's Irish Stout ($3/pint by the way). If ordering on the restaurant side; the cashiers are always underage; so they can never advise you on specialty beers available. Not a huge deal - but if you are stopping in for a pint; it's probably easier to sit on the bar side.   I also wish this place offered table service rather than ordering at the counter. Again; another reason to sit at the bar; I suppose.  Fish n chips still good!,0

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Great Great fast Serice even if it was a bit crowded. I ordered salmon and cod small order with chips and cole slaw.  Two med sized salmon and 1 large cod  Awesome Awesome first time here I shall return.  The flavor was fresh with the deep fried crunch. Yummy if you crave fish with a crunch.  The fish did not get soggy and kept its crunch through out my meal.  Chips were super and the cole slaw was out of this world...they do something something to keep it crunchy.  Super selection of ciders.  I will need to try the rest of the menu. Well worth the trip from way up north.,1
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I decided to give this place a try. We had a coupon so why not? I ordered the fried cod and chips and my husband ordered the mahi mahi. We a few shrimp and some onion rings as well. The decor is simple. The place felt a bit warm inside; but it was clean. They have an all u can eat fish fry on fridays.  I just got the large cod and chips plate. It came with 2 meaty; crispy pieces of fish and I did not care for the chips.  But then; I am not a french fry gal anyway. The fish was not greasy and perfectly battered. The tartar sauce is ok. a bit on the sweet side. My husband really enjoyed his mahi mahi with cocktail sauce. I thought the cocktail needed more of a kick; but it was fine.  I LOVE the garlic onion rings. It is a must if you go. Every table had a order of them so i figured they must be good and ordered them. I am glad we did! The dipping sauce is tasty too! If your in the area for some decent grub. Stop in. The service is friendly and the gal at the counter was helpful if you had any questions. They also serve curry;pasties;sweets and much more.,1

58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I had lunch here and we ordered the fried zucchini as an appetizer that was yummy but the cod with chips was overly greasy; the grease is still stuck to my pallet. Sorry to say but Pete's fish and chips is better.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Why are there two listings on Yelp for this place?  Ever since my trip to Europe last March 2008; I get a hankering for real beer-battered fish and chips now and then. This pairing is not complete in my mind until you serve it with a steaming hot side of mushy peas. As it would turn out; mushy peas are hard to come by here in the desert; but I am not one to give up so easily. (Rosie's; by the way; doesn't have this buttery little delicacy; reminiscent of Linda Blair on a particularly possessed and angry day.) To my sheer delight; The Codfather did not disappoint! Though just a bit mushier than I remember them being across the ocean; these mushy peas are seasoned well and have a nice buttery flavor.  There are a variety of fish on the menu for your liking. I had the 4 oz. portion of the traditional cod and found it to be more than enough; good flavor and good texture. It sat atop a modest portion of soggy chips in a plastic basket lined with wax paper and was served with a small serving of tartar sauce in a clear plastic bucket with a lid (cocktail sauce was an option too). My husband had the 7 oz. portion of sea bass served on a plate and I did not like it as much - it was a bit too soggy throughout. After tasting my cod; he said he wished he had ordered the same instead.  SAVING GRACES: Fun mementos throughout! The Union Flag; a photo of the Queen; Charles and Diana; a double decker bus; a sign for Picadilly Circus...The menu! Everything British; from Scottish Eggs to Cornish Pasties; Even the dessert is fried; so go elsewhere if you're recovering from your bypass surgery.  GRIPES: Greasy fish & chips difficult to eat in the small plastic basket - a plate would have been helpful. Need patience to squeeze out enough ketchup from the little packets on the tables. Being environmentally minded and too hungry to waste time tearing open 10 little ketchups; a refillable squeeze bottle would have been great. They use them for the hot sauce instead...a little misleading. Stingy serving of tartar sauce served with all portion sizes of fish. Extra sauces will cost you .25 cents each. More like a diner and less like a pub.  Imagine! A little taste of nostalgia only 5 minutes from my house. And at under $10; my husband is thrilled at the money we're saving now that I don't have to buy an international plane ticket in this economy.  If it's mushy peas you're looking for; you've come to the right place! If  you can do without; hit Rosie McCaffrey's for the best fish and chips in town with the ambience of an international pub.,0
58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I finally found a British restaurant in the North Valley and what wonderful fish and chips.  I've eaten in other Phoenix British oriented restaurants; but the fish in this small; unique place is the best.  I went to Southend; England last fall and had fish and chips; I can honestly say; it was a perfect match to The Codfather fish; very good.  You'll want to try all their various dishes and specialty items; but be careful with the sausage rolls; they make the sausage fresh every day and you end up taking several home with you.  They have now opened their Pub; attached to the restaurant with various brands of ale and beer.  You'll find this a perfect reminder of the UK; they also have carry-out and you can order large meals to go also.  Try it; you'll really love it and don't forget the salt and malt vinegar; the non-English will probably ask for tartar sauce.,0
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,How quickly things change! It is a sad day. The man that has run Itchi Bowl for a long time is gone. He has sold out.  We won't be back. The simple teriyaki chicken and rice bowl is gone. They have replaced it with ball of sticky rice and a separate spoon full of chicken. It is hard to believe the food quality could drop so fast but it has. Less quantity; did not taste as good. We even were shorted on our take out order. Hopefully they will figure it out quickly.,0
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,"I stopped in once for a quick bite of cheap sushi.   This is a converted fast food place of some kind in a strip shopping center. Counter service; lots of seating; and unfortunately a horrid stench. I've smelled this same distinctive odor in a Blimpy's in another city; so it makes me wonder if it's some kind of cleaning chemical that isn't being rinsed off or something. The odor gets worse when you go into the raised dining area.  The 2 stars instead of 3 is for the horrid stench.  Anyway... There were only 2 customers. The guy at the counter was nice. I ordered 2 rolls and a drink \for here\"" for about $10 total... cheap.  The rolls tasted ok. Better than grocery store pre-pack; but cost a little less. They were maybe the quality you'd get on a cheap asian buffet... and they were cheap.  The problem is the rolls are cut and then the pieces are layed flat in a circle smooshed together in a small plastic food-service clear containier. The result is they don't come out in whole pieces. The fall apart when you try to remove them; so you eat crumbled sushi... but they were cheap.  Would I go there again? Maybe; for takeout; and to try some other things; since the price is low. I might buy the sushi instead of picking up a pre-pack of california roll at the store if I was driving by. Maybe... if I was feeling cheap.""",1
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,"I stopped in once for a quick bite of cheap sushi.   This is a converted fast food place of some kind in a strip shopping center. Counter service; lots of seating; and unfortunately a horrid stench. I've smelled this same distinctive odor in a Blimpy's in another city; so it makes me wonder if it's some kind of cleaning chemical that isn't being rinsed off or something. The odor gets worse when you go into the raised dining area.  The 2 stars instead of 3 is for the horrid stench.  Anyway... There were only 2 customers. The guy at the counter was nice. I ordered 2 rolls and a drink \for here\"" for about $10 total... cheap.  The rolls tasted ok. Better than grocery store pre-pack; but cost a little less. They were maybe the quality you'd get on a cheap asian buffet... and they were cheap.  The problem is the rolls are cut and then the pieces are layed flat in a circle smooshed together in a small plastic food-service clear containier. The result is they don't come out in whole pieces.

mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,Must be nice to have a place where your hours of operation are just a suggestion. Got home from work at about 8 pm; check to see what their hours are. Online says they close at 9; so I get my shoes on and head over. I get there at about 815 and as I'm walking up to the door the man (owner I think) locks the door and just smiles at me. Worst service I've gotten in a long time.,0
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,"Who would know this little place ever existed?!  It is so eloquently hidden in the corner of strip mall that has gone to shit.  Being the person that I am; I decided to try this place out (why does it seem like I am always reviewing Asian Cuisine?  This is beyond me).  What a pleasant surprise!  To start; my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE thing about this place is the guy behind the counter; who I am guessing is the owner.  I think he just may be the reason I continue to come back.  Usually; we place orders over the phone for take-out; and I love to hear his familiar and peculiar voice on the other end; repeating my order back to me.  It's as if he smiles ALL the time!  I do not think I have ever seen this guy in a bad mood; not once!  On to the food; pricing; blah blah blah.  JK.  For the price range; this food is excellent.  I am a personal fan of the gyoza; passion iced tea; and your basic (and not so professional in terms of the \sushi\"" world) Alaskan roll and California roll.  They are very affordable and generally taste amazing.  For the balla on a budget: go with the Bento dish.  It has EVERYTHING you could ever ask for in a meal: teriyaki chicken over steamed veggies and rice; edamame; california rolls; eggroll; spicy beef over salad (which by the way has an amazing sauce).  I can't quite remember if anything else comes with it.  It is only $6.25!!!  I could not even finish the whole meal for lunch on my own.  Other items of interest: if you get your meal to go; be sure to ask for the red spiced pepper seasoning salt.  I think I sprinkle this on everything I get from there.  If you eat inside; they have them at the tables.  Which; speaking of the inside; it is a little odd.  They have random poles near the cash register...ODD.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  I have not tried much of the other food; but from what my friends and co-workers say; it has been delicious every time (especially the Kalbi steak).""",1
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,The owners are extremely nice here. Polite and friendly. The food is just barely average however. I would NOT order sushi here and I doubt I would return.,1
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,Used to love this place and would drive from Goodyear to eat here. Today I discovered they no longer serve the one thing that made me drive all the way across town to eat here. They no longer have the Katsu Bowl which was awesome and what my whole family would order when we went.  The food isn't bad but now there is nothing on the menu to make the drive worth while as their are better Teriyaki places out there. I'll miss my Katsu Bowl.,0
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,Ichi Bowl is a Japanese/Korean fast food Resturant that offers some delicious options to choose from.   Some of the main dishes include Teriyaki Chicken and Salmon; Orange Chicken; Spicy Beef; Vegetables and Noodles. They even proudly serve Bento (combination).  There are low carb options; salads; and Sushi. Some side dish options and Pepsi products to wash everything down.  Be sure to come during happy hour from 11:00am until 1:00pm to get a $2.75 Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. That is a daily special any business crowd would enjoy to dine at during lunch. Plus the service is super fast.   When I checked in I was offered a free medium drink with purchase. Unfortunately the man at the registered told me they no longer offer that special. He went ahead and granted it this time. Just wanted to warn you fellow YELPERS that it may not be honored.,1
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,If it weren't for the crackheads wandering around outside I would consider this place my new go to. The orange chicken puts Panda to shame. My boyfriend liked the spicy beef bowl. Service was quick; prompt and courteous. I just wish it was in a slightly better area - I live in the central corridor but this spot seemed super sketch to me.   i will definitely be back...but I'll probably bring mace!,1
mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,I used to frequent this place like 2 or 3 times a week.  Then one night I call up and it rang for 2 minutes. No one picked up.  I hang up and call back.  After about 30 seconds the owner picks up and I tell him who it is and what I want.  (he knows me from all the business I give him).  He tells me that they close at 730.  It was 7:29; plus the fact that the phone was ringing for a couple minutes..there was no reason I should not have my order taken.  The biggest factor was my repeat business I gave this guy.    Bottom line:  I will never be back to this place.  Don't ever give anyone your business when they don't appreciate your business; particularly when they snub you before they even close!,0
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,Finally; something cool on this fairly dreadful but improving side of town.  In the new Metro Commons next to a new JOINT; Pot belly subs; Yogi's; a burger place I forgot the name of but there are a few of them around; and a soon to be new Yogurt shop; things are def. getting a little better out here.  Pizza is easy to order; kind of Subway-esque minus the dullness of an actual Subway. Ordered a couple different; one just pepperoni and one the Chicken Calexico?  Quite good; and wood fire oven fresh.  Crust was thin and crispy; a little burnt here and there just how I like it (TWSS).  The vibe is laid back with patio seating overlooking the scenic Peoria avenue rush hour traffic.  A stay pigeon also found this place; he was munching on some gluten free crust tossed away by a fairly overweight female patient; I mean customer.  Also they have a lovely devils ale on tap.  Totally cool.  Good to see a few fresh kind of hipper places opening up around these here parts:),0
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,Love this place!! Very reasonable prices.  Came during lunch and they were very good at getting order out fast.,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,Poor customer service. Last time the mega was cut into sixes. This time I got it cut in fours and asked for it to be fixed. Was told to wait while she finished cutting and boxing other pizzas. I finally walked away. They seem disorganized. I got two super large slices and two small slices. Tasted good though.,0
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,"I came here on a Friday evening about 6:15. The place has a nice vibe; the employees are friendly; and the prices are wonderful.  I ordered The Jasper and one of the strawberry desserts. The ingredients tasted fresh and everything had a good flavor.  I'm giving the place two stars because the crust was terrible. It was extremely \chewy.\"" It was like putting a tortilla in the microwave for 5 minutes. The crusty just ruined it for me. I always like thin crust pizza...but they usually are a bit crispy. This one tasted cheap (which it was!).  I am glad I tried the place; but I have no desire to go back...and won't.""",0
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,We went tonight on a busy Friday after work.  The pizza was very good; made to order; affordable; and fast.  The toppings selections were unlimited and I was glad to see salad options and a variety of drinks.  My only complaint; and maybe I'm just getting old; is that the music is waaay tooo loud.  I had to shout to tell my order and the servers could barely hear me.  I wanted to ask questions about toppings but it was just so hard to hear and I got sick of literally shouting.  I hated having to just go along with whatever was happening with my pizza because I didn't want to fight the noise to customize my order.  Then when we sat to eat; it was constant banging noise in our ears.  I'm no prude; I love music; I love 80's music which seemed to be a theme; but my goodness it was just unbearable after a long day at work.  The business concept is good though.,0
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,I am updating my review based on our experience tonight.  We had 2 great mini pizzas with great service.  It was not as crazy busy; the music level was just right; and the front patio was open for a nice indoor/outdoor kind of vibe.  Also; we could people watch as randomness walked by.  Pizzas and drinks were very good; and being that it was not opening night; we really enjoyed the custom pizzas with less noise.  I think we will be back for the week day affordable food; quality beverages; friendly service; and outdoor seating.,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,The atmosphere is open and friendly. They use frozen pizza dough and yell your name once the pizza is done which is about 5 minutes. Besides that the pizza is tasty. The crust is cracker like but the toppings were full of flavor. Food is ordered Very similar to a chipotle but the food is not naturally raised meats and organic locally grown produce. Good not great...,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,Food is Awesome ; service is fast and friendly and affordable too. Great concept . I highly recommend this for any occasion.,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,Amazing pizza and amazing service. I love the fact that the dough is made from scratch. Byop and salad. Keep coming back for more.,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,Went here to try something new and had a bad experience but the pizza was great. The guy making my pizza had to ask me 4 separate times what I ordered which was mildly annoying but not a big deal. Then I noticed that he forgot what the guy in front of me ordered and put the wrong toppings on his pizza.   They were all out of basil too which was an ingredient on two of the three pizzas that I ordered. I would have hoped the guy making the pizzas would tell me they were out of basil when I ordered instead of after the pizza was made.   I felt they deserved three stars since the pizza was good (even without the basil) and the price seemed reasonable. The people however could use some help.,0

lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,"I loved the concept of this place! The red sauce was not my favorite; but the white sauce was delicious! You can get a mini pizza for around $5 with as many toppings as you want! The food would get 5 stars; but they lost a star for customer service. As soon as I walked in; the lady behind the counter was not friendly. I had never been here before and she did not seem willing to waste her time answering questions. The first thing she says to me is \red sauce and cheese?\"" I did not know what I wanted at that point; so I asked her if I could look first. She said \""okay; but you need to pick a sauce.\"" Yes; I know. She seemed to be in a hurry and there was nobody even behind me. Rude! They guy at the register was more patient and friendly. Overall; food was great and cheap and they have beer on tap; so I will be back. Just make sure you look over the menu before you arrive.""",0
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,This is the most f***g awesome pizza I ever had in USA!!!   OMG! Staff are pretty expert and friendly; thin crust; amazing ingredients; easy menu; nice beers; cool service!  I love it!,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,Guys;   I don't even know the name of manager so I'm not a relative :)   I'm from Beverly Hills and staying here in Phoenix for a while on a business trip.  Believe me; this place is gonna be a bucket list for Phoenix!  Easy menu; personalized menu; fresh ingredients smiling at you over counter; best draft beer collection; extremely friendly and expert staff; minimum waiting time; easy access from freeway; and most important; sweet memories here!  Here's my order: Red sauce with mozzarella cheese; Canadian bacon; mushroom; red onion; olives plus some fresh veggies and pesto after oven.   I'm sorry I couldn't wait to take a picture so I ate the first slice  I'm a fan of orange blossom beer!,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,"I had the \Calexico\"" pizza; it was delicious. This is wood fired pizza done right. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it's slightly confusing to order. You can get custom pizzas much the same way you would order at Subway or Chipotle. I picked the number I wanted but they still ask you if you want each ingredient on it. Simple enough; I just told them I want whatever comes with that number; I didn't see all of the toppings listed in the number available at the counter; but then I realized that the rest are \""finishers\"" which are applied after cooking and are available around the other side of the counter. Not really a big deal but now I know so I can try other finishers in the future. Staff was happy and friendly. They had a very small section of beer and wine on tap but I couldn't try them on my lunch break. I will be back!""",1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,For a DIY Pizza place I found the food here to be excellent.  The crust is great; the staff was helpful.  The choices of toppings are excellent. They have online ordering which I highly recommend since they are always busy.,1
lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,From the moment I walked in; their set-up looked a lot like Subway subs (adding toppings down the line as you please). So for that reason; I wasn't expecting high hopes on quality; taste; or both.   After my first order today; pizza is really delicious. You can either order custom pizzas that are already pre-made with Mod suggestions listed on the side wall with ingredients; or you can make yours custom right there on the spot. All the decisions and the wait time for the pizza to cook; took about 10min. They also have glass bottles of Fanta & Coca-Cola (real Mexican style) which I loved! All pizzas are thin crust; and I really wish I would have ordered a mini size. The next level up is the Mod size; and I could barely eat 3 out of the 4 slices. Keep in mind I'm a 30yr old 200 lbs 6 foot tall guy. I had my pizza with extra red sauce; mozzarella cheese; gorgonzola cheese; chicken; pepperoni; and salami. The price including the glass coca-cola bottle was $10.89. I know with fluctuations; prices are increasing; although I still feel it's a bit much; but again perhaps the Mod size was too big. I almost want to give it 5 stars.,0
YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,"This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff.

YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,I enjoy eating here several times a year. The dining room is clean and the staff friendly. The food is always prepared just right. This location never seems to get too crowded which is a good thing for me. I would give this particular location four stars but; I can't at this time because the staff working the drive through window at night have been dropping the ball in regards to order accuracy.,1

YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,The food at this location is decent; though we experienced terrible service from Ashleu Rutherford.  The dining room was an icebox; and when we complained; Ashley seemed annoyed but claimed she would turn the air down.  She never did and lied to our faces when we questioned her shortly thereafter... Will probably go to other locations in the future; where service is not such an issue.,0
YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,Yes it is fast food. But for a fast food place you have to give it exra stars because of the great service you get which sets it above other fast food burger places.  When you order to dine it they will bring to your table a condiments tray and ask you if you need anything else. No other fast food place does that.,1

YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,Whataburger is about as good as fast food burger quality gets. Freshly made when you order (which does slow down the fast a little). I personally NEED a Whataburger with cheese; bacon and jalapenos about once a month. I wish they stuck with the spicy ketchup.,0
YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,I know it's shocking; but I had never been to any Whataburger until a few months ago.  I've now been to this location twice.  The first time was after 9 pm; and we ate inside.  The burgers and fries were both pretty darn good.  The gal who brought us our food and offered condiments was very pleasant; too.  I really have not one complaint.  The second time was a complete fiasco.  22 minutes in drive-thru.  I tried not to get irritated as the end result would be a really good burger; made-to-order.  Well if this burger was made-to-order; I wasn't the one who ordered it.  I will say it was assembled-to-order; however.  Not only was it cold; but the cheese had never been melted and the lettuce & tomato were still refrigerator cold.  So assembled-to-order with an already cold patty.  The fries were only slightly better.  So my relationship with Whataburger was incredibly brief and is over...unless I'm hard up late night.  Then anything's possible.,1
YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,Great food that is made to order; I go inside everytime for that reason...fteah and as fast as fresh can possibly be.   P.S. the party melt with extra butter and onions is the bomb.,0
YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,This location gets 5 stars because of the manager Chris! My boyfriend and I took the survey after a visit and were dissatisfied.  Chris personally sent us an email to get back our loyalty of stopping by at his store; inviting us and guests for dinner. Not only was our whole bill covered; but he was sincere and genuine. He made it right and is an excellent example of customer service!  We now for sure will be back for being treated so good and feel valued as customers.,1
YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,I'm going to agree with an earlier post that that the wait time in the drive-thru can be a frustrating experience. A 10 to 20 minutes wait experienced in the last two visits is not acceptable.  I'm sure the food was made to order when I ordered it but with the wait time it was not in the fresh and made to order status by the time I received it.  This location needs to figure out a more efficient way to move people through the line such as having large orders or orders that take more than a few minutes pull off to a parking spot.  I would rate the burgers as better than average but a luke warm burger and cold fries negates all of that.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,Terrible. I really should have learned my lesson after the first time; so maybe I'm really to blame. Every damn time they mess up my order. Pretty sure they straight give me someone else's food. The fries ALWAYS taste like they were cooked yesterday; stale and cold. I've found more edible fries under the seat of my car.  What a waste. It shouldn't be this difficult to get a quick burger.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,Don't waste your time. I don't even eat there anymore due to the cold scrappy food; long wait times; and messed up orders.... It's happened every time I've ate their...

ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,I like this location because they always get my order right and if I park and order they are usually really quick. The drive-through tends to take a little bit longer so I always just park instead. I try to come during their happy hour between 2-4 to get half price drinks. I always order a cherry limeade with easy ice. Most places will throw a ton of ice in even if you ask for easy ice but this place doesn't!,1
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,This sonic is pretty bad when it comes to customer service. The window helper sounded like this was the last place she wanted to be and looked it as soon as I got to the window. I'm not expecting perky and perfect but friendly and alive would have done just find.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,I don't know why I continue to punish myself by coming here.  They have been consistently slow here for at least 8 months.  Save yourself time and head to the grocery store and buy the ingredients for whatever you planned on ordering and go home and cook it.  It will be faster and probably not be incorrect.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,"Do Not Eat Here! The service is terrible. The food is cold; smashed in a bag and pretty much thrown at you. When you get home the order is wrong.

I had called the store manager and he stated that same. Whatever happened to; sorry; can we offer to refund your money and here's your next lunch on us. We really appreciate your business. NOPE......not Sonic.

ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,Alrighty Sonic..... I have given you a few chances; because all of the other Sonics I go to I am pretty happy with. When its lunch time and I want something quick and easy you are usually one of my choices! This Sonic happens to be not too far from my work and home; but I will no longer be visiting..... I will drive out of my way to spend my money somewhere else. Not only have I gone here 3 times and been un happy with the food; the service...... is beyond ridiculous. Most Sonics are employed with younger high school kids...... lets get them to get their acts together specifically at this location. Each of my visits has ended with awful customer service; or just plain bad food. This last visit was the last straw for me! Throwing food out through the drive though window is unprofessional and rude; being rude and a smart patooty (yes I just said patooty) is also not appreciated and frankly absurd since your job at the drive through is customer service!!! These kids should be happy to have a job at all in this economy. After experiencing that I get to work to eat my food and..... YUCK is all I can say! The foot long chili cheese coney I received was inedible; I attached a wonderful picture of me picking through the hot dog as for the whole thing looked like this.... decide for yourself if you would eat it.  Needless to say I am pretty hangry and cant wait to get off work and enjoy fast food from any where else but Sonic.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,Well tonight I gave sonic another chance and it took over 10 minutes  to get our order and out of that line. To find out that they messed up the order and I don't get an apology instead I get irritated teenage girl. Not sure I'll be visiting anytime soon. The great thing is I'll be a lot healthier if I stay away from this fast food joint. And a lot happier without the attitude.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,Disappointing. We ordered two American dogs; a foot long coney dog and a regular NY dog. We asked to substitute the chili for onions and sour kraut on a foot long Coney dog. They said no. Really? I was quite surprised and a bit disappointed. When we paid there was a bit of attitude. No sorry we could substitute; no thanks for you business. To top it off the food was boring. Next time I will go to a hotdog cart.  I will not be back.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,So as you can tell from all the other reviews; this sonic is utterly terrible! They are the worst fast food customer service in town.  Tonight we waited almost 20minutes for 2 small blasts and 1 small burger.  First; the drive-thru was empty when we parked. by the time our order finally was brought up to our car; several cars had come and gone through.   Since they took forever with no reason; My girlfriend and I asked to talk to the manager; and after waiting a few more minutes he just gave us an excuse that they were training 6 new people.....on a Saturday night????  I don't think this guy even said sorry.   So we're done with this location.  I'd rather go to ANYwhere else.  I'd rather go to the sonic on Gilbert rd (maybe 10miles away).   Avoid this sonic after 8 too; the lines get HUGE.  We showed up at 730; and it was nearly 8 by the time we left.  The parking lot was still pretty empty; and they don't care....,0

ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,This location is the absolute worst! So slow; one time I was literally stuck in the drive thru for FORTY-FIVE MINUTES (sadly; I am not exaggerating even a little bit); trying to get my kids slushies in the summer! By the time I got them; they were just liquid! And I don't think they have ever gotten my order correct. A couple months ago; I went and ordered 3 plain dogs; with sauerkraut on the side (if you get it ON the dog; your whole bun is soaked). I get home; all three dogs had sauerkraut put on; then scraped off! There were bits of it all over the dog and the buns were soggy from the liquid. Wonderful; especially since two of the dogs were for my kids; who HATE sauerkraut.  For some odd reason; I decided to go again today. Ordered the same and the guy confirmed it was plain dogs... Get home to hot dogs slathered in relish; onions; ketchup and mustard. Really? How hard is it to give me a plain hot dog???? Aside from that; the dog was so overcooked; it tasted like vienna sausage jerky. So disgusting!   The one star is earned by the manager; because he quickly refunded my money when I called in today. I do appreciate that. I've learned my lesson; though; and will never return to this location; or any Sonic; actually.,0
ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,Horrible customer service. The past 3 or more times I have been there has been nothing but disappointment. Honestly it should be zero star rating. One of the times I was there; I sat and waited for my order to be taken for more than 7 minutes; when there was only one car in front of me. And while I was waiting during that time; 4; yes 4; employees walked over from the near by walgreens having a jolly good time apparently. I ended up driving off and not ordering because they would not take my order! The most recent time; I went to get a lemon berry slush. When at the window; I saw a girl put in a couple strawberries; put on the lid and shake it twice. As soon as it was handed to me I looked at it and immediately asked for it to be stirred up more because obviously from the complete white showing through the lid; it had not been mixed at all. The girl looked at me like I was crazy; closed the window; handed it to someone else; and then 3 employees proceeded to giggle and trade glances at me. They handed it back after a few seconds and big shock it looked the same. It's called a slush; not sugar water with strawberries on the side.  Again. Horrible service.  Normally sonic is one of my favorite places to go; but sadly I will not ever be returning to this location or maybe any sonic location again.  And it's not just me; every person I know that has gone there has had similar experiences.,0

ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,We stopped by this location around 9:25 pm; for a light meal. We ordered one sandwich; an order or fries; popcorn chicken; and ice cream. We sat talking in the car for awhile; and around 9:40 we realized it had been quite a long time. No one came to talk to us or even to take our money until 10 pm. That's right; it took over half an hour for four items. When we received our food; it was cold and the fries were half full. I asked the server to at least bring us some hot food as we had been waiting almost 40 minutes. All she offered was an apology and my ice cream (with no spoon) while she ran back for hot food. I expected at least more acknowledgment of our inconvenience; something. This was the most ridiculous service I've ever had; and having worked fast food for 8 years I feel that I am very understanding about mishaps and service problems. I will never return here.,0

WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,This In-N-Out isn't as busy as the ones in Chandler and Tempe; which is nice since you can get your order made quicker as a result. Service is fast and friendly like the others; and our animal style fries and burgers were piled on with toppings; very nice! It looked like they added more fries to our order than at the other locations; which I appreciated. The only negative for me was that the A/C here runs very cold; so the cheese on our fries congealed into a cold mass soon after we got our order. Boo for cold cheese on fries!,1

WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,The first time I ate the fries; I hated it. But then; I got used to them. Now; they taste really good! I eat at In-N-Out Burger so much. Food is usually healthier. It's relatively cheap. And Service is pretty good if the employees are competent.  I eat pretty healthy and I eat a lot. The best thing about this place is you can eat a lot in a healthy way for cheap. So just protein style hamburger (the custom order where they replace the bread with lettuce). Then just add extra onion; extra tomatoes and extra pickles for free. That's like a salad in itself. And for how much? $2.11 with tax. Not bad. ;)  If you really want to pig out; then order the animal style fries. It's not healthy. It has cheese and dressing and whatever they put in there. Or a 4x4 and some fries and shake. It's good. Just not healthy. But I love this place!,1

WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,This location hasn't been on point when taking orders via drive-thru. So if you're in a rush I would pass this location up.  Burgers and everything else is still good; but if I can't trust that my food comes out the way I ask and pay for... Then why bother going back.

WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,So I will first admit that I am a Southern Californian transplanted to Phoenix. So I am biased and I love In N Out Burgers and Fries   I order the #1 animal style. Which for those of you who don't know the secret language that is at In N Out; that is with grilled onions; lots of pickles and spread. Oh and today I learned something about the burgers being grilled with mustard. Who knew...not ME!!  Oh and I took an Newbie; an East Coast Newbie none the less today. Guess what?!?! She loved the burger...but not the fries! I really think the fries are an acquired  taste; especially if you are a McDonald's fry fanatic...All that fake beef flavoring is hard to compete with...ya know some people just like fake flavor...not the fresh cut and fresh cooked fries that are In N Out's   I get that In N Out is a regional burger place. I think that just because you don't understand the appeal doesn't mean it isn't good and has lots of people who love it...and at times CRAVE it!,0
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Did our Christmas Angel that day and stopped off to grab some quick food.   I like In-N-Out no matter where it's located. My only issue with this one is with the french fries. They must have been sitting in the tray waiting to be matched up with a burger order because  ours were limp.  Maybe I should order their twice cooked fries.,1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,I seriously do not get the appeal of this place!   I tried it quite a while ago back in California and didn't like it much. But everyone I know raves about it and it has been a while so I thought I'd try it again. Especially since it's so close to my house.   Blah. I got a cheeseburger with grilled onions; tomato; their sauce and pickles. I passed up lettuce because they use nasty iceberg lettuce. Can I get an upgrade? How about green leaf lettuce like is shown on their website? Also got fries and a Dr. Pepper. The Dr. Pepper was the greatest thing about the meal. OK; the service was good too. Very friendly; kinda creepily so.   The fries are just weird. I'm sure people say it's because they are fresh. OK; then I'll take un-fresh fries any day. These ones are just gross.   The burger is just nothing special. The flavor is not great. My burger wasn't even that warm by the time I got home; which is only a mile away. And it was 154 degrees inside my car. How does it get that cool in that quick of a time?   Again; another place I'll probably only return to for the Dr. Pepper. Clean place; good service; good energy; not so great food.,1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,I order a burger protein style and didn't realize how thin the patties are without the bun.  Next time I will order a double double or even a triple if possible.  There were more veggies than meat.,0
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,This was the first time I have ever been to a(n) in and out. Fast friendly service. Reasonable prices. Best burger I have gotten from a non mom and pop shop.  This in and out is by the fiesta mall; more off of alma school than southern.  Not a long wait in the drive thru either.. I will definitely go back!,1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,SIX STAR REVIEW: Everything you already love about in-n-out. Plus; one time my car broke down IN THE DRIVE THRU (facepalm; smh; embarrassing) and the employees didn't even HESITATE to come help me push it through (i mean it makes sense; they can't have a car blocking their drive-thru; that's bad for business was like 115 degrees that day and they ran out to help me!) So nice! Did you know they have a secret menu? Of course you did who cres have you seen their REGULAR MENU?? Actually i usually order a 4x4 or 5x5 cause I like to practice unhinging my jaw. Put fries on your burger. Eat it. Thank me later.,1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Love the fact that you can get filled up at one of these Burger joints and not let it break the bank. The food is always freshly made and the service is very friendly.  This particular location is in the Fiesta Mall parking lot and it can get pretty busy during peak hours. Usually get here before the lunch rush and eat quickly so I can get back to work in a hurry.  3X3 with Onions; add Pickles and Chili Peppers; please. Sometime I'll treat myself to an order of their tasty and freshly sliced French Fries. Definitely can't resist a giant pile of the spicy complementary Chili Peppers. Oh Yeah!  They have several ways that you can order your burger here. Just do a quick google for their Top Secret ordering instruction and you will be amazed. Animal style is a typical favorite and you will probably see a few during your visit.  See ya there next time and remember to enjoy the moment. Life is Good. SAY CHEESE!  3.75 STARS,1

WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Best burger around; but then I am favoritist to this place for a reason. Pricewise; they are decent and you actually get a combo; as opposed to Smashburger and Five Guys where their items are ala carte; hence you spend more money.   I am not a fan of cheese on hamburgers (yes; I know...I am WEIRD); therefore I order the #3 combo. Once in a while; I will either get the burger or the fries done Animal Style. Sometimes I will get a Strawberry Shake instead of a soda too. Their shakes are really good and hit the spot when it comes to sweetness for me. Usually it's the ice cold Diet Coke that lures me though. The only drawback for me is that they don't have Coke Zero. Coke Zero is my absolute drink of drinks and if it isn't offered; I resort to Diet Coke or once in a very blue moon; regular Coke or Dr. Pepper.  The service is pretty good although if it's super busy there may be a bit of a wait; but well worth it by the time you get your meal.,1

WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,"Clean; friendly service; delicious food. Everything that you'd expect from In-n-Out; w/ out the line!  I was very surprised that one a Saturday afternoon this place was practically deserted. We were greeted promptly; by just about the smiliest (thats a word; right?) guy Ive ever met. Our food was out w/in about 5 minutes of us leaving the counter; and of course it was delicious.  A much better choice than the \new\"" food court at Fiesta Mall.""",1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Fast service.  Good food.  Great milkshakes.  Unbeatable prices.,1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Every time I make it back to the West; I always stop here first. Favorite location bar none. Never disappointed no mater what time I visit. I can always count on the same warm fast pace service; amazing food; and the friendly staff. Love love love.,1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Like every other middle of the road In-N-Out burger joint I've ever been to--this one was full of all the same things: way too long of a wait; a simple and perfectly satisfactory burger; and some of the nicest dang kids running the place.  I was sent on an errand from someone else; which I don't mind. Sure; I'll pick you up a burger. What I didn't love; was the huge wait. I opted not to get in the drive-thru with 15+ cars ahead of me; and instead went in. I got my order in okay; but still sat there for the better part of a half hour to wait for two burgers and a shake.  Price isn't bad; but there are at least a dozen other places I'd go before In-N-Out that are more interesting. But hey brah; if it reminds you of your childhood; then go right ahead.,0
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Just when I think that we have enough burger joints and we need to axe 'em all; I go back and visit In-N-Out Burger! They are still tough to beat. Their fresh; never frozen burgers still keep me coming back. While all the new burger places claim some gimmick or another; In-N-Out just has good friendly service; great burgers; good fries (not my favorite; but still pretty decent) and a simple menu. They always keep the place nice and clean. The crowds speak for themselves!,1
WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,I went here last night; and it was a great experience.  I ordered 3by3 with grilled onions; fries; and a drink.  My mouth almost dropped when the dude told me the total: $7.80!  I'm gonna eat here more often.  The staff was nice; the girl callin out the orders didn't hump your leg; but was still attentive.  Fries weren't oversalted; burger was cooked well; and the Dr. Pepper tasted gooood.  5 stars.  Keep up the good work in-n-out.,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,"I stopped by this location at 11:30 on a Friday; before the lunch hour- or so I thought... This place was PACKED full of customers in line. The line was concert waiting long; really. As I was looking around to decide to stay or go; I noticed they were fully staffed; and the line was; well- moving. Upon closer inspection; it was moving very well. To help expedite the line; an employee came out from the counter and asked if anyone was ordering a hot sub; and he began taking those orders; and getting them started; which thinned the line quite a bit.  When I got to the counter; I was greeted warmly. I placed my order; picked my toppings and went to pay. Each employee was very nice; and the cashier and I were even joking back and forth; and it was really nice. It wasn't forced corporate speak; they were just nice and seemed excited about their product.  The sammie was very good; and while not as good as a Mom & Pop deli; it was good and the bread actually appeared as though it had seen an oven. The meat is sliced fresh (cannot understand why people eat at Subway; where it just sits; pre-sliced; for days). The veggies and condiments are fresh and plentiful.  Tips for success: -Carpool. This parking lot is very tight- no joke. -While  in line; check out the menu. It's silly to wait five minutes to order; and THEN look at the big menu and go 'Uhhh; uhhh; I think I want........ uhh.......\ -\""Mike's Way\"" is basically most of the toppings; there are signs that explain it -Call ahead or email your order; saves time  Enjoy!""",1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,After a long afternoon out shopping; my fiancé and I decided to stop into the recently opened Jersey Mike's for a quick bite. We'd both heard rave reviews about this place from his sister in-law who frequents it out in the East valley.  We were looking forward to finally trying it out for ourselves.  The restaurant is in a neat little corner plaza surrounded by other great eateries; all of which share a really great courtyard patio with lots of community-style seating.  We entered the establishment from the courtyard; which is technically the back of the shop; and walked in to see what was in store for us.  The place was clean and brightly lit; with music blaring from the speakers.  It was definitely too loud; as we had to fight to not only hear each other; but also the people at the counter.  After we were greeted; I had to ask the counter people to repeat everything at least twice.  Not good; especially when my fiancé overheard a girl on the prep line say to another customer that she couldn't hear what they said on account of the music.  After we decided on our sandwiches; we placed our orders and moved through the line.  I ordered a hot sub; the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak (or something to that effect) and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone.  We were handed a ticket which only had my order written on it and it took us a minute to figure out they only write the hot sub orders and have you go through the assembly line for cold subs.  It took a while to get through the line; there was one girl adding toppings to the cold subs; one guy standing by waiting to wrap the finished subs in paper; and another girl running the register.  In addition; one woman was running the hot sub station on her own; the manager-type was taking cold sub orders; and another guy was mopping the floor (Really? With customers in the store?).  Something happened at the register; and I had to stand there for ten minutes waiting for my receipt.  By that time; we had my fiancé's sub but were still waiting for mine.  The woman running the hot station started calling the name Roger. When no one responded to that name; she came out onto the floor and started asking everyone personally if they were Roger.  She just kind of stood there looking confused; so I thought to ask her what kind of sub she had prepared.  Turns out; it was my sub.  The name we had given; which was also on the ticket; was Bryan.  Yeah; not even close.  By that point; we'd been in there for close to 20 minutes and were very underwhelmed by the service we'd been given.  We took our food home to (hopefully) enjoy it.  The subs weren't bad.  They weren't great; either.  I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice; but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers; a bit too much cheese; and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it.  Bryan's turkey and provolone wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread on both of our sandwiches was average - soft all around and soggy with all of the condiments.  Neither came close to being as great as Jimmy John's; and for what I paid; I would go to Subway over Jersey Mike's.  I really hope this place makes some improvements to their customer service; and at the very least; they should turn down the music a few notches - that might help with the communication issues.,0

ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Love this place. Nice employees; fast service. I love the sense of urgency in a fast food restaurant. The sandwiches are filling and delicious. Their salads are also hefty; that makes me happy because sometimes salads are small because the company thinks you don't want to eat a lot because youre ordering a salad; not here.,1

ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,"Let me preface this review by stating that I have been to Jersey MIkes before and actually quite enjoy the food. My review is more or less in regards to the service. My coworker and I went here for lunch and this was the first time she had ever been to Jersey MIkes and it was my first time at this location.  When I placed my order I had forgotten that there was such thing as \Mikes way\"" and let me tell you that the lady creating the sandwiches let me know. I asked for a #6 with lettuce; tomatoes; oil and vinegar; salt and pepper and when I stated this the lady behind the counter rudely stated \""you mean mikes way\"" I said sure but I did not want onions and she said even louder this time \""so you mean mikes way without the onions.;\"" again I said sure. I then stated that I did not want oregano. There was an order right after mine which was a #6 as well except this time the oder came with onions and oregano.  At this point my sandwich was fine; but then when the woman began putting oregano on the sandwiches she went down the whole line (including mine) and put oregano on each one. I told her that was not what I ordered and rather than either starting over or taking off the lettuce which now had oregano all over it; she proceeded to swap my sandwich with the one behind mine; forgetting that that one had onions. I told the woman that I didnt want onions either and she looked up at me and gave me the rudest look from a restaurant employee I have ever seen. She the proceeded to take off the layer of lettuce and replace everything without oregano. The only thing that I can say for the service of this place were the two people checking people out who commented on my earrings (which made my day) and then guy cleaning the counter who was on his first day on the job; I can do with out the rude sandwich lady.""",0

ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,I have to order lunch for work meetings quite a bit; I'm always looking for good food that is a crowd pleaser. I tend to order online (easy!) and pick up the next day. The customer service has always been upbeat and they have been great about my requests (oil/vinegar on the side; that way the subs don't get soggy on the drive back to the office) - they even got me signed up for their loyalty card and I've earned a free sub.  Also; they are great about wrapping the veggie sub separate from the meat subs. This puts me at ease presenting the food to guests and coworkers. Also; the subs come labeled in a cute box. So be sure to consider the box of subs for your next office meeting or party of ten.,1

ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,The best Italian sub out there.   Blows Subway and Port o Subs out of the water.   All meats are high quality and cut to order.   Bread is big and fresh.   Get it Mike's way.  Perfect.  I've never had any problem with the staff at this location.   Always able to get a parking space too.,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Tried this place for the first time and got their version of an Italian. The ingredients quality was fine enough but I gotta say their Italian is nothing more than just a ham sandwich. If I wanted a ham sandwich I would have ordered just that. Where is the salami Mike?  If you want a real Italian Sub ladies and gents head up to 16th St & Bethany Home Rd. to Niccoli's and get it done right!,0
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,The subs were a little more money than Subway but worth the price.    This place is in a new urban development that looks great. However; this restaurant is a bit noisy and the staff had to yell to get my order (I personally don't like getting yelled at before I eat... I need soft; calm voices).  WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ORDER!!! I'll take a soft and calm sub please.   The food was great; the bread was my favorite because it was fresh and very soft (fluffy clouds from heaven); I'll be back.,0
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Funny how bad service can tip an already poor experience to the black list. There are hundreds of sub shops; I'm crossing this one off my list.,0
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Great service; prompt quick and really great food.,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,I ordered the Caesar Chicken wrap expecting a Caesar type salad in a wrap; what I got was diced chicken with iceberge lettuce and very little Caesar dressing; no parmasean cheese; no romaine or other greens or veggies; just iceberg lettuce. Very pricey for this simple wrap; close to 8 bucks. My daughter ordered a burger & fries from the burger place two doors down; it was a much better choice.  I've never tried their subs; so I can't rate the subs.,0
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Now these guys make a mean sub. Quality is top notch. Service is quick and place is well layer out. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the parking situation is the worst. The lot is for a bunch of businesses but is way to small. Trying to get in or out is like a scenario out of a mad max movie.,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,What can I say? I am really impressed by their business; last week we got two regular subs; when we got home we noticed that it seemed to be lacking in meat and the cheese was non-existent on one and paper thin on the other. The subs were still good; but it was disappointing and I sent my concern off to Jersey Mike's. Within a couple of hours the manager of the location I had this experience called me.  She offered to treat my family to a sub dinner for our trouble. That is obvious commitment to quality service. The subs were fantastic this time. Turns out they were actually having issues with the slicer the day I went.   They will get my business again; their subs are tasty; with quality ingredients; and they are committed to customer service. Yes their prices are a bit higher then a place like subway; but you do get what you pay for!,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Best Philly cheesesteak. Service greatly improved. They have gotten it together.,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,"Craving an east coast style sub; then this is your place!  Freshly baked bread and cold cuts sliced to order with your choice of toppings; or just try it \Mike's Way!\""  The only place I have found that has cherry pepper relish (a staple on east coast subs); which gives it the \""taste of home\"" for this former east coaster.  The place is located with several other restaurants and parking can be a challenge if you don't get there early.  Reward program available...""",0
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Huge fan of Jersey Mikes. This location opened a few months ago and is always booming! The bread is fresh; the meat and cheese it cut to order and the vegetables are crisp and perfect. The service has been great every time I've been. I always order my sammy Mike's way: lettuce; tomato; onion; oil; vinegar and seasoning. Just a killer sandwich shop....I'm a believer!,1

ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Disappointed.  I'm from Jersey; everybody in my family raves about Jersey Mikes and they are all in Jersey.  First off;  I ordered the Italian sub that comes with the works (5 different meats) and is supposed to come with provolone.  Got home to Buckeye to learn there was no provolone on my sandwich.  That throws the taste of an Italian sub off; period.  My second disappointment was the meat.  The franchise contracts out to a provisioner to make all their cold cuts under the Jersey Mike's label; but the meat does not have the flavor of New Jersey's finest deli meats; Thumann's. Boar's Head doesn't come in close to Thumann's but I'll take Boar's Head when nothing else is available. Third place goes to Dietz and Watson.  If Peter Cancro; the CEO of Mike's really cares; he'll get his meat elsewhere.   The staff was very friendly; the restaurant was clean; there were blown up photos of the Pt. Pleasant side of the Manasquan Inlet and Jenk's pier with surfers heading out; a nice touch of back home; but that's the best I can say.  The staff was so personable I don't regret leaving them a tip even though they forgot my cheese.  I just wish I had a good reason to go back and see them again.,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Stopped here along the way home. Woo; road trips! Great customer service and great subs! I'd recommend this place to others,1
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,Got terrible service and attitude from zombies behind the counter.  The food is good just don't expect any with a brain stem to help you out.  At least they they so stupid they under charged me.... at least that's a plus.,0
ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,For a chain sandwich shop this place is awesome. I have eaten there many times and have  never been disappointed. Service is quick and friendly too. I prefer the Italian sub and often doctor up a cheese steak with my won toppings but the Big Kahuna cheese steak is good too. The pepper relish they have for cold subs is really good and they don't skimp if you ask for more. Lastly; they have excellent; consistently fresh iced tea and a loyalty program that gives you freebies and good coupons. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the parking situation during the lunch and; to a lesser extent; the dinner rush is a nightmare.,1
kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,Yes; it's fast food but very good! I love the cheddar butter burger; fries and of course a concrete mixer! The only complaint about this location is they always mess something up with our order in the drive thru.,0
kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,Fried chicken had great flavor; but was too greasy. Green beans were a little too al dente. Overall very friendly people and quick service.,1
kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,My husband and I got burgers to go from Culver's recently; and while the food was tasty enough the service left a bit to be desired.    We ordered fries; but wasn'toffered or given any ketchup. I'll chalk that up to being our fault; we could and apparently should have asked. Also; no napkins with our to go order. Burgers and messes go hand in hand and Culver's is no exception to that rule...   My husband was still hungry after his burger; if you are debating between a single and a double patty burger; go big. You'll be sorry if you don't.   As a side note: I was born in Wisconsin and I was excited about going to Culver's because they have cheese curds. Except; the cheese curds are battered and deep fried so I didn't bother with them. Any Wisconsonite will tell you the best part of eating curds is listening to the squeek; and real cheese curds aren't deep fried.   Overall; not bad but there are definitely some areas for improvement. Next time I am passing through Casa Grande; I may give Culver's another try.,0

kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,This is the best Culver's I have ever eaten at. From the moment I walked in everyone was friendly and helpful. The facility was very clean. The food was delivered to my table in about 5 minutes and was exactly what I ordered. I will definitely eat here again with my family.,1
kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,It was my first time eating at a Culver's and I was pretty satisfied! I drove past on a Saturday afternoon around one to find the parking lot pretty busy. The inside; just the same... You know it's gotta be good if there's a lot of people! I was eyeing the tuna sandwich but for being known for burgers I got a bacon deluxe which was good but beware for those that have tmj... You'll have to open your mouth wide for it! The cashier asked if I wanted the fries or to substitute and gave me a list of options. He was very knowledgeable. I ended up ordered a vegetable beef soup which was pretty tasty. I wish it was a little bit more heartier but taste wise it was great. I also had the liberty of trying the culver root beer. I like root beer and comparing it to well known ones like Barq's or a&w; I think it was more like IBC root beer! I will definitely be back to try more menu items as well as the custard!,0
kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,Could not wait to try a butter burger. Ordered a cheddar butter burger. Was ok. Service was great.,1

kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,I've eaten at Culver's a few times now; this was my first time at this location. It was a good experience; overall. We had a large party and put together a few tables in the middle of the dining room and the staff was very accommodating to us. I was pleased with the service although it was nothing to write home about; it didn't exceed my expectations.   The food was also good; the burgers and fries were fresh and tasty.   We'd go there again.,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,This is my third time here; first time reviewing. We always go through the drive thru. I have never had an issue with my order or customer service. I'm usually not a fan of chicken tenders; these are the best and even with the drive home they are crisp and warn. I don't know what they put in the sauce but it's the best. I could go on and on about foods that are the best here; cole slaw; sweet tea and lemonade. This is one of the tastier fast food picks. This is a must try,1

2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,Very fair prices; great atmosphere; excellent guest service. Always a good time there; even drive through.Hot and fresh chicken. And they have crinkle fries!!!!,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,went through the drive thru; service was good. ckn was good and soft; very yummy esp. there cane sauce. the fries were mediocre and some were over cooked. not a coleslaw fan. but the toast was good. overall a decent meal for 9.07 that i split with my son. better places out there.,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,The parking lot was fairly clean abd maintained landscaping.  The bathroom and dining room we're clean and the decor was standard Cane's cheerful bright & welcoming.  I love that they still greet everyone upon entry.   Our order came out quickly.  The chicken was piping hot but the fries not so much.  I went to ask for their complimentary honey mustard because Cane sauce is good but really not that big of a deal IMO.  While at the counter I mention to the manager that my fries were not that hot.  She said ok but never offered me a replacement.  I was starving so I just walked away.   My opinion on the chicken.  It is very delicious; juicy and consistent in preparation.  I am not a huge fan of chicken fingers so the fact that we drove out of our way means there are worth the drive.  This location has faulty locking mechanisms on The bathroom stalls make for awkward moments.  I accidentally walked in on someone and the other stall would not lock at all.  Would I return; yes.  Hope my fries are hot.  lol,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,Good service ; yummy chicken . Love their Texas toast . Not very like  with their hot sauce though; it just not spicy enough for me.,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,"I'm sad to give just 2 stars on my first visit. I was hopeful for this new place. I went through the drive thru. What's up with the mic system? It was so hard to hear the employee.  And who puts the first window just a few feet from the place to order? No wonder lines here get long!   I ordered the Caniac to share with my son. I paid for the Caniac. I got home and saw they did not give me the Caniac. Packed my son back up in the car and drove back with now cold; untouched food. I chose to go inside to tell them about the order mix-up. I wasn't mad. They are new and it happens. Walking in we passed many employees out front on a break cussing and yelling. Inside employees were messing around.   I gave my food back and explained issue. The cashier took it and told cook they messed up on the order. Another random guy (maybe an employee who was off) yelled \Yea fix it!\"". The manager was called and she was confused because she didn't understand why she was needed. I never called her over.  She just said \""do we owe you money? \"" I got my food back. The container felt warm and I opened it to check it over.   All is well so back to the car to load in my kid. Cold food 10 minutes later at home. The cook just added some chicken to the box of food I returned.   Not impressed and will not return. The chicken and sauce lacked flavor. The staff was mediocre at best. Let's hope this place turns around quickly!  Chick-fil-a for life now!""",0
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,This place does one thing good and that is chicken strips!  I do not think they'll mind me saying this.  Prices are very reasonable.  The strips are amazing for fast food!  I've been to their other locations and this store on their second or third day.  Raising Cain's has some impressive quality standards in-place.  Every location I go to I am always served juicy chicken strips and the staff are trained well to assure that you will have excellent customer service.  I'm going on a limb here and am declaring these chicken strips the best fast food has to offer.,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,My boyfriend and I hit this place twice a week! Service is fast food is great along with the delicious canes sauce. . Love it!,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,Simple menu + tender chicken = Good  Dropped in with the work team to try out Raising Cane's in Avondale; at the 10 and 101.  It's basically a Five Guys but with chicken strips.  Menu is simple and straightforward.  The four meal options are a quick picker's heaven.  Staff was nice and snappy with the service.  And the amount of food you get for the money is an excellent deal.  My team loved their meals.  That said; for me it's chicken strips; bread; slaw; good wavy fries; and a soda.  Par.,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,"Went here for lunch today to see what could be so special about a place that just serves chicken fingers and we didn't get off to a good start.  I placed my order at 11:18 am (time on my receipt); and it was a mostly empty restaurant. The lunch rush had not started yet. I placed my order for a \Box Combo\"" and lemonade and stood by the counter thinking they would call my name. About 10 minutes into my wait I noticed they were bringing the orders to the tables so I went and sat down. I finished my lemonade while I waited and notice there was a charge for a refill so I got some tea instead. At 11:39 my order was brought to me.  The food was pretty good but how the heck does it take 21 minutes to cook chicken fingers and fries when that is all you do?  By the time I left it was very busy and I wondered if those people were waiting longer than I had to when the place wasn't busy? I'll give them another try and see if they are any faster next time.""",0
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,All I have been hearing is how great this place is; best chicken fingers in town. Well after hearing all of the hype; Wife and I decided to try this franchise out.  NO BIG DEAL!! Chicken was OK; not much flavor. Thinking they are counting on you trying their Cane Sauce for the flavor? Speaking of sauce; they have ketchup; honey mustard; and cane sauce. Now their Cane Sauce is like a thousand island with a little kick. They do not offer is mustard; and BBQ Sauce? Nothing here really stood out for me; it really wasn't that big of a deal. I would rather go to Chick-fil-a anytime! I do need to mentioned that their service was really good; the gals were very courteous; always making sure everything was fine! Overall; I am glad we at least tried it; not saying I wouldn't come here again. But there is better chicken out there.,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,This was my first visit to this location. The food was still tasty; but the customer service was lacking. The person taking orders seemed less than enthusiastic to be there. At one point; I saw a young girl drop her cup of ice on the ground and was passed by many workers. After a few minutes of cleaning her own mess; someone finally helped her. Lastly; at the other locations I've been to; managers generally come out to greet and visit. The person I assumed to be the manager never interacted with anyone; even the workers.,0

2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,Who can resist a southern style joint with that friendly feel; tasty chicken; and sweet tea?!  Raising Cane's is always hopping...think In 'n Out on it's busy afternoons.  Every time; you are warmly greeted by almost everyone who works there and they address you by name (after getting it from you at the counter).    Their famous sauce definitely makes it.  I've been a couple times now and only one time did I get dry chicken.  The other visits were made of juicy chicken strips!  You get a lot of food even if you only order their 3-piece; so be cautious of The Box with chicken; coleslaw; fries; and toast.    Try out their sweet tea or order yourself a lemonade (you have to ask when you order since the lemonade isn't out for you to get yourself).,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,Great service every time I come here!  Not a lot on the menu but that makes it easy to decide.  The chicken; special sauce; and Texas toast are amazing!  Not the greatest fries but everything else makes up for it.  Hoping one day they put one in North West Peoria!,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,"Wow ia that drive thru packed after 5 p.m.!  It was way faster for me to just get off of my car and order inside. I got my order extremely fast. I even got out sooner than some of the cars that were at the the drive thru.    It was my husnand and my first time trying out this restaurant. We wanted to try it after my brother raved of it being the best. I got the 6 piece chicken fingers; it comes with: fries; Cole slaw; a piece of toast;  and cane sauce.  I thought it was a little in the pricey side. I didn't really enjoy the chicken with their sauce. I ate mine with the Louisiana hot sauce they have at the restaurant. If my husband or I are ever in the mood for \chicken fingers\"" we'll just stick to KFC not worth the drive from Buckeye.""",1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,I LOVE Raising Cane's. The food is good and the sauce is even better. The employees are usually attentive and nice and always get my order right. That said; in this particular incident I went through the Drive-thru; I ordered a Caniac combo and asked for a half and half as a drink. She kept repeating my order back to me as a sweet tea; when I drove up to the window to pay; I corrected her and told her it was a half and half and she looked over at my drink and said that's what was made. I took a sip and told her politely that it wasn't a half and half; she then proceeded to argue with me that it was and that she had made it herself. She then offered to make me another one but that it would taste the same; so I let it go and drove off a little annoyed only to realize that she thought a half and half was half of a sweet tea and half of an unsweetened tea. A half and half; also known as an Arnold Palmer is mixture of half tea and half lemonade. Every time I have gone inside and asked for this type of drink; there has NEVER been an issue.,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,- Very limited menu but in a good way - food quality is not what you would expect at a fast food   restaurant; it was very good - the employees are nice but a little too excited for your average customer; they take customer service very serious!,1
2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,"I went to Cane's last night for the first time after a co-worker raved to me how good this place is.  I went through the drive thru so my review is solely based on the food and service in the drive thru.  I went to Cane's and bought dinner for myself and co-workers.  The service was adequate nothing special but nothing unpleasant.  The food came out quickly and I brought it back to work.  Big boxes and chicken sandwiches.  The presentation of the food was not that good.  Of course the styrofoam container is expected so that is not a factor in my rating.  The food was basically just tossed in the container.  I guess from a fast food place this would be the normal presentation.  There was such a big piece of lettuce on the sandwiches that it was literally sticking out the edges of the container; and it really wasn't a nice tasting piece of lettuce.  It wasn't crisp.  It was tough....yuck.  The bun was an egg type bun.  The same as a grocery store that you can get 8 for $3-$4.  The sandwich itself was $3.99. The \special\"" Cane sauce was nothing special at all.  The sandwich itself would have been better with mayo or BBQ on it; in my opinion.  The chicken strips here are awesome.  Real chicken; not processed and compressed chicken parts; seasoned and cooked perfect.  However; the 3 laid on this partially sauced; yucky lettuce bun was awkward to eat. I enjoyed mine by just eating the chicken fingers and leaving the rest of the \""sandwich\"".  Now the box.  The fries were nothing special.  Basic bought frozen; deep fried crinkle cut fries with more salt on them than needed.  They weren't gross but were just basic fries nothing special about them.  The cole slaw my co-workers liked was not good in my opinion.  I took one bite and that was the end of that.  The Texas toast was a soggy piece of sesame seed bread.  The chicken fingers were awesome though.  At least the signature item is on point here.  There should be an option for BBQ sauce or something aside from this signature Cane sauce.  I would return for the chicken fingers and maybe some fries with them.  The rest of what I had eaten here I would not eat again.""",0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,I'm really torn on the number of stars this rating should be.  We didn't go inside; so I can't really judge the place.  The drive-thru was full of pigeons having sex which made me tense and uncomfortable.  I didn't have to wait in the Aviary Burlesque House for too long before you took my order and let me get up to the window.  I thought the prices were high for cheap asian food but the quantity was there.    The egg rolls were probably the best I've ever eaten.  I hate egg rolls but I would order one of those again.  My orange chicken; however; was tough and rubbery.  The orange flavor was fine; but those pieces of meat had been sitting out a LOOOONG time.  Too bad too...  I may go back and try something else in the future...but for now; you suck.,0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Well; I was driving between work locations and in need of a quick lunch when I saw Yoshi's through the windshield.  I thought I remember hearing this was owned by the same guy who did Yasu Sushi (which is sublime) so I went in despite the large Pepsi banner outside.  I should have known just by that a lackluster experience was about to be had... I ordered the spicy dragon beef bowl and gyoza and an iced tea :)  The beef had an interesting flavor akin to melted plastic.  I kept waiting for the spicy to kick in but it never did.  The gyoza were cold; yet amazingly enough they were crunchy enough to chip teeth if you weren't careful. The tea wasn't bad...,0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,"saturday afternoon: after a busy morning of \Total.Hangover.Cure\"" induced shopping at the saturday market and then an eventful trip to Trader Joe's my buddy Polo and I were getting apprehensive with Hunger. I was eager to take him somewhere that would fit his requirements (cheap/plentiful) so that he wouldnt embarass me like he had at a \""colorful\"" brunch my brother and I had taken him to at FEZ; which ended in him loudly and unapologetically complaining about portion sizes and price. My best bud Polo is a big dude; and accordingly a rather big penny pincher. I was driving us back to my pad when we passed Yoshi's on central; \""whats that place?\"" he says; \""oh; just like this japanese fast food place; it's slightly better than kyoto bowl..\"" he nearly grabbed the steering wheel outta my hands. I veered into the drive thru; ordered a chicken yakisoba bowl for him; and a chicken curry for myself. As we waited for our orders a group of elderly folks strolled by; donna summer was playing on the radio; impulsively i blasted her sweet disco melodies as loud as my car speakers would allow; and we had an improtu dance party in my car as they stared in horror and confusion. the gal who worked at yoshi's opened the drive thru window; laughed and handed us our orders. We took my groceries and our Yoshi's bowls back to my pad; had a quick refresher; and dug into our Yoshi's bowls as we watched always sunny and spent the rest of the afternoon with full belly's of joy. Yoshi's is an easy; fast; and fairly decent alternative to panda or KytBwl; i'll be back soon most likely.""",1
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,It's fine.   I miss the Yoshi's of old; though. They used to make the sushi rolls as you ordered them. The Yoshi Roll was the best!! They still make them; but they are never available (and they are called Chicken rolls now). I asked why and they only make 2 orders worth in the morning and they go fast.  That to me says MAKE MORE ROLLS.,0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Yoshi's was not bad; but it wasn't really that good either.  It get's three stars though for the delicious egg rolls.  They were big and packed with pork and veggies.  Good stuff; but pretty greasy.  The rest of the menu was fairly so-so.  The options were pretty much chicken or beef covered in some kind of sauce.  I got the yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken.  It was actually pretty good once you mixed it around.  The noodles were mixed with veggies like carrots; zucchini; cabbage; and onions and drenched in a very tangy citrus soy sauce.  The chicken however; was just placed on top with no sauce or anything.  Kind of weird.  I enjoyed it until about half way through when the sauce became too much for me to handle.  I'll just drain in next time.  I will probably be back; but maybe just to order way too many eggrolls to gorge on.,0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,I am not really sure why people keep going back to Yoshi's!  I ate it once.  ONCE.  It was right across the street from work (the Indian School & Central location) and everyone went there everyday.  So; I figured I would try it.  Now; I ordered chicken; but I'm really not sure what meat it was OR what part of the chicken it was from.  It was really string-fatty-grizzly.  Teriaki sauce was good and the rice was ok; if a bit *too* sticky for my liking.,0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,"Repulsive. It's plain white rice with Teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken. I made the mistake of not ordering the bowl \white meat only\"" and ended up with a bowl of fat; gristle; skin; cartilage; and odd-tasting bits that I couldn't identify. This is a $6 bowl of disgusting crap. I'm told that the \""white meat only\"" option is important. I don't care. Nobody should serve that; ever.   If you want a decent teriyaki bowl that won't make you want to vomit; go to Costco and get their frozen bowls. I can't remember the brand; but it's got veggies; delicious white meat (with a lot of flavor); rice; and sauce. It comes out to about $1.30 per bowl.   I'm eager to finish this review so that I can stop thinking about that disgusting bowl. So that's all.""",0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Try their dragon chicken bowl! It's great! The service is good; you don't wait much; you get served less than 2 minutes..  Parking is easily accessible.. The staff are happy and the place is clean,1
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,The teriyaki bowl with white meat is good.  It's not knock your socks off but I go there weekly to get my rice bowl fix on.  The lunch service is pretty fast which is a big plus.,1
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Dear Yoshi's.  You and I go way way back.  Remember that one time I ordered Combo #2 (Teriyaki chicken)?  Oh yeah I mean that was about 500 times.  Remember that time the girl behind the counter was puzzling over my request for some Gomasho?  Oh I meant the 500 times (it's ok; eventually she figures out what I'm asking for).  Remember that time Kirk and I saw a cockroach hanging out near the bathrooms?  It really happened!  But only one time did I see it.  Don't get defensive now; Yoshi's; but please take care of that problem if you haven't already.  It's ok; we will still do business together---especially if you keep your prices moderate.  I'll still order Dragon chicken.  I'll still brave your parking lot; fending off the odd transient here and there.  It's nice to know you'll always be there for some decent japanese style food at a moderate price.,0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Service is a solid 2; food maybe a 3.5. Rounding up since the $2 happy hour Teriyaki Bowl is a pretty good deal and it's right up the street from my ivory tower.   Considering there aren't many options for me and my half hour lunches downtown; could be a lot worse.,0
L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Still trying to find my go-to noodle bowl place after visiting Yoshi's. This place looked dive-ish; but some of the best dishes come from places that look just like this. We went through the drive-thru around 8pm last Wednesday. The inside looked closed as the chairs were all stacked on the tables; but the drive-thru was buzzing.   My friend and I both got the Yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken. I also ordered an order of Gyoza. Both bowls and Gyoza came to $11.00 with tax. Pretty decent prices I thought.   We got back to my house; opened up the white wine; and camped out on the couch with our dinners. The sauce was pretty good- kind of a citrus soy. The noodles were good; even if average. Veggies and chicken were okay too. I guess the whole bowl was just okay. I was really craving the noodles and it shouldn't be hard to make good noodles at a Noodle place. The Gyoza were alright too- kind of crunchy around the edges. The sauce served with them were good though.   All in all; not my dream dinner; but just okay. Would probably drive-thru again if I was in the area and didn't feel like cooking that night.,0
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Fast friendly service; good chicken bowls and you get a lot for your $$$,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,I love Luu's! Think of it as an authentic yokohama rice bowl. The ingredients are really fresh; and the price is beyond reasonable. The service is always quick and friendly. Oh and they don't skimp on the portion size or sauce; like some other places. Go try it!!!,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Luu's is a must try if you have a teriyaki craving . I ordered a teriyaki bowl with chicken breast . Everything was so fresh considering how fast it was to make it . I will for sure stop by the next time I need a quick bite in that neighborhood .,0
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,My all time favorite Phoenix fast food restaurant. I have been coming here for almost 3 years and they have consistently good food; and excellent customer service. Christy; the gal at the drive through window; is the nicest; most friendly person I have encountered at a restaurant here in Phoenix.   I usually order the ginger chicken bowl with no rice and extra veggies. All the veggies are fresh; never frozen (you can see the whole carrots and fresh broccoli and cabbage from the window); and they are steamed to crunchy perfection. The ginger sauce is great; the portions are HUGE; and the prices are terrific. The crab puffs are full of crab (I find it strange at other restaurants crab puffs are on the menu; but don't actually have any crab in them); and are an excellent price at 6/$2.50. The spicy chicken wings and chicken satay are also delicious.  Luu's Chicken bowl has great food; great prices; and the best customer service in Phoenix!,1

iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Pork bowl; chicken bowl; crab puffs. Absolutely delicious!   Quality ingredients; super fresh and tasty side sauces. Honestly I have never had drive through Japanese this good. The owners are awesome and tonight they are staying open late to accommodate my order.  Fast; friendly and fresh. It doesn't get much better at this price and convenience.,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,"I've eaten here twice; and though others have raved about this place; I don't see it as anything outstanding.  The service is definitely great - they are family owned and super friendly.  The food is fresh and the crab puffs definitely are tasty.  The first time we came; I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl - it came with some veggies and rice.  Though it was hot and fresh; the taste wasn't amazing - but it was good. The 2nd time I ordered the BBQ pork - I thought it'd be more like \char siu\"" but it wasn't - it was just drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  The meat was plentiful of course.  I will keep coming here since our house is nearby when I have those bowl cravings.""",1

iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,For fast food; it doesn't get any better than this!  My favorite is the ginger chicken bowl with white meat and brown rice.  I've been coming here for months and can't get enough.  The sauces are homemade and amazing... the service is top notch... the restaurant is clean... and everything is cooked fresh to order.  If you're looking for great food on an ordinary day; Luu's Chicken Bowl is your best bet.,1

iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Great authentic Japanese fast food at great prices. Fast friendly service. I got the chicken teriyaki and yakisoba. It was very tasty at a great price and they give a good portion. I would definitely recommend going here if you want authentic cheap Japanese food.,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,I came here after finding it on yelp. Their food is very fresh; with the chicken carefully laid across the vegetables and rice with sauce on top. The presentation is really lovely for a fast food-ish place. In addition; the staff was super friendly. I told them it was my first time dining there; and they advised me to order the ginger chicken bowl; which I loved. I also ordered the crab puffs; after seeing so many positive reviews. The crab puffs were not all cream cheese like at other places; they were filled with crab and had some green onions; too. Be careful if you order these- they make them fresh for each order and they are HOT when they first come out! I dipped them in both the sweet and sour and the hot sauce that can be found at the sauce bar.  I wish I had gotten brown rice; but now I know for next time. I recommend this place if you are looking for a quick; cheap; asian fix in the area.,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,"I just moved to Portland and you'd think I would be able to find something comparable to Luu's; but no such luck. I miss it already! The owners are sooooo nice; I would eat here at least twice a month for the three years I lived off Cactus. I think the only thing they don't make in-house is their wonton wrappers. Seriously: house-made sweet and sour? I've eaten so much Japanese/Chinese food and never once been to a place that makes virtually everything from scratch. I once went there and the wife asked if I wanted some sweet and sour with my eggroll. Even though it's delicious (ie not corn syrup with red food coloring); I told her I preferred Chinese hot mustard. I think about 3 months went by; I ordered my go-to of a teriyaki chicken bowl with an egg roll; and she says \Oh! I remembered you liked the hot mustard so I made some for you!\"" The mustard wasn't that great; I think she put soy sauce in it; but the gesture alone was awesome.  Highlights: * chicken is always seasoned and cooked to perfection with yummy caramelization from the flattop * crab puffs used to have real crab in them; last time I went it was imitation; but still some of the best I've had. They actually season the filling so it doesn't just taste like a ball of cream cheese. * perfectly steamed veggies! They definitely could use some salt; but they were never mushy or old tasting...always fresh and delicious! * yakisoba is some of the best I've had: not drowning in sauce; lovingly sprinkled with green onions and sesame seeds. * their tofu nuggets were probably the biggest surprise of all; they must make them in house. I would order those regularly and I'm not a vegetarian.  * they will customize your order without batting an eyelash: tofu nuggets instead of chicken? All veggies instead of rice in the teriyaki bowl? White meat only? Brown rice? You got it!  Portland is supposed to be this foodie Mecca; I went to a \""House of Teriyaki\"" that had 4 1/2 star reviews and it was disgusting. In fact; it was their $8; no-better-than-a-frozen entrée chicken yakisoba that inspired me to write this review because I realized how much I miss Luu's already. For $8 at Luu's I could've had some of the most delicious chicken yakisoba ever and two eggrolls (FRESHLY fried and using quality filling). So; do yourself a favor and stop by here if you're in the area while I continue my search for a place near me up here that is fast; friendly; CHEAP; and has standards beyond a school cafeteria.""",1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Service; service; service!!! They always win us over with their smiles and positive attitude!!! The lady at the register and drive through is super nice and consistently friendly!! Plus; I am a super fan of the Special Chicken Roll and traditional teriyaky!!! :),1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,BEST Japanese food in the valley!! hands down you will not be disappointed they have the best tasting sesame chicken & original sauce I've ever had.  This is a quaint place with friendly service; eat in or drive thru.  The staff is friendly; the atmosphere is comfortable and clean and to top it off the prices are the most reasonable in town too!!  Must try dishes; tempura shrimp; teriyaki chicken and sesame chicken.  This place ROCKS!!!,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Love the ginger salad dressing. Food is always nice and hot. Service is very friendly. I love that they have a drive thru for those post yard work dinners (you know; when you're all dirty and sweaty and don't want to offend anyone). Definitely a great alternative to the typical burger fast food drive thru. Good prices; too!,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,What a great discovery!  Luu's Chicken Bowl is a current favorite for our family.  We had driven by the location several times without even noticing it was there; but I could not be more happy we stumbled across it.   For those of you who don't like to read a page long review; here are some of the things I love most about Luu's....  Homemade; amazingly delicious sauces Fresh; high quality ingredients Fast; friendly service Great prices and generous servings They have a drive through  These guys know how to pack a to-go sack! ...and last but not least.......the CRAB WONTONS!  Oh; you want to know more?  Well; let me elaborate a bit :)  Upon entering Luu's; I always know I will be greeted by a smiling friendly face and an immaculately clean dining area.  There is a white board near the register listing the daily specials (try the teriyaki chicken and yakisoba) and a small counter housing homemade condiments; plastic utensils and a soda fountain.  After I place my order; I always hear a fresh batch of wontons get dropped in the fryer as they prepare our chicken bowls.  After just a few minutes; my order is on the counter perfectly parceled with everything I could need; extra teriyaki sauce; hot sauce; sweet and sour; and if we get a ginger chicken bowl (another must try item) there is also extra ginger sauce.  There are napkins and utensils included in the bag; as well.  If you decide to go through the drive through; keep in mind that they fry the wontons and egg rolls to order so there will be a few minutes of waiting at the window if you order these items.  The crab wontons are the crabbiest I have had.  Ever. They are delish with a double dip into the sweet and sour and then the hot sauce.  Trust me; it will be the best $2.59 +tax you have spent in a long time   **For a nominal fee you can substitute white meat chicken and/or brown rice; both of which I highly recommend,1

iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Finally a decent place opens in the otherwise cursed location.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The cuisine is Japanese with an emphasis on rice bowls with an average meal at about $8.00.  The chicken bowls are delicious; especially with all white meat.  The style is fast food; but the preparation and delivery are first rate and orders are made to order.  The teriyaki is prepared by the facility; not that sweat molasses crap you find elsewhere at comparable chain restaurants.  Family owned and operated.  A great dining experience.,1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Great food! The price is right for a chicken bowl; just under $5 and for just under $6; you can get a combo with pork; chicken or beef. I recently ordered food for 6 people and it could have fed 8-10. Oh; and the crab puffs?? Really; really good and only $2.50 for a bag of 6. I would recommend this for take-out. The inside of the restaurant is kind of what you'd expect (tacky and hole-in-the-wallish).,0
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,"A friend of ours recommended Luu's to us a few months back.  We were sold after our first visit and been back several satisfying times.  I usually get the pork bowl.  The meat is very tender and the vegetables are ALWAYS fresh and perfectly cooked.  The various sauces are a perfect compliment.  They have a super tasty hot sauce that Jeannie and I really like.  Jeannie usually gets the chicken bowl ( my kids have had them too and they devoured it!) or a salad ( the salad is just a salad; but it like everything is prepared well and always fresh) and she has never been disappointed with her meals. Like Mark G. said; the preparation and delivery are always solid and they show a true interest in customer satisfaction.  I always order a egg roll. Ordering an egg roll at most Asian \fast food\"" places is always a let down for me. They always seem to be on the extremely greasy side or heat lamp dehydrated;  and usually packed with ancient overcooked  fixings. However; the ones at Luu's are always super flaky; and filled with fresh and tasty fillings.    We were talked into some crab puffs on our last visit.  Not sure I would give up my egg roll for them; but they were very good.  I think the order came with six little golden purses of sweet crab filling.  We had to fight over them because everyone in this family of four wanted seconds!  I figured I had enough fried food in the form of my treasured egg roll and I wasn't about to share that bad boy.  Have to expand our menu selections.  But the bowls are hard to beat since they come in at around $5.""",1
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Went in the drive thru at Luu's tonight for the first time.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki with yakisoba and a chicken spring roll.  The spring roll was FAT; and good.  The dipping sauce was just one-note sweet; which was fine.  The yakisoba was insane.  Great texture and flavor; enjoyed the veggies in it.  The chicken teriyaki was kind of a different story.  Despite it being dark meat; it was pretty dry.  The teriyaki sauce was savory; with no sweetness to it at all.  I was kind of surprised since it seems so many people order it from the reviews.  I will try the pork next time; as that seems to be another favorite; or maybe the sesame chicken.  But I am not giving up on Luu's!,0
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,A nice inexpensive neighborhood place for a rice bowl.  We tried the ginger chicken and teriyaki chicken bowls - both were quite good and the sauce was provided generously.  We also ordered the crab puffs which were also tastey. Don't be turned away by the appearance of the building; we were happy we gave it a try.,0
iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Not what you'd think from a hole-in-the-wall place. Great food; awesome customer service; amazing prices. Luu's stands out in a fast food environment with loads of competition who seemingly care only about your money. I've had several dishes here and they're always fast; fresh and delicious. I've been reluctant to give any restaurant 5 stars before; but Luu's is worthy of the rating. Great eats. Recommend the yakisoba with teriyaki chicken; or the teriyaki chicken bowl (served with sweet jasmine rice!),1
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,I went to Yelp to find a good Chinese food delivery place and came upon this one.  The last one I used to go to must have changed owners or something because the food went from amazing to awful.  I'm so glad we found this one.  The prices are reasonable and the food was delicious.  I ordered the spicy thai chicken and it was awesome. It had lots of chicken and good quality chicken at that.  My boyfriend ordered the hunan spicy beef and again the beef was perfectly cooked.  We also ordered the pot stickers; and crab puffs and they didn't disappoint either.  The fried rice was not the best I ever had but it won't stop me from ordering there again.  This will be my go to place for Chinese from now on!  I don't know why anyone would give this place less than four stars.,0
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,This place is probably one of my favorite lunch spots in there area besides getting some Chino action in my life. Food is all that you'd expect from an Americanized Asian joint. The price is the gem. The lunch specials are stellar. If you pay more than $7 you're ordering wrong.   The portions are plenty generous for the price. The place is clean; friendly; and fast. All things that I value very much during my limited lunch hour. I go 1-2 times a week; and have yet to be disappointed. Give it a go,1
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,The service here is great. Food arrived quickly. Be warned they dont include utensils. But what was delivered was fantastic! I would describe the food here as healthy; flavorful asian fusion..... and that's lowballing it.   we ordered orange chicken; thai spicy chicken; broccoli beef & soup. everything was fantastic.Thai chicken is deliciously SPICY. The wonton soup should be called surprise soup bcuz there's a yummy surprise in the bottom. Try it! Best egg rolls. Try them too. Happy 2013!,1

uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,"Merriam-Webster defines \Café\"" as follows... \""A usually small and informal establishment serving various refreshments (as coffee).\""  Can you get coffee here?  No.  Well; to be honest; I have never asked for coffee; but who would at a Chinese... I mean...Asian restaurant.  So this so called \""Café\"" has no coffee.  Is that a problem?  No.  First of all; they do have 2/3 of the definition correct.  It is small; and informal.  For me; that is close enough.  I do have to say; though; that for an order-at-the-counter \""Asian\"" restaurant; it is extremely clean and new inside.  And the staff is extremely friendly.  In fact; you can ask them about their food and they actually have an answer!  Now friends; this is extremely peculiar for such a restaurant.  This friendliness also lends itself to some flexibility when it comes to ordering.  They will let you substitute meats; adjust heat of a dish; etc.; without blinking and eye.  And all this for dirt farm poor prices.  The lunch specials are an insane bargain with all kinds of sides.  And for dinner; although it is a bit more expensive; they load you up with tons of food.     But this begs the question you are all wondering.  Is this \""Café\"" at least \""Asian?\""  Merriam-Webster defines \""Asian\"" as follows...\""Of; relating to; or characteristic of the continent of Asia or its people.\""  So do they have Russian food here?  No.  Do they have Vegemite here?  No.  Do they even have Korean food or Japanese food?  No.  This is truly Chinese food; without question.  And it is an outstanding example of Chinese cuisine.  Everything is made to order; extremely fresh; and very light and authentic; sort of the anti-Panda Express.  And considering this place will make your food just about as quickly; without having to wait in line with a bunch of mouth-breathing yahoos; I would highly recommend a visit to Asian Café; even if the name is completely and utterly misleading.  And besides; the name still makes a lot more sense than Panda Express.  I mean; can you eat Panda there?  Do they have Pandas working in the kitchen?  Do they have a Panda petting zoo in there somewhere?  Would you want that where you eat anyway?  I hear those things are dirty; ornery; and smelly.""",1
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,I recently moved to this neighborhood. I stumbled upon this place one day when I was headed to the pizza place next door; but I didn't really want pizza. WOW; what a great find. The food is fresh and prepared quickly; and the portions are huge. The staff are very nice. I usually get the small; which is enough for two meals. Now; I call to place an order for pickup; and they tell me 15 minutes; but it is usually closer to 5. Delivery has been very quick as well. I have tried almost everything on the menu; and love it all.,1
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,The food and service was outstanding. The soup and lo mien delicious.  Thai spicy shrimp as well.,1
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,I've been here several times and although the food is mostly pretty good; the man behind the counter is ALWAYS rude. No matter how polite we are to him; he never fails to roll his eyes at us when we ask for extra sweet and sour or hot mustard. He also rolls his eyes when we ask simple questions about the dishes we plan to order. He talks to us like we are stupid and always makes it clear that we are inconveniencing him. If they didn't have lunch specials at such a great price I probably wouldn't go back due to his bad attitude; but the food and prices are pretty good. My favorites are the beef and broccoli and the Thai spicy chicken. The egg roll would be one of the best I've had except they don't change their fryer oil often enough and anything deep fried has a nasty rancid oil flavor.,0
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,We flew into Phoenix and decided to eat lunch before we headed to Sedona. We were craving Asian food and decided to give Asian Cafe a try. We ordered; Mongolian beef; spicy Thai chicken; sesame chicken; and sweet and sour chicken. Each entree was accompanied by a scoop of fried rice; a scoop of noodles; an egg roll; a fortune cookie; and a soda. The egg roll was pretty standard fare; but had a nice ginger taste that was unique. The fried rice was quite bland. I am not an Asian noodle fan; so I did not try them. The chicken entrees were all good. All in all; the food was fine. It was very inexpensive ... $4.50 for the whole meal. I was not impressed; however;  with the styrofoam food boxes (dine-in meals  served that way); styrofoam cups and plastic forks and knives. I do not think I would return to or recommend the restaurant as there are many others to choose from in the area .,0
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,My first time at the Asian Cafe; after reading the reviews here I gave it a shot.  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken; with 2 egg rolls.   The chicken was very over cooked; and mostly inedible; the egg rolls were good but had a lot of black pepper in them.  Overall the highlight was the egg rolls; but the chicken upset my stomach; and I can't see myself returning to this location.,0
uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,Our food was horrible! We ordered the Mongolian beef; it was all onions hardly any meat. Not to mention the Gen. Tao chicken was horrible too! Not even sure if it was chicken. This little café is down the street from my house; I used to go there all the time. I had not been here in a while before tonight. I will never return again. We got the food to go. I should've taken it back. But after working all day; I was just too tired. Beware!!! Go anywhere else but here. You will be disappointed.,0
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,My daughter's school recently had a fundraiser here.  For the amount of people they had and the line nearly out the door; they did a great job of keeping it moving!    I love Chipotle.  The burrito bowl is filling and delicious!  It's a great idea.  I always find I feel over stuffed with a regular burrito but the bowl is perfect.  Their chips are fresh and their guacamole is delicious!  It has just the right amount of zip for me.  The kids meal is a good deal.  My daughter gets her favorite cheese quesadilla and rice and beans along with a drink.    This location is clean and friendly.  No matter if the line is long or short; they do a great job with good service and good food.,1
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,I love this place.  Not simply Chipotle; but this one. The service is so good and it makes me feel so good to eat in there. They actually seem to care about you here.  Something not always consistent with every location of this brand.  I always get the same thing when I go and never get bored of it.  They seem to recognize me when I go there which is often on a Saturday afternoon if I am in that area.  Such friendly people.,1
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,The service at this restaurant is terrible.  They throw food at you like they are giving food to the homeless. :(   I called the manager to complain; and she said she will fix the problem.   The food are so expensive here.  The burrito is full of rice and very little of everything else.   Do you ever question what you put in your stomach for your meal??? They claim that they try to get organic food here; but I don't really know or we all don't know how hard they try (1% or 99% organic????).    It is better to go to a less expensive fast food place.,0
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,Always a winner!!  The bowls; tacos; burritos and quesadillas are always delicious and the service is always fast; even with a line out the door.  LOVE this place.,1
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,"I have to downgrade my review for THIS location; which my husband and frequent at least 2X a week.  Have to admit we LOVE us some Chipotle BUT....EVERY time we go into get lunch or dinner they are out of something (chicken; rice; forks/knives; soda; Iced tea).  Tonight we went for dinner.  Hubby ordered a large soda and was SO looking forward to a Coke Zero (he usually doesn't drink it..just water...so this was a special order!)...to find out that it's out.  So we tell the cashier who yells in the back for someone to switch out the line.  We wait.  We check for Coke Zero...still looking like Sprite out of the soda dispenser.  We wait some more.  Go back and check and it's still running clear as Sprite.  So I ask the worker about it and she says; \Oh..we are out of Coke Zero.  Like completely out!\""  Ummm...well the only reason we bought a large drink was to get a Coke Zero.  And it would have been nice to know that info the FIRST time we asked you about it being out!!  And perhaps you should put a sign up for future customers?  We slide on over to grab some forks for our meals.  There are no forks.  The place has no customers except maybe 6 other people who are eating their food; nobody in line and all the while there are literally 7  workers standing on the line and they're not fully stocked?  How does that happen?  My guess is poor management.  Andale; Chipotle!  Get your act together.  I see that I'm not the only reviewer writing about this; either.""",0
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,Currently I am on a diet called the Paleo diet or in simple terms the caveman diet. While trying to order my strange burrito bowl without beans and rice the person who made my burrito bowl was pretty disrespectful.  Asking for half chicken and half pork he placed just a smidgeon of both meats into the empty bowl and just said okay is that all you want? After having another employee chime in by saying that's clearly not enough; i had to ask for more meat without stressing the option of paying extra.  Overall I'm pretty sure the employee is only used to the average status quo of a burrito. I enjoy Chipotle but probably wont come back to this one.,0
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,I ordered three hard tacos with barbacoa and the guy behind the counter put so little meat in each taco i thought he was playing a joke on me..... he then proceeded to tell me they put 4 oz. in three tacos.. combined. I think he was short by 2 oz. it was pathetic. id hate to see what the kiddos get.. they're tacos probably don't come with meat. Sadly; i would never go back. not worth the $.,0
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,"I don't frequent Chipotle because they pretty much have the same thing all the time.. not that that's a bad thing; just that I can get bored quickly.  When I do go; I do like to get their 2 soft corn tacos with beef or pork; which is marinated perfectly.  They are a bit stingy with the meat servings; but I guess I understand that if they are using \hormone free\"" (as they claim; but you never really are sure) meat.  I usually make it up with added fajitas; lettuce; salsa; etc.. then my tacos get really fat and filling.  The staff is nice and quick and gets my order done correctly.  This location can get really busy and have a long line at lunch (figures; a lot of people love Chipotle); but if you do the phone or online order; you can run in and pay and be out in a jiff.""",0
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,So normally I'm a huge fan of Chipotle so it's with a heavy heart that I write this review.  This review is more about the service though than the food.  I typically go to this Chipotle after my workouts because I feel it is a very healthy alternative when I am to tired to cook.  Tonight though; I usually order a veggie bowl which normally gets guacamole on top; they ran out on the person right in front of me.  Instead of discounting the veggie bowl or offering me free chips; which I asked about; they told me no basically and have me some excuse about a point system.  I can't imagine those chips are anywhere in the same price range as the guacamole and they probably go stale if they don't sell them out that day; so why not make a customers day a little happier when you can.   This will probably; in  no way; affect me going back but as a new vegetarian I look forward to the guacamole on my veggie bowl.,0

obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,All I have to say is AWESOME food and service ! I can say that I have aways had great food every time I come here ( which has been somewhat often ) over the years ... for a casual to go or even just to sit at a table and hang out meal..  Never disappointed.,1
obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,I love this Chipotle!!  They always take care of me despite my super picky order... I'm sure they hate it but they definitely don't let it show!!!  Everything's always fresh & even if they're busy; they still don't rush you.  Love them!,1
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,"We love Firehouse Subs! This particular location is new and hopefully the staff will become friendlier after the newness wheres off!  Food was awesome and made correctly. I love the steak and cheese; but hold the mustard ;) Each of our sandwiches were correct; we ordered four different ones.  There was no \Welcome to Firehouse\"" when entering the door; this was disappointing; since it always made you feel welcomed when you entered.Maybe a Sunday night isn't the best night to come in; but it was around 6:00 so they shouldn't of been wanting to close it up.  The place was very clean; but I do not like people sweeping when I am trying to eat my dinner. I know call me CRAZY but I really do believe that NO ESTABLISHMENT should sweep when people are at a table eating. Dust goes everywhere even if you can't see it.  There was only 1 other family in there; very quiet. I found that odd compared to other Firehouse Subs; but being that they are new; I hope that will change.   Love the soda machine with all the options available!  My other problem is the cost. It's now over $8.00 for a combo; which I believe is very high. I can eat at a sit down restaurant and pay less than $35.00 and still have a quick but nice meal.""",1
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Loved this place from the very first brisket & cheddar sub and kept coming back...bacon turkey ranch is great.  Veggie is great...never had a bad experience.  Told people at work about the food here and now everyone orders their lunch here.,1
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Great subs and a soda machine with every flavor. I wish the staff was more friendly. I've been here twice now and no one greets me or even says hi. Two people were just standing around while we waited for someone to take our order. We were the only ones in line. Love fire house and always round up. Pick it up east mesa!,0
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Two trips to Fireshouse and probably no more. First one waited 30 minutes for our sandwhiches. I ordered the meatball and it was similar to Subway. My girfriends sandwhich was soggy.  The second time the service was much faster and very friendly staff. The brisket sandwhich was so dry it was almost unedible. We took it home and put bbq sauce on it to make it better. It is new and maybe it will get better but we will probably pass.,0

tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Do not visit this location.  Complete food violations.  A customer drive back to return a to go order stating there was an extra sandwich in the bag; the employee removed the sandwich and served it to another costumer.    Shut this place down.  I threw out my food and left,0
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Very Impressed! I was helping my daugher move and this is right by her new place so we ran in for a sandwhich. We got the italian sub with chips and a drink. The italian sub was fantastic. So flavorful and just the right amount of stuff on it; including a very flavorful italian sauce. The sandwhich was perfectly toasted and good sized. The drink fountain was fun! It actually was fun! You can pick the type of soda/tea; etc and add flavoring. I had a raspberry lemonade and then when I was leaving I filled it up with cherry coke. Ok; I felt like a little kid playing with the machine! The service was fast and friendly. The food excellent and the location perfect for my daughter's new place. I will be back for an awesome sub!,1
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Do not visit this location. I ordered a sandwich to go; and when I arrive home and take the sandwich out of the bag it looks floppy and wet. I open the wrapper and the whole sandwich is completely soggy and falling apart and the tomatoes were squishy and old. I could not even eat half of it because it was just like mush bread and slimy meat. Never going there again.,0
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Love this place! Everything is so clean and the people are so nice. All the menu items look delicious; but I always order the number 8. I love that they donate to the local fire departments.,1
tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Went to this firehouse subs for the first time been to the other locations the customer service here is bad placed my order and when it was ready they called out the wrong name and I didn't know it was my order the lady said my order was ready I said Dan is not my name all they did was laugh not going there again,0

yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Been here many times and just couldn't get enough! The lines are very reasonable and the service is fairly quick. Food is the usual yummy and reliable burger we all came to love from in n out. It's tricky to get here because you must enter from  N 83rd ave. it's not connected to the mall and you can't enter from Bell.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Love their fries! I always get a double order of fries! This location is a bit annoying on the access and parking lot but it's bell rd. everything is hard to get in and out of. Especially when it's as popular as in & out!,0
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,After phenomenal In-N-Out experiences in Cali and subpar ones in Texas; I was initially nervous about the In-N-Out in AZ; more specifically Peoria. It is a slight notch below Cali; but certainly miles ahead of Dallas. Plus; I've learned that no matter what; animal style makes everything better. Yes; everything.  A double-double with french fries drenched in the animal style goo is always my go to and if I'm feeling extra saucy; I'll throw in a shake on top of it. I got all of the above here and while the burger was up to par; the fries and the shake were definitely under par. Dry potatoes and a hard shake made for tough consumption; but 1st world problems for spending less than $6 for a fattening meal would lead me to complain less and not more.  Service was pretty standard. Efficient; almost military precision in assembling my tray of heart attack worthy fast food. Impressive; considering how often they must deal with lines and rude tourists who know nothing about In-N-Out. What I still wouldn't give to have one of these in NYC ...,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,In-N-Out has never let me down; whether I've had it in LA or  AZ. I'm especially fond of this location because it's never that busy when I go and the service is; as always; fast and friendly. I usually get a double double; animal fries and a Neapolitan shake. I've yet to attempt a crazy secret menu order; but I have a feeling they would be more than happy to fullfil it here.,1

yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,"Is \California Cool\"" a brand? I think so; and I think In-N-Out personifies it better than any store in the mall selling overpriced clothing in Euro sizes.  Fresh ingredients including never frozen beef; and fries that are made after you order them. Pretty cheap pricing. Friendly service. Spotlessly clean. A secret menu adding intrigue to the ordinary.  So; what happens if you ask for your burger Gangnam Style?""",1

yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,My first In-N-Out experience! I've been waiting a long time for this - and I'm glad I finally made it!  Had the #2 (cheeseburger and fries) and it was great! Not my favorite burger - that will remain Backdoor Burger - but In-N-Out is very good. As everyone says; if you are in an area where you can partake; do. If I go back ill def try the animal style.   The drive through line was LONG! We went inside and the wait was very short - seems like the best option is to go inside and order to go.,0
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,I love In N Out but this location is awful ! My food was cold once I received it ; I waited at the window for over 20 minutes and all I ordered was a burger . Seriously slacking,0
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Out of around 15 In-N-Out's I've been; this one has the best food and service.  In-N-Out consistently provides top service; prices; and food quality in the burger and fries fast food chain market.  In-N-Out seriously needs to review their parking/drive through development.  Half the locations I've been to have some kind of issue.  This In-N-Out is RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ENTER/EXIT.  Once you're in the parking lot/drive though area it's ok.  If you're leaving In-N-Out; and planning to head west on Bell (or to the 101); it's almost impossible without a u-turn or separate lot turnaround in high volume traffic.    Despite the driving issues; THIS In-N-Out is SO GOOD I'VE BECOME A REGULAR (2-3 times a month).  I was not an In-N-Out regular before I visited this location.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Having recently moved back to Arizona; I had to get some In and Out. It was exactly as I remember. Always delicious food and I have never had any problems with the service. Everyone is friendly even when the place is packed.  I definitely suggest finding some hidden menu items to try. Animal fries are definitely worth trying.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,"The food is definitely fresh. But their single burger is \so\"" paper thin. It's a joke. It's for a small child. It's almost like they what you; to buy a \""Double Double\"" for more money. Strike Number One.  Then; to get into their place and out of their place.....is a Mess.  And; I'm sorry but they take along.....time to get your food ready; in the \""drive-thru\"". At least 10 minute's. Too long.  And they \""repeat\"" your order over and over....and over. With their \""happy\"" smiles.   Sorry gang; I don't think....it's that great.  They need to \""improve\"" alot of things.""",0
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,On an extended visit to AZ; I am lucky enough to be staying only a couple miles from this particular In-N-Out location. Yes; the parking lot is difficult to get into. Yes; there is often a wait. Even so; it's been my Friday night indulgence for the past month now. Even with a line of cars stretching far into the parking lot; the wait is never more than 10 minutes.  Why is In-N-Out Burger so good? I'd wager there's a secret narcotic they put in the sauce. I love that they have someone in the parking lot to take orders and transmit them wirelessly to minimize wait time. I love how pleasant all their staff is. I love how clean the place is. Have I mentioned how much I love this place?  I'll take their simple menu of a few things they do really well over an extensive menu of mediocrity any day. I've been known to plan road trips and stops around In-N-Out; so maybe I'm biased. I just wish there was a location (or several) in Seattle. One can dream; right?,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Great location. Can't really go wrong with in n out. Customer service is always top notch.  Place can be crowded and loud but always clean and you will get taken care of. Open late so great for after all day events to treat yourself.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,I first ate at In & Out when I was in Las Vegas several years ago. Then a few years ago they moved to Arizona and at a location not far from where I live in Peoria. The attraction for me was the ability to get a burger wrapped in lettuce. (Protein Style) If you know the key words you can get your burger cooked many ways that are not published on the menu. I could never quite understand the crowd of people coming there to eat. Lined up out the door and a line of cars around the place with someone out side taking orders. It is just a hamburger nothing exceptional. They do have good fries. Better than most.  Today I had spent 3 hours installing cabinet doors at my in-laws house. Was not supposed to take this much time but it seems to go that way at times. Well I worked way past lunch and was hungry. In & Out was on the way home. Really should of driven a couple of miles out of the way and gone to Rocket Burger.  Any way I got what I always get a single cheese burger protein style a order of fries and a ice tea. Now I don't eat there very often but when I took my first bite and looked at the burger I noticed it was only about 3/16 of an inch thick. It could of even been thinner. I went WOW where is the beef.(Sorry for using an over used term.) This was quite a bit thinner than I can rememberer. I know; I know; I know; if they had been that thin in the past I surely would of noticed. It was just a little thicker than peanut butter spread on a piece of toast. Guess I can blame it on the economy. Rocket Burger is at least 2 to 3 times thicker. Much better value.  If you go to In & Out; look at the patty.   This review is meant to inform. Not to be negative. Hopefully you do not take it as being negative.  In & Out is always clean; the people friendly and cheerful; the food was good tasting.  The reason for the 2 stars and not 3 was value. The people at the restaurant did everything right.  Happy eating!,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,You can always expect to see young but extremely hardworking people working at In-n-out.  I only ordered fries; but there are no other fries that compare to this old classic.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Animal style - grilled onions and sauce; yummy! Fries are always the best. This burger joint does it best; hands down; at almost every location. This one didn't disappoint and of course I ate there more than once on my short stay nearby.  Their short menu - just burgers; fries; drinks (shakes!); quick service even when 20 are before you; and tasty wholesome ingredients make this the best eatin in town; in their limited west coast locations.  If you are bored or need some inspiration; check out the psalms on paper goods.  This isn't just some heartless fast food chain!,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,"Things I Like That I Know I Shouldn't:  Pickle juice straight from the jar. \Rock Star\"" by Nickelback. A 4x4 with animal style fries from In-N-Out.  The \""secret menu\"" is the best practical joke since Mariah Carey's movie career. It's not secret (In-N-Out has the damn thing posted on its website) and it's not much of a menu as it is just more combinations of food and condiments (except maybe the Grilled Cheese).   Yet for all my mockery; I myself am obsessed with this fast food phenomenon. Out of going to In-N-Out for two years; I haven't ordered anything off the \""regular menu\"" in 23 months. And even then; I make one of my awestruck lackeys do it for me. It's become campus lore that if you owe Jetta a favor; expect visit In-N-Out holding a sheet of pink paper with the most nonsensical order in the history of lunch runs written on it in pink lettering.  Jetta helped you get a 90 on that test? Flying Dutchman with well done fries. Jetta came in on her day off to cover your shift in the computer lab? Grilled Cheese; light fries; and a neopolitan shake. Jetta talked your boyfriend into agreeing to a threesome with your and your best friend? You better keep it coming; because all 3x3s and animal style fries in the world will not get that harrowing; harrowing memory out of my fucking head.  While the life of a secret menu-aire may seem glamorous; it does have it pitfalls. Occasionally I send out for a protein burger (comes wrapped in a lettuce bun) and instead get a 2x2 with no condiments. Or I asked for \""extra toast\"" and got a little baggie of slightly burnt buns. Oh; and who can forget the time I sent out for In N Out and got back a bag of McDonald's and a scolding on how it is very mean to write down an order with items that aren't on the menu. That's how I discovered McDonald's southwest chicken sandwich.   Following the secret menu is like following UFOs or cryptozoology. It's rewarding when you find a location that provides your mysterious heart attack sandwich; but other times you (or the person you sent to get your lunch) end up looking like an idiot in front of the cashier.   Still; the thrill of the plunder is worth the hassle and risk of embarrassment. Sure; that calorie bomb was never meant for human consumption; but fuck it; it was on the secret menu. It's practically a treasure.   I guess that's the ultimate joy of the In N Out experience. Getting something that (at least we are lead to believe) the average casual fast foodie does not get to experience. Fuck the casual eaters. Only real drive-thru pirates deserve the good shit.""",0
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,No matter which one you go to; In n out is the best burger place on the planet (thus far).  The burgers and fries are made to order. And delicious.  I highly recommend the double double which has double meat and cheese.  The burgers are loaded with good veggies and sauce; the fries fresh and crsip; the shakes thick and creamy.  I recommend In n Out for anyone who likes to eat; likes burgers; and has hunger.,0
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,The food and service here can not be matched; my only problem with this place is their parking lot.  It is poorly designed and can only be accessed on 83rd avenue.  If their parking lot connected to the rest of the shopping center it would allow for better flow of traffic.  Prices and quality of food though are an A+,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,With the exception that they should have made this one twice as big (you can hardly find a seat around noon) I've never once had a wrong order and sometimes I order some complex stuff. Employees are like; overly happy which is actually sometimes annoying; but oh well. But yeah; In N Out hardly even needs a review... everyone knows the food is always incredible.  And Amanda B is right! There used to be a little green house that was on this lot before they finally gave in.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,This place was a zoo.  They have one of the worst drive thru set ups in my opinion.  Anyways the line was too long so I went in.  They workers are like a fine tuned machine.  They have the process down.  One makes the burger; another person adds the fries; another makes the drinks.  It went really quickly.  We had a lot of custom burgers and they got our order correct despite it.    Only complaint is the fries were cold and soggy by the time we made it home 10 minutes later.  If you get fries you better dine in.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,It's an In-N-Out; so you know what you're getting.  It seems to always be packed any time of day; but you still get pretty fast service.  Food quality is totally consistent no matter what.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,As good as I remembered; very busy;fast service; friendly staff. The only thing; and his minor I wish they had malts instead of shakes.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,I would give it 4.5 stars but it's a 4 star rating. In-N-Out Burger is a very clean place. I went there last Wednesday and I ordered the Double Double with just meat and cheese; a fry; and a chocolate shake. The service was very nice. They welcomed us to their restaurant and that made me excited. They have very good manners. The other person with me had a regular Double Double; a fry; and a lemonade. The was very juicy and tender because the bun was fresh; the meat was tender; and fresh; and once you chew on it; after about 2 bites; this burst of cheese flavor enters your mouth and takes over the whole taste of the burger in a good way. The cheese flavor was very pleasing to my taste buds. The fries were greasy; but there were pretty good; because the flavor of the salt mixed in with the potato was a really enjoyable taste in my mouth. The fries were very crunchy and it tastes like a real potato fry; but it   also tasted like a McDonald's fry. The shake was very rich; and tasty. You can feel that it's real ice cream in your mouth; plus you can really taste the milk in the ice cream shake. I literally couldn't take my mouth off of the straw. It was that good. The only reason this isn't 5 stars; is that it is a little pricy; but it's worth it mostly. It's not Fuddruckers; or Five Guys pricy.,1

yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria on the corner a somewhat large intersection though it stands apart from other stores within that area such as the JC Penny Home Store.  Therefore with that being said; be careful when you take the entrance for the JC Penny Home Store thinking you'll get to In-N-Out Burger because the restaurant has its own entrance and exit.   There's tables and chairs outside for dining purposes with misters if that's your thing or you can dine inside though when we went; inside was a bit crowded as it was a Friday night.  The restaurant was clean and there's always staff going around cleaning up the floors and tables.  Some in my party thought the place had a 50's look to it reminiscent of Freddy's Frozen Custard but I didn't get that feeling.   Parking can be a little difficult to find on a busy night like Friday as parking is somewhat limited to their parking lot which seemed small in size.  If you're doing the drive-through be prepared for a long line as we witnessed. (-1)  Menu - The menu is very simple - double double; cheeseburger; or hamburger.  Then there's fries; shakes; or beverages.  I have to say that I am really a fan of this concept of simple menus!  With that being said; we still had to step aside as there was one in my party who couldn't decide what they wanted.    Service - The staff was spectacularly nice and friendly!    Food - I ordered the double-double meal and substituted my drink for a strawberry shake. The burger was divine!  Juicy and mouthwatering with fresh lettuce; tomato; and of course American cheese which was dripping over the sides...my oh my oh my!  The french fries was fresh and lightly salted and tastes as if they just went out and picked the spuds; cut it up and put it right in the fryer!  The shake tasted like it was from real ice-cream - creamy and smooth; and most of which was consumed by someone in my party who; once they got a taste of it; couldn't put it down.  Suffice it to say; I was only left with a quarter of it to drink despite repeatedly offering to buy them one...that's how good the shake was!  Definitely will be coming back here for more!,1

yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,This is all American food.  I'm calling it Ethnic; because American is an ethnic group too and they don't have a fast food grouping.  Hey!  I'm a California girl; we love our burgers the In & Out way.  Always fresh; always made to order and always made right.   Drive through or dine in.  The drive through is surprisingly fast.  The inside dining gets crowded at meal times but it usually works out that by the time your food is ready a table opens up.  On a nice day there are plenty of outside tables to take advantage of.  Kid friendly dining with lots of high chairs.  They keep it pretty clean even when it's busy.   Best fries on the planet because they are made ultra fresh right before your eyes.  Watch the guy take a  fresh potatoe and slice it and then fry it.  I like mine extra well done.  Not a problem at I&O.  They make it the way you want it.    Add on grilled onions with or without your slice of raw onion.  No prob. Full slices of onions (none of those dehydrated minced things that look like lice on your burger); rich ripe red tomatoes (not pink; red and ripe)and whole leaves of lettuce (none of that shredded stuff with brown edges).  The buns are baked fresh everyday too.  Fresh; fresh; fresh and juicy.  On a diet?  In and Out invented the protein burger over 40 years ago.  All the other fast food places are imitators.  In California we called it a Rabbit Burger.  All your burger goodies stacked on whole lettuce leaves and lovingly wrapped.  Messy and yummy.  Animal Style - it's not on the menu but you can make your burger or fries Animal Style - adds grilled onions and more condiments. On your fries it adds cheese; onions and thousand island sauce - Wow!  They (unfortunately) charge extra for it now.  Oh well; if you tell em to leave off the cheese they will not charge the extra $1.85 on to the fries though.  Top off your meal with a real made from ice cream shake.  Everyone else has finally followed suit on this one too.  Used to be you could only find ice milk being used.  I & O always used ice cream and still does.  Nice fat straws too - not those skinny ones that you have to suck your brains out to get a good slurp.  Pick up a cool t shirt and bumper sticker while you are there and show your burger love to the world!  Dang!  I've made myself hungry writting this reveiw.  Think I will head on over for some comfort food!   Sunday through Thursday 10:30 a.m.-1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday 10:30 a.m.-1:30 a.m.,1
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Check your bags folks!!! I drove the 40 min round trip journey to get the highly requested In-and-Out for dinner. Like an idiot I didn't check my bag before driving home. Unlike other fast food chains this place has never messed up my order so I've been lulled into a false sense of security.   Upon arrival at home I discovered 4 burgers for my 5 person family. Like any good mother I graciously handed my children food and watched them savor each bite (while secretly wanting to throw an adult temper tantrum).  Lesson learned? Always check your bag no matter how on point a place usually is. Everyone assures me their food was delicious. I can vouch the fries were good...but alas I am out not only my money; but my personal dinner as well.,0
yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,As a native Californian; I have a weird superiority complex about In N Out (most of us do). I think it's the best fast food burger chain and is miles ahead of Five Guys and Shake Shack; etc.   This location is kind of situated in a weird place. It's not actually in the target shopping center; even though it's at the corner of it. You have to enter separately through the entrance closest to the store. Weird; I know.   Aside from the odd entryway; this location serves consistently quality food. My go-to order: hamburger protein style w/ no onions; fries; and a small Dr. Pepper. Delicious!!,0
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,Its a great place.. Just walking distance form the thunderbird business school . The good thing is- lot of meat at good price. The service is also very awesome. The attendants were very helpful and are present to suggest and guide you.,1
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,Very slow service.  This location used to be great but the last few times I've gone the service has been very slow.  The line can be all the way to the door and you will see one or two employees working the line and the rest are wondering around the kitchen.,0
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,This is my favorite Chipotle to go to because it's the closest one to my work. I call in orders all the time and the staff always has it ready to go. Even when I don't have a pick up order they always move quickly to get everyone through the line; which is great because when I'm hungry I want everyone out of my way!,1
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,I have eaten at a number of chipotles and this is by far the slowest and most poorly trained personnel I have ran into. No sense of urgency with a line going out the door. Burrito makers out a little of some things a lot of other things. A franchise works because you can expect the same service and product from each place. Not the case here.,0
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,"I've been going here on and off for two years now...the service has really gone downhill the last couple times I have been in.  As has already been mentioned; they often have one person working the line; one cashier(who can only cashier and nothing else) and usually have at least one or two employees \supervising\""...meanwhile the person on the line is backed up and apologizing to everyone waiting in line.  This backup most likely leads to the mistakes that have occurred; like not giving salad dressing with salad the last two times I picked up there...just disappointed in general""",0
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,My favorite 'fast food' joint! Everyone here is friendly and if you're buying two orders; they'll let you split the $1.80 guacamole onto both; which is fine by me since it's such a big glob of guacamole! Everything's always fresh and delicious!,1
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,We stepped out of line for a few minutes to wait for a new batch of rice. The staff was very apologetic about the delay; and ended up comping our entire meal! What amazing customer service. Thanks; Glendale Chipotle -- we'll be back soon!,1
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,I came into this Chipotle late last night not knowing it was teacher appreciation night (buy one get one free for all education employees).  I weathered the long line because I happen to work in education and I was exceptionally hungry.  The staff seemed understandably overwhelmed; but remained pleasant even with a line out the door after 9:00 PM.  I've come in at other times as well and have yet to have a bad experience.  Great staff; great service!,1
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,Don't go in near closing time. Had to repeat my order twice to several people only to find that they missed pieces of it when I got home. Frustrated. All I really wanted was a salad and they couldn't give me my vinaigrette.,0
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,Omg. Busy? Fuck yes. Awesome food that's very delicious? Oh fuck yes. People need to shut the fuck up about how busy this place is. Be patient and get some good ass bowl and go home. Extra guacamole? Yes please; and I use their app and it is seriously awesome! Just order ahead and pick up. Can it be more amazing?,1
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,The place was slow for 3 pm which I figured .. But usually Chipotle is always fast and im out the door in 3 min even with 20 people in line ...   This time we had 1 couple in front of us and me and my girlfriend amd we were there for like 12 min!!!!   Besides the slow service which is probably due to short staff ; the food was excellent and fresh!!!,0
JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,I love eating here; as the food tastes fresh and it is always consistent. The Guacamole is delicious and the chips are always crunchy. My favorite is the burrito bowl with spicy Barbacoa meat and all the toppings. The service has always been good and the manager very nice.,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,"Let me be clear and direct in this review: I am a MAN and when I go to Chipotle I do not order a salad or a hand full of chips.  I order a BURRITO; with MEAT.  I have eaten at over FOUR Chipotles; which basically makes me an expert of Chipotle; burritos; and all food in general.  One of the greatest things about Chipotle is consistency; you can walk into a Chipotle in anywhere in the world and you know that your food is going to be fresh and delicious.  What you don't necessarily know though; is the attitude.  Is this a Chipotle where everyone is happy and burritos are being tossed joyously from one person to another in celebration of food preparation?  Or is this Chipotle run by a dirty; filthy man who hates you simply for being alive; and will follow you out to your car and mug you?  Nobody knows.  Except me; because I've eaten at this one several times.  This is a magnificent Chipotle.  The people are good spirited; helpfully construct your burrito quickly; and pleasantly.  Sometimes I go into this Chipotle and I'm like; \Eh; not having such a great day - maybe a burrito will make me happy\"" and do you know what?  I go into this place; and everybody is happy and working and it's like; \""Yeah... yeah now I'm feeling a little better.  Maybe things aren't so bad.  Maybe she still loves me.\""  So to summarize; this is a great Chipotle.  It's bright; friendly; ample parking; and the same fresh and delicious ingredients you expect.""",1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Oh Chipotle; I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo; with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  I've been to many locations; and all are clean; food quality is excellent; service is friendly and professional; and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you; my friend.,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,I've eaten at many Chipotle locations many times; both in Tucson and Phoenix. This is easily my favorite location.  The cashier is friendly; the food service is prompt. The food is usually cooked well and portions are generous! The fajitas are a bit undercooked every now and then; but they make up for it in friendly customer service.,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Chipotle. Fast. Healthy; or not (depending on what you're in the mood for). I love the consistency of service and quality across locations. I grew up in Colorado and have enjoyed many meals at the original location by the University of Denver. No matter what location visit; you will receive delicious food made with quality ingredients.   I was always a chicken burrito with extra rice; black beans; corn salsa; lettuce and cheese kind of gal. Most recently I've fallen in love with the salad. Romaine lettuce with all the burrito toppings you prefer.   My latest creation is chicken; fajita veggies; pico de gallo; corn salsa with a tiny bit of cheese; hot red chili salsa and dressing on the side. I take this creation home; put it in a big bowl; toss everything together and devour. The marinade from the chicken and the juices from the salsa and veggies create an awesome dressing. I dip my fork in the side of salsa and vinegarette before each bite; providing just the right amount of tang and spice.   The combinations are endless. I dream of Chipotle.,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,The food is good and the customer service is fantastic!,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Honestly this location is the only Chipotle I have ever received poor service at.  When they put sour cream in my burrito after me not asking for it due to the allergic reaction eating it would cause; they were very rude about me saying I did not want it.  When I asked to speak to a manager they were even less helpful and pretty much told me my service did not matter to them.  This one poor experience was enough to make me never return to any Chipotle location again.,0
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Stopped by for a Chipotle fix this evening..awesome service. I waited 2-3 minutes for fresh steak and they threw in a free cup of soda for the wait. Clean; friendly and quick. This is exactly how a franchise should be run.,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,We dine here often and Chipotle really nails its concept and execution - predictable experience with high quality food and great service.,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Stopped in for a quick take out order last night; and this location did not disappoint me at all.  They didn't make fun of me; or give me a dirty look when I have them my ridiculous special order of salad with chicken; steak; no cheese; black beans on the side; red salsa; a dash of corn salsa.   Thanks for cooperating.  In other news; the restaurant was clean; the beverage bar was wiped down; and the tabasco bottles were all wiped down and clean too. I hate when people steal those tabasco bottles though...there seemed to be some of the good flavors missing. Boo.,1
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Dang- worlds strongest margarita here! Most people don't know they even serve Margs here. I always thought they were wine margs but the guy who made mine says they are made with actual tequila. I ordered 1 and I thought I got roofied it was so strong. Anyhoo- good service; good food; good prices and good chill location- not too many people at all.,1

R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Rude staff. Always screw up online orders. Never ready on time.,0
R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,"I'm a sucker for good service.  When you walk in this chipotle; the staff look up; making eye contact with you and say \Hello\"".  From the very beginning I feel welcome and comfortable which is always nice when I am ready to dine out.   The steak burrito I enjoyed had a little kick to it which was nice.  I'm not a huge spice fan or can even tolerate spicy food but this was different.    With great service coupled with great food; I'll return sooner than later.""",1
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,I was craving some tacos (San Diego withdrawal symptoms) and had this place bookmared.  It was on the way home so I stopped.  The line was pretty deep and took about 15 minutes before I placed my order.  I ordered 2 pollo tacos; 3 carne asada tacos; one mini carne asada quesadilla and one mini pollo quesadilla.  Total for all that food was only $9.00!   Its $1.00 per taco and $2.00 per quesadilla. Here is how they were................  Pollo Taco-  This was my favorite of the bunch.  They have great tortillas and they top them with grilled chicken; guacamole; cabbage and hot sauce.  The cabbage threw me for a loop at first but it actually worked with these kind of tacos.  These tacos are super duper small....2 biters.  For a buck; they are fine.  Carne Asada Taco-  Same prep as the pollo.  The carne asada was flavored decent.  My tacos did have some gristle and fat in them.  They were fair.....compared to some spots in SD; nowhere close; but for Phoenix; they were decent.  Quesadillas-  These were topped the same way as the tacos but cheese and another tortilla was added.  Next time; I might just get cheese/meat.  The cabbage made these quesadillas worse.  Weird texture issues lol.    Service was friendly enough.  Price was good but I was not blown away.  TONS of people were coming and going though so its pretty popular and may be the best Phoenix has to offer.  If so; Ill accept it but Ill continue to dream of SD taco shops!  That's about it.  Nothing super positive to say; and nothing negative to say.  It was A-OK!,1

_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Hands down; the best Mexican street food EVER!! Run by the nicest; sweetest people. Best carne asada tacos I've ever had. Blow's Americas taco shop out of the water. (Sorry America; your food is still good) impeccable service; get there early though. Lines are long and can take a while since only one order taker for the line outside and the drunks inside Charlie's.,1

_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,This is the best carne asada I have ever had!!  It is the embodiment of perfection when it comes to carne asada.  Get extra meat if you order a burrito; it's just a dollar more.  Or get a bunch of street tacos (they're $1!!).  The quesadilla (with carne asada of course) is out of this world.    The line is LONG on weekend nights; especially late.  I'm not sure what the hours are; I believe it is just late at night.  I have waited over an hour for this.  I have left (extremely disappointed) when I knew the wait would likely be quite a bit longer than that.  More than one person has told me that they don't particularly like carne asada in general; but this place is out of this world.  I'd give it more than 5 stars.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection. To begin the carne asada has great flavor with a slightly charred and crispy exterior; but still manages to maintain some tenderness on the inside. The cabbage; guacamole; and salsa are a necessary addition to this masterpiece of a taco. And just when you think you have it all... bam! Grilled onions complete one of the best tacos in Phoenix. On top of it all; these bad boys are only $1 a piece.   Now on to the less glamorous side of Taqueria Los Yaquis; or the underbelly if you will. The establishment is inconspicuously housed just west of 7th Ave on Camelback Rd under a tent with some plastic tables and sporadic misters outside of Charlies gay bar. Here you will find some flaming fairies and hordes of legit Mexicans flocking in from all angles. Once you reach your destination you can watch the cooks working tirelessly in a food truck (one of the cleanest I've seen) to prepare you meat-filled pockets of love. God bless them.   There are two ordering lines: one is literally a hole-in-the-wall inside Charlie's and the other a general line outside which accommodates all. This dual line and alternating order-taking results in ridiculously long waits of up to 20-30 minutes. I prefer to go on Sunday afternoons when it gets real; and a lil' less... uh... gay.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Just got home from my 3rd time at this place. I ordered...  Quesadilla.. Cheese is not melted all the way and the bag had no hot sauce; nor was I offered any.  Asada burrito.. Meat was cooked; then stored in the fridge; then taken out and put in a tortilla. The drive home was less 3 minutes and no way does meat cool to fridge temp; wrapped in a tortilla; wrapped in foil; and bagged; this fast.  What I don't understand is why this took 10 minutes and what the hell were they doing with the grill?   If hind sight was 20/20 I would have gone elsewhere..,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Very good asada tacos which is not easy to find in Phoenix. Both quesadillas are also very good; the mini and the full-size. It's only a four star because of the limited menu choices. The pricing is about as cheap as your going to find.  This place delivers excellent flavor and a good price point. The service is quick and helpful. The employees make you feel welcome and at home even though it's outdoors.   If you are craving Mexico style street tacos this is about as close as you're going to get in the Phoenix area. If anybody knows a better taco stand please let me know.,1
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,You can't imagine how delighted I am to find such a place in Arizona! My friends and I have resorted to fast food late night meals after a night of going out and that's just depressing.   The truck is located right outside Charlie's gay bar on the corner of Camelback and Florence; right before you hit Florence. You will see the sign for Charlie's first so just pull into their parking lot. The club was bumpin that night so the lot was full but the taco stand had almost no line Sunday at 11pm. Even though there were security guards by the club and my friend was a guy; I still felt a little nervous because there were definitely some shady looking people hanging out nearby. So if you're a chick make sure to go with a group. Don't let this deter you from going though; as we sat and ate there were plenty of groups coming by (couples; college kids; high school kids) so I felt more at ease.   As for the food; I was craving  a hot dog but I obviously wanted the tacos. Solution= I got both (sorryimafatty). Skip on the hot dog unless you're really craving it; its just a grilled ball park dog and I prefer mine all beef. Came with a side of Doritos which I gave to my friend.   TACOS HOWEVER were delicious! I got mine with all the toppings; the red sauce they put on there is spicy! It burned but that roasted red chili pepper taste is so good. I got the pollo and asada.. both were good but I definitely preferred the flavor of the asada more. My friend got the Asada burrito and devoured it! Burrito had the same toppings as the tacos: red sauce; guac; cabbage and onions. Also ordered a Horchata which was meh: watered down; gritty; and not very sweet or cinnamon-y .   Prices are more than reasonable; service is very friendly and food is excellent! They're only open Thursday to Sunday nights; I will for sure be back. Maybe I'll check out the bar this time too ;),1
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,You can't imagine how delighted I am to find such a place in Arizona! My friends and I have resorted to fast food late night meals after a night of going out and that's just depressing.   The truck is located right outside Charlie's gay bar on the corner of Camelback and Florence; right before you hit Florence. You will see the sign for Charlie's first so just pull into their parking lot. The club was bumpin that night so the lot was full but the taco stand had almost no line Sunday at 11pm. Even though there were security guards by the club and my friend was a guy; I still felt a little nervous because there were definitely some shady looking people hanging out nearby. So if you're a chick make sure to go with a group.

_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Food: These both got a little messy to eat so ask for extra napkins!  - Taco asada - beef; cabbage; guacamole; salsa; and hot sauce over a mini flour tortilla ($1). Tasty and dirt cheap! - Quesadilla Pollo - chicken and cheese with cabbage; guacamole; salsa and hot sauce sandwiched between 2 mini flour tortillas ($2). Also; tasty and cheap!   Service: Fast and friendly. This food truck spot opens at 7:30; we got here at 7:38 and all the table were taken. We had to wait for people to leave so we can quickly grab their table. I'll definitely come back. A tasty meal for $4; I also ordered bottled water ($1).,1

_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,It's a little sad how many times I've been here and been buzzed or flat out drunk. And when I wake up the next morning with burrito wrappers in bed with me I think; Hey; at least *something* came home with me last night. Then I eat the extra burrito I drunk ordered and call it a good day.  Okay; seriously; this place is wunderfundle! Whenever I'm heading home late on a Friday; this is my final stop before going home. While the tacos are probably some of the best I've ever stuffed in my face; the bean and cheese burrito is my standard order. Two of those bad boys; actually. And in a pinch; they're in the lot with Charlie's. You know; for times when I want more than a burrito in bed.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Good bang for your buck. One dollar tacos? Are you kidding me?! Well; they are pretty small. Still; order 5 and pay $5; and leave full. Not so bad.   I'd heard good things about this stand behind Charlie's; and finally got around to being in the area during their limited business hours. I tried some of the carne asada tacos; some of the pollo tacos. Both were delicious. I also ordered their horchata. Also good.  This is by no means; a fancy place to take a date; but the food is very good; and you'll feel better about giving this small business your money than it's competitors; namely Taco Bell and Del Taco.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Coming from Los Angeles; I am pretty up to speed on good Mexican food. After a night out at Charlies; we discovered this place that is basically attached to the bar (which is an awesome concept).  Originally; I did not order anything because I was not that hungry; but after having a bite of my friends chicken burrito; I immediately changed my mind.  Normally; burritos that you get from food trucks are a lot of beans and rice with some chunks of chicken mixed in. However; the burritos from this place are around 95% meat; which provides for a very filling and tasty meal.  Overall; I was very shocked at the great seasoning and flavorful taste of the food here and would definitely recommend it; drunk or otherwise.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,This place has the best tacos!  Given that it's set up outside of a bar; you would think it wasn't the best in the world; but they really are yummy.  It's actually set up much like a permanent food truck but they have ample picnic style seating.   This is the place to go if you want some post-clubbing snacks at a pretty reasonable price.  They even have an ordering window which is located in outside area in Charlies.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,I think this is the best taco truck in Phoenix. Order the mini quesadillas. Yum. And; if you are a low carb eater order the carne asada/chicken combo plate with no tortillas. Super yum. Sometimes late at night the line is long but it is worth it.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,You really can't get a better deal than $1 tacos. After nearly risking your life parking off the street just wait in line for 15 minutes to place your order. I have to admit that the hype lured me in... Anything that takes 15 minutes just to order better be worth it.   It really is. Yum!.. I personally think it's the corn tortillas which they heat to perfection. I mean; who wants a soggy taco? Very zesty salsa; thanks for the extra limes; and the asado and pollo both are succulent. Very tasty.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Wasn't blown away as suggested by some reviews; but pretty good tacos for the cheap price.  But they are not the best I've ever had and the service is very slow. I didn't think the line was too long and was surprised to find myself still in line 15 minutes later. Disappointed to see only carne asada or chicken choices. The tacos were a great size for a late night snack. I found the mini quesadillas to be too salty; although it did have a nice crisp.  The salsa roja had a nice spicy kick.  The horchata was too creamy and sweet. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. But if I were in the area and had the nighttime munchies; it'd be better than a 24 hr fast food joint. Just be ok with waiting up to 45 minutes for some tacos.,0
_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,"4.5 stars? That's ridiculous. This place deserves 5 solid stars. Period. Don't argue with me. A friend of mine introduced me to this place about 3 or 4 months ago and I have since gone back an embarrassingly amount of times. Actually; fuck that. I'm not embarrassed; it's tasty as HAIL. Hands down; the best street tacos in AZ. Not even joking. Every single person I introduce to this place becomes just as obsessed as I do. I go about every other week at this point on Thursday or Sunday. I honestly do not order anything other than the $1 tacos. I have no doubt their other items are really amazing as well; but I have no desire to cram anything into my mouth other than those sweet; sweet tacos. I usually order a mix of carne asada; pollo and \vegetarian\"" tacos; which is just black beans. I have never once been disappointed. They do have weird hours and are located next to Charlie's; so if you go here during peak hours (i.e.; when the club lets out at 2am); you'll will be faced with a very large line. Things can get a little slow when it's busy. But hey; these people are creating ART. So you shut your pie hole and wait in line. The lovely lady who runs the register is extremely sweet and is a damn pro at dealing with the drunk fashionable men and random hobos who stroll in off the street looking for a handout.  But really; you haven't had a legit taco in AZ unless you've been here. America's Taco Shop? Nah. Gallo Blanco? Puh-leez. Dig the loose change out of the bottom of your purse/car cup holder and hit this place up for a taco or 5.""",1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,It's Good; it's clean and the service just plain amazing for a fast food joint! My favorite item off the menu is the grilled chicken garden salad. Second fav is the spicy chicken sandwich. I'm addicted to the waffle fries. They actually taste like a potato! I know; crazy huh?   My kids love it; I like it so here we are.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Always the best chicken in town! Love that their French fries are prepared on a dedicated fryer making great for me being gluten free. If the drive through line is long I just park and go in for quick service. All the staff are extremely friendly.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,"If anyone was ever been to Chick-fil-A; you'll notice a few things..  1.  How incredibly polite their employees are \Hi; how may I serve you today?\"" 2.  How good the food is 3.  How polite they remain...  We had lunch here this past weekend and once again a very nice young tween took our order with a smile from ear to ear.  I paid; and shortly our food was ready to go.   I like to eat mayonnaise with my chicken nuggets while my girlfriend eats a mixture of their chick-fil-a sauce and the Polynesian sauce.  It's good; trust me..    The place was packed; so my girlfriend stood to scope out a table when one would be available.  She found it.  We sat in the most perfect spot for people watching.. I love to people watch. I could do it all day.  Funny moment though...  One of the employees dropped one lonely nugget on the ground and for ten minutes; we sat and watched people walk over this one nugget.  The employee that dropped it stepped over it.. (not exagerating) 8 times.  He kept looking at us like \""What??\""  ...we just grinned.  It was fun.  Finally he picked it up.  Good place; good food; good times.""",1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Always fast service; hot food; friendly service!,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Great food. Great service. Friendly staff. There's nothing like the original sandwich!,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Awesome service & it's always my go to fast-food choice. Chicken is always crispy as are the fries.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,I really wished we had one in Vegas; but maybe that's why it's much more delicious since we don't have it. I am a sucker for their nuggets....yum! The only thing about this place is that it is closed on Sundays. BOO and we have to go up to the counter for refills. BUT really who can resist some waffle fries dipped in a variety of dipping sauces? YUMMY!  Service is always good and every Chick fil A I've been to is clean. Yay for good chicken and fries!   PS. Try the soft ice cream...that's pretty delicious too!,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,I have had some good experiences at this Chick-fil-A; but I have had a couple bad experiences that I seem to remember more.  To say something positive about the restaurant; the employees certainly are very pleasant and polite. It is actually pretty surprising for a fast food type place.  However; I ordered from the drive-thru a few nights ago with my wife and we both ended up feeling awful after eating their food. All I know is that it will be a long while before we are willing to give Chick-fil-A another chance.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Very Yummy Spicy Cgicken Sandwich cole slaw was very tasty good service a little pricey but worth it!!,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,"Pretty Awesome place!  It's very difficult to hide the label: FAST FOOD; but i think chic-fil-a does a pretty good job trying. The place is always clean and the service is really nice by everyone working there. I don't really go to places like this; but this was a warm welcome! Go here if you want a \healthier\"" alternative to most fast food places while not giving up taste; quality; and service""",1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,"Ok I think the only reason I am reviewing a fast-food joint is to get my review numbers higher ;)  With that said; this place was pretty darn good!  I have lived in AZ for 2 years now; and neither my boyfriend or I had gotten into a chik-fil-a. So after a long flight last night; we went through the drive-through for some quick dinner.  Wow! I was impressed! Quick; efficient; and very friendly service. All white chicken; cooked to perfection (who woulda thought?) and the fries were so much fun!! They gave us a ton of different sauces; and my boyfriend made fun ot me for telling them it was our \first time\"" eating there.   We both got their GIANT chocolate shakes... I would have liked it to be a little bit more chocolate-y. Everything was good though. After the deluxe sandwich and fries; I couldn't even get halfway through the shake.  Would go again if I was craving fast food!""",1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Dooooooooode; I'm in love with this place; Absolutely the best customer service you could ever ask for. The food is delicious; fresh and just yummy in general. I go here as often as possible. They have the best fries! The best grilled chicken sandwiches! And I love their honey mustard barbecue sauce; I find myself eating like 7 or 8 packets of that stuff.  Anyhoo; the only bad thing is the parking; it's always takes like 5 minutes to park and sometimes it's really packed when you go inside; it's really crowded. But that's what you get with good food:),1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,We stopped going to this Chick-Fil-A.  The owner told us that they didn't have time during lunch (and we got their early) to make our Wrap sandwiches without any chicken or cheese; as we request them.  The staff used to make them for us on previous occasions and they were very gracious to do so.    The staff here really is sweet; therefore; we were shocked by the owners response to our order.  We gave up meat and dairy two years ago to get healthier and it didn't mean giving up going to our favorite restaurants.  We just modify our choices wherever we go and most places are very accommodating.   People that want to eat unhealthy have the right to order the fried chicken sandwich; fries; etc. and those of us that care about our vascular system and not having Crestor prescribed to our children at age ten; have the right to order to fit our lifestyle too.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,I love the food here. I came to this location and the line was a mile long; they handled it so well; that I was through it; with food on hand; faster than it takes a Starbucks to make me a Frap! The service is always good and everyone seems to always be in a great mood here. I recommend the original chicken sandwich with extra pickles.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Always crowded; always delicious; always closed on Sunday.  Hands down the best tasting; juiciest and yummiest chicken nuggets ever. Dipped in Chick-fil-a sauce; and I'm happy! Not a fan of their waffle fries...never have been; never will. This place is always busy; no matter when you come...because all the food is made fresh to order. Well worth the wait.   Just tried their fresh squeezed lemonade with Splenda and it is soooo good!,0
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Great food and service. Including breakfast. Clean and well run with staff that seems to care about their customers.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Employees are always a pleasure to talk to. They go out of their way to help you. It's refreshing to stop by and see people happy to help you and go above and beyond for you. I truly enjoy stopping by. Food is amazing and service always makes it better.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Incredible service; so clean and friendly! Thanks for helping weary travelers!,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Incredible service...  From taking your order at the counters to asking you if you want a refill when you look like you are finished and ready to go.  Love it!    The quality of the food is always consistent and delicious chicken.,1

DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted with a warm friendly smile and hello! As packed as this location is I was surprised at how fast my order was filled. The chicken deluxe was the best sandwich I have had in a long time. you can tell that the smiles are genuine and they are truely greatful for my patronage.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,New spicy chicken sandwich rocks!  They started taking orders in person at the drive-thru during lunch time rush to push customers through quicker.  This place is always clean; and the service is beyond any other fast food place.  Plus all sandwiches are under 500 calories!  Oh and the lemonade here is heaven; not that crap you get in the fountain machines at normal places.,1

On a side note; the bathrooms and premises are always sparkling clean; making you actually want to sit down and enjoy a meal on premises.""",1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Had a rather unpleasant experience with the service and food at this location. Usually Chick Fil A has good service and fresh food; but this location was lacking of those.   Yes; they were busy but there is no reason for a cashier to give an attitude to a customer. After I asked politely to change my drink order; the female cashier shouldn't have rolled her eyes. I guess service in Phoenix is going down....  Lastly; fries weren't fresh or warm. Big disappointment. This location lost our business!,0

DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Great food and fast friendly service.  Try the Grilled Chicken Club.  It is so juicy no condiments are needed.,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Love this place. It is one of my favorite lunch destinations. The staff is always sweet to the point it almost hurts your teeth! You can tell customer service is a top priority. My only complaint is that they have the slowest drive thru in the world. Once sat for 26 minutes in the drive-thru. You can't exactly leave it is taking too long either. I gotta say the food is so good though it is worth the wait. Try the honey roasted BBQ. Delicious!,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Food and service were spot on. Well trained employees!,1
DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,I love this restaurant. You can get fast food; without being treated like you're eating at a fast food restaurant.  There are live; growing flowers on every table; free wi-fi; impeccably kept restrooms and dining area; little cups of cheerios to keep small fry entertained while waiting for meals; the list goes on and on. Every Wednesday is family night; with a different entertainer like a baloon artist (who won't accept tips); a magician; and others. They help out local schools with fundraising nights and accept any coupon; expired or not. These are just a few of the reasons that this place deserves five stars.  Amazing  (they also do online ordering. How cool is that?),0
-B3bkPTP8jyAs266Dk7VvA,Fasts friendly service very clean and always a tasty burger!,1
-B3bkPTP8jyAs266Dk7VvA,It's all about execution; baby!  As an operations guy I really appreciate the execution I see at In & Out burger again and again.  Since moving to AZ I have made probably 15 total visits to In & Out burger spread over 5-6 locations.    Not once has there been the slightest mistake on my order.  Not once has an employee been anything less than polite and efficient.  While In & Out is not the greatest burger on earth it is pretty good and has been 100% consistent across locations and visits.  That's execution; baby.  Stark contrast to a local McDonald's where it has actually become an amusing stat for us to follow.  They have not gotten an order right for us.  Ever.,1
-B3bkPTP8jyAs266Dk7VvA,We tried a few burger joints while on the west coast and noticed this brand of burgers to be on every corner. When we pulled up at this location the line was wrapped around the building; so I assumed--this must be a good burger joint.. Umm wrong. We went inside and the menu is not that big. You can either get just a regular hamburger or a double patty cheeseburger and a few other options. I ordered a double patty cheeseburger. The burger was just ok--nothing spectacular about the taste; maybe I am missing something but five guys had them beat a 101 percent. My husband ordered a strawberry shake; and it tasted like a shake from Burger King---just syrup and ice cream. Last but not least; we placed an order for french fries and they were just gross! The fries we received were hard; crunchy; and they tasted stale. I saw the gentlemen in the back area peeling and cutting the fries to be cooked so the taste of these fries really surprised me. I am not going to spend very long on this review because I wasn't impressed and it didn't seem like this company put much thought into their food or menu.,0
-B3bkPTP8jyAs266Dk7VvA,I just moved here from CA; so you can imagine my delight when i found one of our own here :-)  Just as good as the ones in CA with the added benefit of a shorter line!! We went at 8pm on a Friday (when it would be out the door and around the block in CA) and walked right up to order. Delicious! :-),0

GREAT BURGER AND EVEN BETTER FRIES.........Our 1st Visit was at 10:30 PM on a Weeknight and the Place was Busy!  People eating inside and outside...and lots of Cars in the Drive Through Waiting to place Orders To Go..... Can't wait to return during our next visit to AZ:):),0

I always see lines dozens of cars deep; so I have definitely sat in a 20 minute line to satisfy an intense In-N-Out craving before... however we ventured inside this time and had our food within 5 minutes.  Tip: Supposedly you should ask about a secret menu; which entails something called \Animal Style\""; which is a really saucy-grilled-oniony version of the original. So if you like that; go balls to the wall. Apparently you can get your french fries Animal Style too; which actually sounds pretty good.  Location: This particular location was a real mess. Dirty tables everywhere; crap all over the floors. Real shame too; because there were employees just standing around most of the time.""",1

During a 5 minute period when I ordered and waited for my food; she was sarcastic and degrading to two young people working the registers. The food may be good; but if you treat your staff like crap;  you lose me as a customer! Disgusting. Shame on you; Yael!,0

-B3bkPTP8jyAs266Dk7VvA,In & Out Burger is my FAVORITE.  I could have one of their burgers any day; at any time.  Hands down; my favorite.   DYING for them to expand and come east!!  Reviewing this location in Phoenix as it was the last one I visited.  I was with over a dozen rowdy softball players; and they put together our entire order in no time.  Their locations are always clean; with classic decor and super friendly staff.  I've heard that they pay their employees very well; so they're in turn loyal; and treat the customers (and prepare the food) very well.  The menu is simple; and everything on it is fantastic.  You can't go wrong.,1
-B3bkPTP8jyAs266Dk7VvA,"Just eat there. Its amazing. Oh and order from the \secret menu\"" you can get a mix of flavors for your shake. I personally LOVE LOVE  LOVE the shakes I think they are amazing! Along with the burgers and the fresh cut fries!! MMMMM""",0
plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,My colleagues and I had lunch there today. We all ordered the Chicken Pita and it was delicious! The chicken was greatly marinated. We will be back!,0
plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,This is what I like to call a sleeper restaurant. It's next to a gas station; Has minimal parking but the food and the service can't be beat. I have been a few times and always enjoy going back. The owner is fun to talk to and he will tell you some amazing stories. Stop in and you'll see what I mean.,1
plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,"This little shop next to the Shell gas station is a hidden gem! My brother and I were in the car filling up gas and saw a small cafe next door; \Gyros on Central.\"" I loved the name - reminded of how they name restaurants in New York. We were both starving so we thought to try it out.  AMAZING! I ordered the chicken pita combo and he ordered the gyro combo. Both of our sandwiches were filled up with a hearty amount of meat (love that) and the fries were seasoned; crispy and HOT. Too many times I've ordered combos; and the fries end up soggy and/or cold. My brother loved his food; too. The owner came by to ask how everything was and sat with us for awhile - incredibly nice guy. We both appreciated the hospitality.  And we'll both be back  - you should; too!""",1
plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,First time here! I got a Chicago Dog and a Gyro both were awesome! I was greeted as soon as I walked in.  Service is great! I will be back in 2 weeks; when I am up in this area again!,1
plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,I have been here twice. The first time I got the Veggie Platter. A nice mix of hummus; pita; a little Greek salad and Dolmades. The food is nice; but nothing overly impressive.   On the first visit after ordering and waiting 5 minutes I was told they were out of hummus. What? A Greek place out of hummus?  At any rate I think they scraped the bottom of the barrel and I got some with my meal; but about half of what was pictured in the menu.   I went back again today; only because I was rushed for lunch and thought i'd give them another shot; since the food was ok last time.   I again ordered the veggie platter and was told it would be 20 minutes because they were slammed.  At the time they had three customers waiting that had already ordered. 20 minutes for a meal that has everything already made and just needs to be put in a to-go container. No thanks.   On top of this the staff is not really overly friendly. I'd skip this place.,0
plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,Solid gyro with delicious fries (perfectly cooked) and a good value. Gyro was heaping with meat - could have ordered a second pita and made two sandwiches!  I will be back - for sure.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"Paper hats. Giant safety pins for aprons. 13+ employees scurrying about.  Those were my first impressions upon entering my first In-N-Out Burger; to eat for the first time.  I've had many times over the years to try In-N-Out on various trips to try this chain but have never really been interested.  Today; however; I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Service was impeccable.  Restaurant was incredibly clean.  Food was a notch above typical fast food.  I enjoyed my cheeseburger; though I'm not a huge fan of the \special\"" sauce (too sweet).  I appreciated the fresh lettuce and tomato.  And I really liked how the wrap your burger to make it simple to eat.  I don't really like fries; so I didn't have those.    All in all; I would definitely choose this place over the national fast food burger chains.  But; I won't crave it nor will I go out of my way for it.""",1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Good food.  Friendly service and always neat and clean.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I got  to give In-N-Out Burger some love. I've been wrestling with a rating on this place for a long time. It's definitely a WIN when you can feed two hungry college aged boys and yours truly for under $15 bucks with some delicious food. They always get your orders right; keep the place clean and are UBER Friendly with fresh delicious burgers. No wonder this place is always mobbed well past the traditional lunch hours with families. Keep up the good work IN-N Out Burger!,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I am from the east coast; so I think I am a little over complementary at this time; but I do like this place.  The service is always top notch and the food is good.  My typical order is the double double animal style with well done animal style fries.  It cannot be beat.  I would recommend to anyone.  One of the best fast food experiences I have had.,1

Had this heavenly goodness for the first time recently. I almost keeled over in delight while sampling the fries. GOODNESS GRACIOUS.   Why has no one told me about this place before?  All french fries should taste like this! I'll never have a fry again elsewhere. Why bother? These are the best kind. Light; crispy but not too crunchy. It didn't feel like grease was involved in frying them. But the pure vegetable oil I later learned that is used. Delightful.  I still can't believe it.   I was cheated growing up eating the mushy drive thru fries of other chains as a child. (Thanks Mom!) I'll save this special treat for special indulgences. Totally worth it. Loved it!  OTHER STUFF + The quality of sound during drive thru order process was crisp/clear. + Staff was super polite; easy to understand.  + Staff was helpful. Cheery! (NYE 11:15pm)""",1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Awesome customer service!  Always consistently good burgers; staff pays attention to details and they give it 110%,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Ahhh; animal style fries. How I've missed you so.  This wasn't the best In-N-Out Burger I've been to; mainly because of the lack of cleaniness of the seating and flooring; but it was still pretty damn good. Keep in mind the secret menu to make your order unique and the envy of the person behind you.  I arrived at 11 PM; which was perfect since there wasn't a line in site. The next day; I arrived at lunch and was overwhelmed with mobs of hormone-induced teenagers waiting to devour every cow and potato in sight. So; make sure you arrive a little early or a little later for meal times. Regardless; it is well worth the wait.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Boy I gotta tell ya - what a HUGE disappointment this place was. I've been dieting for the last 5 months and have finally reached my goal - and then some; so I decided to treat myself (good behavior) and have some fast food. At first I thought Wendy's until I saw that famous In-N-Out sign and pulled right in. The service was impeccable; the food? Not so much. I ordered the single cheeseburger with fries and a root beer. The bun on my burger was greasier than the burger itself - I could barely hold on to it! The fries  -  although hot  -  we're as dry as cardboard and actually tasted like cardboard...even my root beer was weak - how the heck can you screw up a root beer?!?! Five months of hard work and my reward completely and totally sucked. Thanks...I really should have gone to Wendy's - well; next time!,1

g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I know it's a chain but I can't help but love it. Went here for a quick Father's Day drive through bite with the kids.  The first big thing about In-N-Out that I've always loved is that they actually listen and speak with you when you're at the drive through.  They do their greeting and then actually respond to what you say. They're actually listening and interacting. How cool is that for a drive through? I've seen that from time to time at individual locations of other chains but it's pretty much standard here.  Love that.  Then I also love the fact that they're pretty transparent. It's quite cool that they have the big window walls all through the drive through so you can actually see what's going on. I love the fact that they want you to see what they're doing and what the kitchen looks like. It's also way better than looking at a cement wall.  I also love that the food is made to order (no tomatoes; yes onions) every time. And I love the fact that they use quality ingredients (fresh vegetables; fries being just potatoes run through the slicer; fresh ground beef; etc.).  Then I love the fact that they give you a box if you're going to eat in your car and also that they cover your fries with a napkin. Just little touches like that show that someone actually was a bit into what they were doing when they set this business up.  And then; I just love the payoff of the double double and the fresh cut fries. For a quick drive through; can't beat it.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out and this location delivers the goods.  I order my usual Double Double ($3.20) w/Animal Style Fries ($3.40). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-scottsdale?select=pcv1WV4PX5DUax5tcTSZug#pcv1WV4PX5DUax5tcTSZug http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-scottsdale?select=h0r285bh09IY6jVDcNsYww#h0r285bh09IY6jVDcNsYww http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-scottsdale?select=WCcyB294517rhQmOfML9OA#WCcyB294517rhQmOfML9OA  In-N-Out never disappoints.  It always delivers a fresh; tasty Burger.  The sweet/tangy flavor of the Animal Style Sauce makes the Fries & Burgers even more addicting.  This location has great employees (they all do) and it's not as crazy busy as the locations in California & Vegas.  Return Factor - 100%,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"This isn't so much an In n Out review; which I will touch on; but more of an update to a previous Simonmed review (based on an MRI I required). I don't know what MRI stands for but I'm sure it's not something positive or cheerful like Monkey Reads Incyclopedia....Ok Ok...I know it's not spelled correctly...I mean; who really knows how to spell monkey. What I'm saying is that I had GREAT results from my MRI (which I've reviewed along with Dr. Fry who delivered the relieving and wonderful news) and the first \naughty\"" reward I thought of was an In N Out burger. I discovered and devoured them in LA for 16 years and in Phoenix they are more difficult to find. Thank you intersection of FLW and Scottsdale Blvd (further know as ScottsBull). After leaving Dr. Fry's Airpark Medical Center in NoScott with good news I needed something toxic....nicotine; alchohol; perhaps something illegal or; oh; red meat....that's still legal; I think. Burger was amazing. Bun was soft and crisp and buttery where needed; lettuce; tomato an onion were crispier than a November wind blowing off Lake Michigan (pre greenhouse effect) and the accompanying soda hit the spot. Truly; with that 1;000 island sauce action; this was my fast food heaven. And; I forgot how much I LOVE Amercian cheese. Fast food service was impeccible. Clean grounds. And better yet; the cyst on my kidney was A OK....ooo what a subtle ending! Thanks to those yelpers who voiced; er; umm typed their concerns!""",1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"The best burgers of all chainburgers!  Fresh; juicy burgers at a ral low price. A double-double with fries and a softdrink is only 6;25 $.  Order it \animal style\"" to get it grilled with a layer of mustard and served with  grilled onion and extra sauce. Delicious every time!""",0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Simply the best. It was first time ever eating In-N-Out and I was not upset one bit! I had the double cheeseburger with fries animal style. The animal style fries were out of this world and lived up to all of my expectations. Even though this place was packed the customer service was still amazing and I'll be back next year for my annual visit!,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,3 stars:  Good  This review is one man's opinion. And this man's opinion is that In N Out Burger is good.   They let my brother and I inside minutes before the posted opening time of 10:30 a.m.(I assume they don't sell breakfast). It was surreal being the only customers in an In N Out Burger considering they are usually packed. The employees were friendly and hardworking. There was none of the horseplay that I could expect in a fast food restaurant when only a couple of customers are inside.    I ordered the standard cheeseburger meal. With a selection of three meals; the choice was an easy one. Because they make the burger upon order; it took a few minutes from order to eating. No complaints.     In my opinion; the cheeseburger was good but not the best. The fries were decent.    When it comes to fast food; in many instances the ratings of their food is one person's opinion. This person's opinion is that In N Out is 3 stars.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,What can I say that hasn't already been said about In-N-Out Burger? Probably nothing.  I ate here knowing it was going to be my last gluten and dairy inclusive meal for a very long time; so I totally splurged; ordering a burger animal style (minus the cheese); fries; and a strawberry milkshake.  The burger was awesome.  You can get it protein style; wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun; and that's probably what I'll get the next time I'm in town.  The fried onions and the special sauce; as well as the obvious freshness of all the ingredients; proved In-N-Out to be worth the hype and well above Five Guys.  The strawberry milkshake was grand.  The fries were eh.  I'm told they are usually made to order; but I am pretty sure I didn't get a fresh batch.  They were good in that they weren't too salty; but they could have been hotter and crisper; for sure.    In short; animal style; animal style; animal style.  I see now why people are obsessed with this place.  I can't think of a better hangover cure.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I can't say anything negative about this chain. Their food is delicious; the restaurants are always spotless; and the burgers taste unbelievably fresh. I must say that since discovering their secret menu; I am a protein burger convert. I don't order them for diet purposes or to watch what I eat...I just love how they taste.  Something else I love; the staff friendliness  from one restaurant to the next is consistently great and predictable.  A lot of burger joints and other chains could definitely learn a thing or two in terms of freshness; and the training of their staff.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,How much or how little can I say??? Its In-N-Out!!! And we don't have them in Chicago. #1 Animal Style really hit the spot after a long morning of travelling. Great cashier and quick service! It made me happy at 11am! :-),1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Best hamburgers around. We never miss I&O whenever we are out west; They are an inhale-able addiction without the legal ramifications of cocaine. yum yum yum They really have it down. Service is always great. And the fries; oh my.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Great as always.  We were in Scottsdale for a long weekend and this was our best meal!    In-n-out loses one star for me because their fries are not crispy; even if we order them well done.  Other than that; fantastic.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,For fast food burgers; in and out is tough to beat. Ask for your burger animal style and you won't be disappointed. Their fries are just so so. The milkshakes are pretty awesome. In and out always hires very nice people; it is rare to get bad service. I recently went to a nutrition seminar and they said a healthier fast food option is in and out; protein style burgers. It's basically a burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun!,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"I don't know that it's fair for me; as a vegan; to write a review for a burger joint. All I can eat is their fries with grilled onions; but they are always fresh! They're also the only place (that I know of) where I can get a drive-thru 7-Up soda. I only drink soda when I have a sick tummy; so it's nice and convenient to be able to swing by here when I need one.   My family isn't vegan. They love the burgers and animal fries (which are on the \secret\"" menu).    Open late. The drive-thru line gets long; but it goes pretty fast. The workers are always nice; friendly; & smiling. I love how they repeat your order a second time; for accuracy; once you get to the window.   If they ever decide to offer a vegan veggie burger; I would be SO elated!""",1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Burger was quite nummy.  Fries not so great.  Decent price.  Fast service.  Small dining area.  Great people watching.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"RECOMMENDED: My car got sucked into the drive thru by the intergalactic tractor beam so I had to appease it by ordering a Double-Double and some well done fries!  In-N-Out is part of what makes the West Coast the West Coast. I love that they make their burgers fresh to order and only use fresh meat. The fries took a little to adjust to; since I had grown accustomed to the crap other burger joints put in their fries. Not In-N-Out... You can see them cutting up whole potatoes to make their fries.   In-N-Out is known for their \secret\"" menu. My advise is to ask someone in the know or simply read the comments on the listing here in Yelp for some hints and insight.   My personal favorites are the Double Double or the Triple Triple. Simply put... That's 2 patties with 2 slices of cheese or 3 patties with 3 slices of cheese!  I order mine Animal style!  Ask for this and you'll certainly never order it off the menu again.   The North Scottsdale location is easy to get to. It's always clean and the staff is impressive!  It's hard to beat In-N-Out in the fast food burger niche. Enjoy ;-)""",1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Paid a visit to this In-n-Out when I had a craving for a burger. Don't ask why. I was REAAAALLY hungry. Yikes.   So; for my one horrible unhealthy meal for the week; I chose this.  Cheeseburger. Animal Style. Toast. Fries. Diet Coke (Since I'm watching my figure). It was effing delicious.   I did the drive through thing. I waited the customary five minutes; but everything came out FRESH to order; especially the fries. No salt on the fries; which is how I like it. I can salt them as I see fit.   Also; everything was packaged just the way I like it.  In-N-Out....you are what a hamburger is all about.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Get. In. Mah. Belly!   Oh where to begin the ode to In and Out? How about the fact that the meat is fresh and the french fries are freshly cut? Oh; I missed you In and Out! And all the veggies are fresh too? AND the milkshakes are just flat out delish?   Be prepared for many people to share your space; as most likely they share the desire for these delicious burgers. For the same reason; there is usually a line. What is nice about all of this; is the fact that even though it is super busy; the service is still great! People are friendly; and the food is still fresh when you get it.   If you're looking for Chicken or Tofu; this is not the place.   And if you don't feel like going inside; consider the drive through. As you are patiently waiting; there is a massive window allowing you a front row view into the kitchen. Makes me feel a bit like a stalker; but surprisingly entertaining. You will feel as though you are waiting for your last meal on earth...but then again; it may as well be.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Must say my favorite hamburger joint! Too bad I have not seen one of these franchises on the East Coast! Very friendly staff! Easy to read menu! Price cannot be beat for the Food I had ordered! I timed that food was delivered exactly in 10 mins,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,After all the hype; especially that of Anthony Bourdain; I expected heaven between two buns. That unfortunately is not what I got. Cheeseburger was ok--nothing special. I prefer shake shack. Maybe I'm a food snob. But I didn't think there was anything extraordinary about the food. Even my fries were borderline soggy. Not crisp like McDonald's fries. Yes I compared in n out to mcdonalds!,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Good. Fun. Great service for fast food. Not in my top 10 for burger joints.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"Ehhhhhhh. Overhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special; good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh. I'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \secret\"" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is.""",0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"This place is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. I almost always end up getting a Double Double animal style with fries and a root beer. Nice and simple. I call this lunch \heart attack in a bag;\"" as it's about the most unhealthy thing I will consume for lunch. It is; however; very tasty and always fills (or even overfills) me.  Now all praise aside; I would have given a higher rating; except that this place is a little inconsistent. I've gotten a few burgers which were absolutely falling apart; the bun was only halfway covering the innards. I've gotten some pretty soggy fries. And one time they apparently didn't understand that I wasn't eating in my car. Even after I told three people. Granted; I still ate the food. And it was still tasty. It was just rather annoying. Not like I'm paying for top notch service here though!""",0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Great burgers; fries and shakes.  Service is always great regardless of how busy they are.  Friendly and efficient employees!,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Love this location and so close to our house.   Huge dining area and always clean plus the drive thru is quick and efficient.   Come for the burgers which are so inexpensive and you also have to get the fresh cut fries.   The double double burger is huge and throw on some onions and you have one awesome burger.   If you are lucky while in the drive thru you may see them actually cutting the fries.   The service is always top notch and the food comes out quickly.   Got to hand it to them the food is extremely fresh and always tasty and juicy.  I remember when they first opened the drive thru line was about 30-40 minutes long so I dropped my wife at Nordstrom Rack; the kids were small at the time and asleep so I went thru the drive thru in about 45 minutes so my wife got to shop the kids got a good nap and my stomach was happy.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Excellent service abd awesome animal fries and burgers every thing is great fast service,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Simply the best fast food chain...period.  The food is always delicious and consistent; and the customer service is outdone by no one.  The Double Double is absolute perfection.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Simplicity is the key to enjoying this place.  Take a look at the menu.  There's only 5 things you can order.... hamburgers; cheeseburgers; fries; soda and shakes.  That's it.  Nothing much to think about here.      Unlike other fast food joints; they have no chicken; no patty melts; no tacos; no nuggets; no chili; no kids meals; no breakfast; no onion rings; no egg sandwiches; no cookies; no bacon; no curly fries; no coffee; no orange juice; no sliders; no rib sandwiches; no pork products; no ice cream cones; no parfaits; no burritos; no salads; no dollar menu; no value menu and no cherry turnovers.  I think this burger is a winner.  I love a good cheeseburger; but when I go to In and Out I order my double burger with no cheese.  It tastes so good it doesn't need the cheese.  But I do recommend the grilled onions.  That is the way to go... grilled onions.  Does Burger King offer grilled onions?  I seriously doubt it.  Would you want to eat grilled onions from Burger King?  Think about your response carefully before answering.  The fries are sliced right there from a real potato.  A REAL POTATO.  Like the brown thing that you see at the grocery store.  When I see a McDonalds or Jack in the Box truck driving around town I imagine inside that truck is a lot of frozen food.  I gotta figure that the fries are frozen in a bag.  But at In and Out Burger; I can see the guy slicing up the REAL POTATOES.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,This In-N-Out is set up just like every other In-N-Out. Walk in and there are you face the counter topped with three cash registered. As you walk forward; the restrooms will be on your right (with the men's on the left and women's on the right should you turn into the alcove) and the seating area will be the entire left of the store. You order; making sure to get a Neapolitan shake with your Double-Double and head to your left to fill up the ketchup tubs (no pickled peppers because this isn't California) before taking a seat on the benches which will be just in front of you. Don't worry about the soda fountain; which will be to your left; along the wall that's adjacent to the drive-thru; as you have a milk shake coming. When they call your order (Number 79; I believe); you go to the counter and find yourself a seat...but you can't have both a window and a booth. Should you want a window seat; you'll have to choose from the hard seats that are set up as two-seater tables; some which are bundled with others. You could eat outside; but this is Arizona; so I wouldn't recommend that. Upon finishing your burger; you should toss the garbage either by the secondary entrance or by the ketchup dispenser.  That is the restaurant layout and your experience; neither of which ever changes.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I like this place for a cheap meal but the food is always fresh. The burgers are always juicy and fresh but thin. That's okay cause they are so good. The fries are so good and freshly cut.  Service is always fast and friendly. Good burger place that we will always come visit.,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I travel to Scottsdale once or twice a year; and whenever I'm there; a burger (or two) at In-N-Out is a MUST!  In the car ride over I can honestly feel the butterflies in my stomach. A nervous-excitedness comes over me like I'm seeing my boyfriend for the first time after a long vacation or something. Will the burger still have the same greasy burger perfected deliciousness with just the right amount of sauce; lettuce; tomato; cheese and buttery toasted bun? Yes and yes.  (insert When Harry Met Sally scene...you know the one)  Shame on me for being an out-of-towner though; as I have just discovered their 'secret menu'! Animal style; protein style - don't know what that means? Just order it anyways because it's going to be amazing! OH and they have 7-UP as a fountain soda choice! Where else is that possible?!  In-N-Out always manages to knock my socks off. Everything is fresh; and the service surpasses that of fast food.  They have perfected the classic burger and fries combo.   So...when's the next flight out?,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I travel to Scottsdale once or twice a year; and whenever I'm there; a burger (or two) at In-N-Out is a MUST!  In the car ride over I can honestly feel the butterflies in my stomach. A nervous-excitedness comes over me like I'm seeing my boyfriend for the first time after a long vacation or something. Will the burger still have the same greasy burger perfected deliciousness with just the right amount of sauce; lettuce; tomato; cheese and buttery toasted bun? Yes and yes.

So...when's the next flight out?,1
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Late night munchies after watching the Tony Awards.  Had a hard time understanding the girl's voice on the speaker box; and finally realized after getting our order that she had asked us if we were eating in our car; when I thought she had asked if we were using a card.  I had the double cheese burger with onions and the chocolate milk shake.  My wife had the cheeseburger all the way and fries.  Asked the girl at the window for catsup; mustard and mayo; and she said they did not have mayo but she would give us catsup and mustard.  Got the tray (reason for the question about the car?) and realized after pulling off that she had not given us the catsup and mustard; so we stopped at a convenience store and got mayo and mustard (they didn't have catsup) and paid more for that than the burgers.  Burgers; fries and shake were tasty but we both were surprised after our first visit to an IAO that the menu was so limited.  However; hunger satisfied and now we know.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Great french fries; you can taste the freshness. The burger was really good; I think the bun was toasted. Next time i'll order the double cheeseburger. The regular patty was a little skimpy but still good.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I ordered the double on my last visit and OMG; seriously; OMG! I can't wait to go back.,0
g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,In-N-Out is predictable. If that is the only thing a chain would be graded on then every location I have been to would be a 5. Every food item is always fresh but I think a bit short on flavor. The portions are not over kill nor is the price. It will always take longer than average for a burger place to get your order. My visit here was based on predictable being what I was in the mood for that day.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Tonight I spent $9.28  for a burger; shake; and fries.  The service couldn't have been better.  Really nice people there and it was fast.  The restaurant was really clean; a plus with me.  The custard kind of shake was pretty good- haven't had one of that kind for awhile.  To be honest for what I paid; the burger really wasn't anything exceptional.  This surprised me as I seem to remember them being better.  Wonder what's happened there or if it was just me.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,It tastes just like home (Wisconsin)!   Butter burgers; custard; cheese curds and Walleye fish dinners ... ding; ding; ding; ding!  All in a fast food restaurant that can't be beat IMHO (narrowly beating on In & Out Burger).  Some complained about the service but I've had nothing but TOP NOTCH service here. The last time I was here a girl came around offering free custard samples and another staffer came around asking if everything was okay (try to get that service in any other fast food restaurant!).  And full disclosure ... I'm from Wisconsin which is where this franchise orginated so I maybe a little biased ...,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I rarely ever eat fast food; but then sometimes get a craving and am pleased to find something a little more like real food than the typical Burger King/McDonald's variety.  Along comes Culver's; the perfect place to roll through the drive through for an instant reward to my junk food craving of the moment.  Thinking that I'd probably have to settle on a greasy burger and fries if I didn't want a bland chicken sandwich and typical fast food salad; I was pleased to find pork tenderloin sandwiches on the menu (the other white meat that you can dunk in grease and fry) along with a range of sides.  My wife grabbed a frozen custard; I got the pork tenderloin with cole slaw; and  we both went away happy with our classic fast food selections.  Don't get me wrong; this place is nothing that I'd rave endlessly about; but it does fill a huge void in its segment and I'd argue it's probably far superior to places like In N Out; with its slightly broader (yet not overwhelming) selection and what appeared from the car to be a much more thoughtful seating layout.  Not only that; but I don't think you need to believe in Jesus to order the fries here (no bible verses on the packaging).  A little religion doesn't hurt while clogging your arteries; but Culver's was homey and family style without appearing to take sides on such a big non-fast food related issue as religion.  I'm a believer.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Culvers has the best burgers out of any fast food chain in the valley. Love their fried chicken too. mmmm!  A+ service everytime.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Culver's doesn't serve California; & I'd never heard of them before I moved over here & began driving past their various locations around the Valley.  I had supposed that this was a coffee shop; such as Denny's; and it was just never the right time to stop in; for four years; until today.  Wow; what a surprise!  It's a fast food place; and so nice inside!  SO; I ordered a Deluxe Double Burger Value Basket for this first visit; with a side salad (available at no extra charge as a substute for french fries); and an upgrade to a medium Chocolate Malt rather than a soda.  YAY MALTS!  The service was super friendly; the nice booth seating was completely comfortable (YAY BOOTHS!) and every bit of this lunch was delicious!  The malt was thick & tasty; the salad was good sized and included such treats as cherry tomatoes (and no extra charge for an extra dressing packet); and the 2-patty burger was big & delicious.  SO; Culver's here comes out of nowhere to drop in right as a burger chain I'm a fan of.  Yes; they have things other than burgers; & now I can't wait to return & start biting my way through most everything on the menu.     :-))  Deluxe Double Burger; Side Salad; Medium (16 oz.) Chocolate Malt:  $8.69,1

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I love Culver's.  Their burgers are among my favorite; the cheese curds are delicious; and their peanut butter Concrete Mixer is sinful.  Unfortunately; service at this location is exceptionally lacking.  I placed a drive-thru order for the food items mentioned above last week during the lunch hour.  I was asked to pull forward to wait for my meal; and I waited... and waited... and waited.  I waited for a full 20 minutes before my meal was brought out to me; only to find it was incorrect.  The server who brought the food out to me stared at me like he didn't know what I was saying and then told me I was mistaken.  When he saw I was; indeed; correct; he took my food bank in and I waited another five minutes for my meal.  At that point; already late getting back to work; I left.  Imagine my dismay when I got back to my desk and discovered my meal was wrong yet again.  It was my fault for not checking once again before leaving; I know; but seriously?  I'll stick with the Metrocenter location despite it being a few miles out of my way.,0

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,"I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit; met a chick; she took a credit card in her name; he didn't pay her back; she's shocked; now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said \what planet are you from?\""...Dude with mullet bows his head; darts his eyes from JJ and says \""Why; I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy\"".  LMAO!  Culver's; by way of the Dairy State; has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our \""date night\"". Thought it was a cute; innocent; 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know; kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please; I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!  Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick; icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd; fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.  Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?  We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds.   I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff.""",1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I'm not much of a fast food person; but I keep hearing good things about this place; so I decided today to give it a try. I ordered the butter burger; and some cheese curd things.. I'm not sure of the name because i ordered to go in a hurry. The burger was pretty good; the beef actually taste a little like beef; I was shocked.. It was actually pretty good. I'll probably come here again when I crave for another burger.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I would give 4 stars for the food and 2 for the service. That should balance out to a 3; but I am disappointed enough right now to not feel generous at the moment.  Everything I've eaten here on multiple visits has been delicious: Rich; real flavors. None of the acidic aftertaste of McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's. The ice cream is reason enough to go in and of itself. Everything on the menu works as comfort food.  And I've enjoyed it all; once I have gone through the labors of Hercules to finally get what I ordered.  Today in the drive-thru they managed to ask my drink order on 5 different occasions; and still got it wrong. Medium Diet Pepsi and a small Sierra Mist. It's almost a mantra for me now. I was given fries after twice specifying onion rings. My kid wanted ketchup for his chicken tenders and got nothing instead. And there were no napkins in the bags.   At other times they have omitted parts of orders placed inside; or sent me something that had nothing to do with what I had ordered. The help has noted the mistakes by nodding in some sort of brain-dead daze and wandering off in the distance.  I guess it must be rocket science.   So if you have time and stress to burn; go to Culvers and be rewarded with some really good flavors.,0

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,So this could be a 4.5 star rating IF the staff would not have been eating a dominos pizza  in front of us that some random girl from dominos brought in on her bike... Then when we asked if the custards sitting on a tray off to the back were ours (one girl munching on pizza next to them); the next girl brought them to us and said they were just finished... Not pleased at all with the service. Btw the custard was yummy. Not sure if I will return.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,"This Culver's location just opened up in my neighborhood so I ventured in.  The entire staff was working.  They were completely over staffed.  I guess it is better to be safe than sorry for a grand opening.  There was not a line so I walked right up to the cashier and ordered a Deluxe Double Burger.  I was up sold from fries to cheese curds.  I asked the cashier were this business started and she told me Wisconsin.  She tried to sell me custard too.  I said no.  I took my number; went to the soda fountain and filled my cup with Culver's own Root Beer.  I sat down and waited for my burger and cheese curds.  Of course the place was clean; it is brand new.  (Lets see if it stays that way)  They have a large flat screen that was playing sports.  The walls had Biblical quotes from Proverbs.  Am I in the banquet hall from the church next door?  I quickly looked under my cup to see if there were anymore quotes.  No quotes.  It did have a question though.  \What flavor are you?\""  Gee!! I don't know; Spicy Mexican maybe.  My burger came and it was wet with oil or butter or water.  It was juicy.  Not a bad burger but not great.  The cheese curds were nice.  I like cheese; and the fact that it is battered and deep fried is all the more sinful.  My arteries were screaming at me and saying \""why are you eating this?\""  I enjoyed the Root Beer.  I went for a refill on my way out.  The total for my meal was $7.79.  I will go back to Culver's but not often.  My craving for cheese curd will have to kick in for me to go back.  A-OK.""",0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Yummy is all I can say.  My partner is from Milwaukee; Wisconsin so she was in heaven when we were on vacation in Phx and we found a culver's.  She always prefers Leon's; but this is a close second.  The store is clean; everyone is friendly and the service is good.  They will give you a sample of any flavor to try before buying.  My only complaint is they dont have coke products; just pepsi.  Ick.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,5 star fast food! Wow!  Hubby and I were in town for the Fiesta Bowl and needed to grab a little lunch before heading to the game. I checked yelp for close burger places and thought this one sounded good. Oh yes. It was.   Not only were are burgers juicy and tasty; the cheese curds and the mashed potatoes and gravy (oh how I loved the gravy!) were also really good! And the service? Exceptional! I know I'm jaded because I live in the land of mediocre service; but this must have been the best; kindest service I've received in who knows how long. Even if the food was just ok; (and if I lived in AZ) I would come back just to say hi. These girls deserve a raise!,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Ugh; these places are terrible.  I'm not really sure why the husband and I decided to give them another shot; maybe because they're in a nicer part of town or maybe we were just being nice; who knows.    We decided to go inside the restaurant this time to see what they were all about and it's just a little overwhelming and quite a bit claustrophobic.  There is so much going on in here; with a huge backlit menu above the registers; a good number of TV's blasting some basketball game; and the cacophony going on in the kitchen.  After about 10 minutes of trying to figure the menu out; we decide to order and then wait about another 10 minutes while the guy pushing the buttons figured out how to do a stupid cheeseburger with just mayo and ketchup.  We waited a little while for our food to come out and the same look of disappointment from my last experience spread across my face when I saw my burger.  I got an ill formed patty with ridiculously cripsy edges and haphazard construction.  I ate it and it really sucked.  At least I didn't get sick this time.  The only good things about this place are their fried cheese curds and some promising concrete flavors.  Aside from those two things; I will never eat anything else from here again.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Fast food burgers aren't exactly known for their healthiness; but the burger I had here had to be the greasiest mess I've ever had. I ordered the sourdough melt; which I admit may be buttered a bit more than the normal burger. But I felt like I needed a shower after eating this. Decent flavor; but not good enough to warrant trying again.  Not a fan of the fries - I appreciate the fact that they do the crinkle-cut fries; to do something a bit different - but this just didn't work for me.  I've had the custard; and that was pretty good; probably qualifies as an alternative to DQ or BR if I'm in the mood for a quick frozen fix. But I don't think I'd be back for the burgers.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,"Decided to try this custard out. LIttle did I know it was the wrong day OR their service is just this bad. I NEVER GOT MY ORDER! Ordered a shake and waited and waited and waited. People with shake orders came and went. Hanging near the counter; the employee asked \are you still waiting?\"". Finally gave up and left. They took my money but never got my food.""",0

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I've gone to Culver's twice on my lunch hour since writing my last review.   I have to say my second and third experience was not as good as the first. While the food is still easily the best chain fast food out there; the service leaves much to be desired.   Both times I sat waiting 40 minutes for my food while confused staff members walked around aimlessly with people's orders trying to figure out what belonged with who.   Unlike the other Culver's locations I have been to; the staff at this location are not very friendly. They act overly friendly as if they have been told it is part of their job. But it comes off as insincere and even a bit patronizing. (Is there anything worse than being patronized by a snot-nosed teenage fast food worker?)  If you want to try out a Culver's; I recommend avoiding this one and going to the one on Peoria or  the one on Deer Valley.,0

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,"After my trip here last week was thwarted by lunch crowds and no available parking; I returned today; mid-afternoon; and breezed right in. I really like; and have been patronizing; In-N-Out for my beef and cheese fix due to their proximity to home. However; since Culver's not only offers clearly better burgers at a nearly identical price point (yes; you had me at \butter\""); but also the many delights and myriad dairy based dessert wonders that evolve from frozen custard; my heart's preference just has to be Culvers.

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Got to give them four stars;  Above the crowed; cooked to order food here is simply great. Yes butter burger is a fun time but the real mean is their entrees   Fried Chicken and Fried Cod; they keep their fries clean and use a great breading recipe;  try it you'll be back for more.  The beef is ok; sometimes a little salty.    mixers; not the biggest fan but they hit the spot when you need to.  be creative and make your own mixer.    Service; well its ok; they do bring it to your table and when you do a drive thru don't expect this to be Wendy's; it will take some time depending on what you order.  Your given a number and a nice high school student will bring some food to you. The service seems to be young here; they just like hiring someone looking for their 1st job or so.  No this does not create the best service but creates; our local future.  giving a younger kid a job is not easy to do and these kids will move onto another job and keep working this is good karma for Culver's Phoenix  and shows an investment in the town.    I choose to review this location because it has been around.  I used to go out of my way to find a Culver's.  now they are popping up around town.  As a Midwest person this is great to see.  This is mid west food; comforting a little greasy but dedicated to a great meal.    kevin,0

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Excellent all the way around! Very clean; great menu; great frozen custard; friendly service; reasonable prices....I'll never go to Micky D's again.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I'm from Wisconsin so Culver's is a little piece of home to me.  Midwest meats make the patties for the delicious butter burgers... yes; butter makes those burgers SOOO delicious. The dairy to make the custard is from wisconsin; the cheese curds to make the fried cheese curds are from wisconsin... it's too good!  There's always vanilla custard; chocolate custard and flavor of the day.  And when I say custard I don't mean ice cream or anything like it... it's FAR better; creamier and more flavorful!  Check their website or drive by to see what the flavor of the day is.  Also; join their email list and get amazing coupons!!  LOVE the food. The service is great. The prices are amazing.  AND ITS ALL FROM WISCONSIN!!,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,This place was clean and the service was top notch! It is a cross between a Dairy Queen and a Carl's Jr. If you are hungry - get your hamburger with 2 patties - they are kinda slim. The fries were great and they have a ton of frozen custard desserts.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Butter + Burger = The best thing I've put in my mouth in a long while.  I didn't know anything about Culver's until a co-worker told me about their ButterBurgers. She didn't have to explain. I was sold.   I decided to come here for lunch and it was BUSY but you know what; we didn't have a issue finding parking and the service was fast. I got a Cheese ButterBurger Basket (comes with fries and a drink) for $6. You do have to specify what you want with your burger; so I had to stop and think about it since most burger joints just put everything in it.  My food came and gone in a New York minute. I was hungry! But It also helped that the food was fresh and delicious. The burger meat was thinner than others and looks hand-pressed; not frozen patties. Reminds me of In N Out or that nice backyard bbq burger. The crinkle fries are nothing extraordinary but at least they weren't bad.   Since I finished my food so fast; I had to try their frozen custard. After minutes of wavering and fickleness; I settled with the double scoop Turtle ($4). The cup was handed to me and and I could feel the warm caramel. I couldn't wait to dig in.. and I didn't. We took the frozen custard to-go but I finished half of it before making it to the car. The custard was thick; creamy and the walnuts were perfectly roasted. I saved the cherry for last.   Oh yeah- We were given calendars while we waited in line and they come pre-loaded with coupons for each month. As if I needed anymore enticement.   I saw a lot of  things on the menu that I wanted to try; like their dinners (prime rib sandwiches; fried chicken and green beans). I'll have to start at a 3-star and let the other menu items earn the others.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,My first experience with Culver's was absolutely fantastic.  The food was very tasty and the atmosphere was friendly.  The girl (sad to say I forgot her name) demonstrated one of the best customer service experiences I had every had.  I wished I was fortunate to have hired her.  Culver's keep up the great work and give the Culver's Crew a raise for a job well done.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,If you are from the Midwest...then this place is a little piece of home. The food is great and the service is impeccable. I have a Culver's in my hometown of Marquette; Michigan but can honestly say that I have never ever been there; due to the fact they came to town after I moved to AZ...but all my friends back home swear by it and as soon as this place opened up; my buddy here from Chicago swore by it up and down; he said that he was really happy that one opened up so close to him because he normally drives to the one location in Mesa at least once a month to get his fix so with all this raving I had to go try it out.   I got the Mushroom n Swiss single with cheddar cheese fries and a strawberry smoothie...REAL CHEESE...OMG REAL CHEESE...amazing. To say the least the burger was good; the cheese chili fires are a heart attack in a tray and the smoothie was outstanding.  I will say this about Culver's even though I enjoyed it thoroughly if you are on a diet this is not the place for you; almost everything on their menu has upwards of 600 calories or more...in fact I saw some things like their 4 piece fried chicken has over 2000 calories. So not a great place for dieters...it doesn't help either that they sell pints and quarts of their ice cream to go....by the way which is also delicious.   What I felt was nice about this location is that you can sit inside and they open up the front of the store with these huge bay doors to out door seating which allowed for a cool night breeze to come in and you feel like you sitting outdoors indoors. Great big TV's with sports on...and a ton of staff to basically take care of your every need while you eat.  Culver's is definitely worth the visit. The food is great and the service is untouchable for a fast food place. If you have never been I highly suggest going at least once to check it out.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I give Culvers three stars because it was neat; clean and  the staff was friendly. However my order was wrong. I ordered a meatless salad but when it arrived; it had chicken. I must admit; the chicken was well-prepared and tasty.  However; I do think it was odd that they came out with the dessert about 10 minutes before the entrée. Regardless; the free Wi-Fi was appreciated!,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Loved it! Here's what I had:  Culver's Butterburger Deluxe Double Basket (the burger; med fries; med drink); and a Mint Oreo Concrete Mixer.  The whole experience was awesome! The employees were very patient as this was my second time at Culver's (my first time was a few months ago) and was using coupons. The meal was ready before I was done filing up my drink. Quick service! I chose to get the mixer after the meal and that also came quick. It came to just under $20.  Clean store; quick service; superb customer service; awesome food; hot meal; delicious dessert; what more could anyone ask for?,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,years ago; we couldn't find a frozen custard shop in phoenix without taking a tremendous; all-day affair journey to the far east....valley. now they seem to be all over the place.   culvers is cute...reminds me of dairy queen back when ice cream was cool to eat. i did have a little trouble trying to figure out how to order. there's all kinds of funky flavors and add-on's that a slow southerner like me has to process before ordering. luckily the counter girl explained how it worked and we were set.   the wife had the mint chocolate chip; and although i've never been a fan of that flavor; i actually liked the custard version. i picked the vanilla with p-butter and banana and it was freaking delicious! very rich and creamy; and even a small was too much for me...you know; trying to watch my awesome figure. we paid about 7 bucks for 2 smalls.   after you order; you have a seat and they bring it to you. apparently you can get burgers there as well (DQ all over again).   summer is always a great time for a cool treat and since it's nearly summer all year long in phoenix; it's always cool treat time. thanks to culvers for keeping us satisfied.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,This was my first trip to Culver's and it came highly recommended. At my friends suggestion; I tried the butter burger deluxe; fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called; but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard. The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double); the lettuce was crisp; tomatoes fresh; bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful! I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape; and full of salty cheesy goodness. The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces; but there was a mixup; but I had no complaints). I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I can't wait to go next time so I can try something new.  The thing I didn't like was the bible verses all over the walls. Seriously?? It's not that I am anti-religion or anything. I am Catholic; went to Brophy and go to church twice a year. I don't need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends. take a tip from In and Out. Put them on the under side of your cups. Work on your subtlety Culver's.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,We're on a low carb diet and they were able to accommodate that. Then when my boyfriend dropped his burger out of its lettuce wrap they replaced it for free. I always loved their food; now I have to praise their service too!,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,"I love Culver's.  I grew up in Wisconsin so Culver's is in my blood.  Before we moved here I had to visit my parents or my in laws to satisfy a Culver's craving; now they're all over the valley and we live in Phoenix now!  This Culver's had a rough start.  We came with friends in December and it was SLOW.  30 minute wait at least for our food.  February was a different story and everything arrived much more quickly.  My only recent complaint was that I ordered the flavor of the day custard \chocolate oreo volcano\"" (a family favorite).  And what it seems I actually received was 'oreo overload'.  I would double check on some of the servers' knowledge of what the flavor of the day ingredients are.  Other than that; a solid location; now that they've got their feet under them.""",0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I have family members who love this place!  We met up today and I can see why.  I don't eat fast food as a rule but ended up having a grilled cheese; side salad; and strawberry shake. My family had fried chicken and burgers; along with frozen custatds.  This place is definitely a few steps above Mickey D's; etc.  The service is good; as are the prices.  I do appreciate the pricing and opportunity to order a children's meal.  For my fast-food loving friends; it's a thumbs up.,1

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Blech. I was running an errand during lunchtime and decided to run through their drive through to pick up a quick bite to eat - I had heard that the food was good from friends. Uncharacteristically; I ordered the chicken strips; fries and an iced tea. The chicken; while crispy; had no flavor in the breading except for an overwhelming amount of salt. The chicken was juicy with a chemically tinged juice. And worst of all; they were cold in the middle. I ate one bite; took a second and literally had to spit it out. Disgusting.  The fries were oversalted and greasy. Nice crunch though. Finished maybe 1/4 of them before I just couldn't eat anymore.   Iced tea was good; but all of the ice was melted by the time I had taken 2 sips. Note to staff - real brewed iced tea is awesome; but it is warm; so you need to fill the cup ALL the way with ice.   Never again. Ick ick ick.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,4 Stars for the food and the company caring about quality more than other places.  -1 Star for them allowing a homeless guy to pester me and most likely others at a place where I am forced to park and wait for my food and I can't leave if I want my money's worth. They are also lucky I don't -1 more Star for the girl working there at the moment I am writing this review. She was very short and rude and annoying. She was literally mad at me from the minute I drove up to the speaker because I wanted to take a moment to look at the menu which I am still not familiar with (and ask my wife on the phone what we should get). Then she was even more mad at me for asking for honey mustard at the window. I felt very happy to hand over $20 (which I never spend on restaurants anywhere) to receive this treatment from a place that is trying to be more dignified fast food. I expect this treatment at a lame joint; but this is supposed to be Culver's.  Also; I don't care for the chocolate custard/ice cream whatever they call it. It tastes like Wendy's frosty. That's lame.  Other than that it is a place with decent burgers and the toppings/mix-ins cover up the cheap ice cream well enough to get it more than once.  ***UPDATE***  -3 Stars for food poisoning to top off the experience. I regret going; and wish I had ordered pizza (which is saying something).,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,The customer service is usually as awesome as their custard.  I always get the custard with strawberries and cheesecake.  Awesome!,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Sara B. wrote exactly what I was thinking.  I'm a big fan of Culvers.  This place puts every day fast food to shame.  Their food isn't sitting there waiting for someone to order it.  It's fresh and made to order.  They have a huge menu of options at good prices and you get quality service with a smile.,0

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I once had a friend who dreamt of cheeseburgers. In fact; she described that in her dream she was standing in front of a hotel made out of a cheesburger! Drippy cheesy goodness made up the swaying curtains that pulled away from the windows. Each condiment represented a different floor of the building--and that it smelled like the bestest cheeseburger ever!   The day I ate a Culvers Double Butter Burger with Bacon; I knew exactly what she was saying! Buttery Delicious Goodness are the words that come to mind! And... after surviving on a 500 cal/day diet for 3 weeks I even admit to having dreamt of a cheeseburger to this caliber!   The custard is fab--the customer service is the best you'll see at a fast food place--its your down-home kinda joint--for every family to enjoy! Go in deep---and you'll come out smiling everytime at Culvers!!! :-),0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I am a fan of Culvers; but this location is not as awesome as the ones in Minneapolis and Wisconsin.  However; good service nonetheless; excellent burgers and mmm Culvers frozen custard.  It just can't be beat.,1
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,This place on two separate visits; months apart; had forgotten my order and somehow lost it after waiting over 20 to 25 minutes each time. Employees rather text on their phones and lean against counters rather than serve their customers.  Culver's has awesome frozen custard with creative flavors of the day. This location also is very clean and well maintained especially the bathrooms which are a plus. You just have to make sure to check in with the front every 5 minutes if you don't want them to forget your order.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Was that a burger? I was so turned off by the charred greasy whatever that was on my bun;I couldn't take a Second bite or even make myself eat the fries or order any custard. So based on the one bite I could stomach less than 1star.,0
ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,If they had a Culver's on every street corner; the cardiologists would all have twice as much money. I went there for my first time today for lunch; and I was hoping for a good; non-processed burger. I got my wish; a soft bun; red onions; lettuce; fresh tomatoes... all the fixings were great. The cheese was very good; and the beef patties were also good. (I got the deluxe). Since I never had fried cheese curds; I got those as my side item.  It was very reasonably priced; $8 or so for the combo with a root beer. Service was fast; food was fresh and hot. But here's the kicker.... I looked up the nutrional information after lunch; when I felt like I couldn't get out of my office chair. This combo had 84g of fat and 3000mg of sodium.  Even if you don't watch what you eat; these numbers should scare the hell out of you. To put it into perspective; my diet calls for 1500mg sodium DAILY.  I could've gone to In-N-Out; gotten an animal style double-double with fries and saved 15 grams of fat and saved 1300mg sodium. I could've ordered 2 quarter pounders with cheese and 2 large fries and still eaten fewer grams of fat and sodium. Now do you see exactly how bad these burgers are for you?!? Imagine if I had gotten the bacon cheeseburger with a custard for dessert. That'd be another 30 grams of fat. We're talking triple digits here. Scary stuff. Now; I like to splurge on occasion for great food. Unfortunately; for that caloric catastrophe; it simply wasn't worth it. It's a good burger; definitely better than the typical fast food; but come on. These numbers are beyond reasonable.  To be fair; the fried cheese curds constituted 38g of fat alone. Now that I've had them for the first time in my life; I'll say I enjoyed them. They're almost as good as fried mozzarella; but I still prefer the Italian version over the Wisconsin one. So if you want to splurge; enjoy the custard. I've had it once before here; and it's excellent; especially the vanilla. But if you want to blow your diet; even though the food is decent here; do it somewhere else.,1

ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,"If Culver's were on every other block; like some of the \other\"" fast food burger places; those \""other\"" places wouldn't be in business.   Culvers has fresh made-to-order burgers and sandwiches which are very tasty; made with fresh ingredients and very affordable! Plus; the burgers taste delish! They remind me of burgers from my childhood; but I can't put my finger on where. Suffice it to say; they're really; really; good.   Their french fries are always hot and yummy; and although I haven't tasted their ice cream; it looks fab!  The personel are always cheerful and friendly; and they bring you your food minutes after ordering...to your table!   Trust me; skip Mickey D's and Burger Queen and go to Culvers!""",1
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,When I am at home living the high life in Queen Creek; this is my closest Chipotle. I do tend to prefer it to the Costa Vida across the street; although some times the lines can be long. A big ole' burrito is always good; but typically I go with the chicken bowl. Two chicken bowls and a side of chips & quac will run about $16; but it is good for what is somewhat fast  food.   This location always has good service. I visited last night and asked the guy for some of the fajita vegetables - no problem. I ordered the chicken bowl and he said they barely had enough for one serving; so if I wanted he would give me half chicken and have steak.  Which leads to why this is 4 stars and not 5 - apparently chicken is the big seller; so why would you run out? I have to admit since I received the last of the chicken I wasn't really as concerned as the lady behind me who was told it would be a six and a half minute wait while the guy finished grilling the chicken. Maybe its just me; but if you know folks like to eat chicken; is it that difficult to look in the bucket; see it getting low and think maybe you need to throw some yard birds on the fire?   Maybe a little operations management/inventory control is needed - but the food and service receives high marks!,1

fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,"Finally; the infamous Chipotle.  No matter what food destiny could await me; my mind will forever be \stained\"" with the memory of the hilarious South Park \""Chipotle-Away\"" infomercial; with Billy Mays hawking a laundry spray to take away Chipotle-related skidmarks...  For those wondering why I would still try it: I actually heard numerous raves from a buddy who used to eat at one in Colorado Springs.  He still insists on pronouncing it \""Chi-Pole-Tay.\""  I told him that it's the same as a chipotle pepper--he comes back saying the pepper is \""Chi-Pote-Lay\"" but the resto says it \""Chi-Pole-Tay.\""  Sorry; but South Park says otherwise.  Anyway; the Chipotle chain seems to be thriving; converting a lot of people.  I wonder if those people ever eat at real Mexican places.  If you don't have real Mexican food available; you might be impressed on what Chipotle offers.  I'd give this location 2 1/2 stars.  The menu is pretty limited: soft or crispy tacos; burritos/fajita burritos; \""burrito bowls;\"" salads; and chips w/guac.  You can choose from about 6-7 kinds of meat (or veg options) depending on what you order.  I didn't want fajitas or just veg.; so I had to decide between grilled carne asada; grilled chicken; barbacoa (shredded beef); or carnitas (shredded pork).    When we first walked in; we were told there was no rice ready; and there would be about 1/2 hr. wait if we wanted rice.  A girl ahead of us in line walked out.  Not being from the area; we didn't want to go back into the heat and drive; so we decided to kick it.  Fortunately for us (sorry rice girl!) we were then told that it would only be a couple of minutes; and to go ahead and order.  I checked out the meats in the metal serving bins; they looked like they had been sitting for about an hour...shredded meat looked totally dried out --I opted for the grilled beef which didn't look as bad.  What looked really good was the guacamole--freshly pounded and still chunky with avocado.  The guac was $1.40 extra; but it looked good enough to be worth it; and what better way to moisten a potentially dry burrito.  I'm leery of any sour cream that sits out; so I opted for cheese instead; rice; lettuce; hot sauce; and black beans (pinto being the other option).  The rice is a white cilantro-lime rice.  You can also get corn; which I'm about as likely to add to a burrito as an Oldsmobile.  Luckily for me; the kid @ the register didn't charge me for the guacamole addition (he saw me flinch a little when told about the extra charge); so I got the deal.  That move earned your business an extra 1/2 star kid; pushing this review into the 3-star (therefore acceptable) zone.  Way to go!  Since the company might not appreciate your giving that stuff away for free; I'll neglect to thank you by name; so you can keep your job n' all.  Also; Coke Zero was available as a fountain drink; which was a happy surprise to me.  The burrito was pretty average in both size and quality.  The guacamole was really tasty; but none of the other ingredients; including the meat or salsa; stood out flavor wise.  The gringo-fied rice and relative blandness of it gave it more of a \""wrap\"" taste than the more authentic burritos I'm used to.  Not bad; just kind of blah.  A decent; inoffensive meal; no more; no less.  I've had worse.       I accept the concept of Americanized; or; as Chipotle calls it; \""gourmet\"" Mexican food.  In the Santa Barbara area; despite having a few authentic places; 15-20 years ago (when I lived there) one of my favorite Mexican places was very \""California healthy Mex;\"" i.e.; quite inauthentic.  If the quality and value is there; why not.  But I wouldn't say the quality of Chipotle is anything approaching \""gourmet.\""  Plus the price--if the kid had charged me for the guacamole; that would have been an $8 burrito.  If you're gonna charge that much; kick up the portion size.  I've paid $4.50-$6.50 for HUGE burritos many times; what I like to call \""bricks o' food\"" that could easily provide two meals.  That's including avocado or guacamole.  I don't mind paying a little more; but at least make it worth my while..  The guacamole stood out; other than that; meh!!  For what it's worth; Chipotle does seem to have a commitment to organic and healthy ingredients.  And; I'm happy to say; I did avoid the fate that South Park was warning me about.  I guess with that; the convenience; and the generosity of the worker; this \""Chi-Pole-Tay\"" gets a passing grade...but not much else.""",0
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,"Let me start by saying I love Chipotle. With that being said I was let down today. There were lots of staff who were 10 times louder than all the customers. You could hear every personal conversation they were having including ones about other staff with \buggers\"" on them and many colorful curse words (with kids in the restaurant). The manager was included with the staff and seemed ok or oblivious to the conversations of the staff. The food was ok but the service was horrible.   Staff was noisy; crude and gave the feeling you were a bother by being here. All I thought about my entire meal was is where the buggers are were or will be. I finally gave up threw my food away and left.""",0
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,Not much needs to be said about Chipotle's food in general... if you've never been to one; I suggest going immediately; like; right now; or you might as well jump off a cliff because life is just not worth living (jk; don't really do that).  Chipotle's food is delish; consistent; healthy; fast; fresh; environmentally conscious; and well priced.  What more can you ask for?  If this will be your first Chipotle experience; get a chicken burrito (currently $6.25); with a side of chips and guac ($2.95)... you can't go wrong!  Regarding this specific Queen Creek location; I am a frequent.  95% of the time; I submit my order via the Chipotle app in the Apple Appstore.  Very easy and fun to order this way.  I almost always get the chicken (occasionally the carnitas); because I've found that the other meats (steak; shredded beef) are just not that great... the steak is a bit chewy for my taste.  Anyway; the orders are usually complete within 5 minutes of the pickup time confirmation; but it is not unusual for me to show up a few minutes after the pickup time and they haven't even started it yet.  They are usually very kind and accommodating about it; and may even offer free drinks or chips for the inconvenience... and once; they even paid for the meal followed up by one of the employees calling my phone to apologize and ask about the problem.  They do seem to have a pretty decently high turnover of the staff.  Not sure what to make of that; but it does cause some hiccups in the service (including running out of guacamole once; which was very depressing... because it's sooo good; and I can barely live without it) as they are training the new employees.  But in all the turnover; I have only come in contact with one employee who should not have been working there; and he doesn't anymore; thankfully.  All in all; even though this is not the best Chipotle location; it has top quality Chipotle food; friendly employees; and a pleasant atmosphere.,0

Anyway; the orders are usually complete within 5 minutes of the pickup time confirmation; but it is not unusual for me to show up a few minutes after the pickup time and they haven't even started it yet.  They are usually very kind and accommodating about it; and may even offer free drinks or chips for the inconvenience... and once; they even paid for the meal followed up by one of the employees calling my phone to apologize and ask about the problem.  They do seem to have a pretty decently high turnover of the staff.  Not sure what to make of that; but it does cause some hiccups in the service (including running out of guacamole once; which was very depressing... because it's sooo good; and I can barely live without it) as they are training the new employees.  But in all the turnover; I have only come in contact with one employee who should not have been working there; and he doesn't anymore; thankfully.  All in all; even though this is not the best Chipotle location; it has top quality Chipotle food; friendly employees; and a pleasant atmosphere.,0
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,Yet another fine meal from Chipotle; I am now convinced that this cannot be called Fast Food. It's just Far To Good to be categorized with Mac Donalds or Taco Bell The grilled chicken burrito is always great and is HUGE!  It's always two meals worth of food.  Service is always quick so we are always in & out Lickety Split! What more can you ask?,1
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,Had the Burrito Bowl; delicious. They have staffed up the place for quicker lines and even better customer service. Very healthy as the food is not fried. I recommend if you like fresh Mexican food.,1
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,This was the first Chipotle I've been to that the service was subpar. This seems consistent with other reviewers. We phoned in our order for pickup and my wife had to call back twice because no one picked up. When someone did; my wife barely could hear the person on the other line--lots of commotion and shouting.   When I went to pick up the order; it was definite chaos in the kitchen. Very noisy. Never been to a Chipotle so loud before. I went to the register; gave them my name and told me what was in the bag. Got home; and was missing one of two kids meals.  Called back--still hard to hear--and they offered to replace the meal next time we are in. Not sure we will take them up on the offer; but it was a nice gesture. Food was delcious as always--can't fault them there.,0

fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,They just do not listen when you order; found myself having to repeat everything. Is it just me or are the people who work at Chipotle or Subway about the most miserable of any fast food? If you can get past the staff and their perma-frowns; the food is pretty decent.,0
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,By far the best #chipotle around. Decent portion food vs. the pinky portion other chipotle in the area offers. Good customer service; very friendly.,1
fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,This place sits right across the street from where I work and; at most; it's a five minute walk. While the place is usually busy during my lunch hour; that's to its credit because people want to eat there and they're willing to wait. I'm always willing to wait; but folks; they have an iPod/iPhone app and an order online feature that makes it so you don't have to wait. I frequently order my lunch hours before lunchtime. When I get there; it's in a sack with my name on it and I get to skip the line; pay; and eat.  Brilliant!  Also the staff here is easily the friendliest I've ever seen in a Chipotle. They know my name; even though I only go there once or twice a month; usually on a payday. I usually order my burrito with extra sour cream and they always happily oblige. The service is superb.  The place is kept very clean. Indeed; I've seen people come out from behind the counter to clean; wipe; and tidy when they have a brief lull.  In the end; I think it says something about the place when I will drive out of my way to go to this particular Chipotle than drive a shorter distance to a closer one.,1

rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,"I will not be returning to Federico's.  I've been ordering burritos from Federico's for some time now. I usually just go bean and cheese with some rice; guac and pico. Simple. Tasty.  Today I opted for the drive thru for the first time; and I took a moment to decide whether I wanted to switch it up with some chicken. I made my choice to add it to my burrito and proceeded to the window to pay for it; even giving a bigger than usual holiday tip. This was gonna be GREAT.  What happened next was heartbreaking and left me in shock and awe. On my way home; I steal a bite of my burrito and it's all chicken. None of my other burrito adornments are in sight as I peer through this salty mess of chicken. I give it a squeeze and all I feel is lumpy chicken for miles. Da hell? I decided to wait until I got home to investigate further.  My burrito was assembled as if it had purposefully been intended to be the worst burrito ever. 2/3 of one end was chicken and the last third was cheese; beans; a few grains of rice; pico; and maybe a DROP OR TWO OF GUAC. In that order; as if perfectly arranged one on top of the other to ensure minimal mixing of ingredients and a mouth full of unmelted cheese. I'm serious. I know it sounds crazy; but I don't joke about burritos.  I think it's reasonable to expect that anyone working at a mexican food establishment would be familiar with proper burrito assembly. Anyone who has even eaten a burrito could have done a better job assembling my burrito so as to properly disperse it's contents. With their eyes closed.  This; in my opinion; is inexcusable and honestly felt like a deliberate \F*** YOU.\"" This is not a risk I am willing to take again. I'll be sticking with Rolando's on 35th and Peoria.""",0
rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,I recommend this place due to the cheap combos; cleanliness; fast service; quality of food; and the wide variety of the food. I go all the time with my family and it's always just as great as the time before. It's rare to actually find real Mexican food but Federico's has it 24/7!!!,1
rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,How hard is it to take my order and give me what I ordered? The last three times have been progressively worse. Last time; order just nachos. Pico de Gillo; quac; and sour cream on the side. Get home; no PdG; no quac; no sour cream. Tonight; fish taco plate and nachos (same way as last). Nachos are fine; my fish taco plate magically turned into some sort of squashed enchilada thing in red sauce. HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP? I WAS THE ONLY CAR IN THE DRIVE THRU AND YOU REPEATED THE ORDER BACK TO ME. I'm miles away now and can't go back. If I ever do. The food is just OK. It will be a long while before I go back. Even the beans and rice where nearly flavorless.,0
rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,Great food; but my order gets messed almost every time up. Today; Arizona burrito was missing and 2 sides of guacamole MIA.... Last visit my French fries were MIA...... I wouldn't mind but it gets expensive ordering food you never get!!! Going to trying some other Mexican restaurants in the area because this is getting old!!!!!!!,0
rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,"As quick service Mexican food goes; Federico's hits the spot. What I find ironic is when this was a KFC; I would see cockroaches crawling all over the drive-through when I was nearby; and now that its a \hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint\"" its infinitely cleaner.   Late night drunken carne asada fries? Check!  Tasty adobada burrito? Check!   Rolled tacos smothered in guac and cheese? You know it!  Prices are reasonable; quality is consistent and good; and flavor is never lacking""",1
rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,Good food but they always fuk the orders up.,0
rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,If you are looking for fresh & delicious food look no further my friend. The service was fast and friendly and served with a smile. They even let me sample the horchata! The restaurant was clean and they are even open 24hr. I will be back!,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,This location is always clean and the staff is friendly. I visit here when the truck is being serviced next door. The same team always seem to be working the front as well. Pristine both for food and experience!,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Very good clean restaurant; great service and friendly staff. Food was great and very delicious;,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Yes; I'm reviewing @ChickfilA; but with good reason.  Marissa worked the counter today; and epitomized service with a smile!  She delivered our food to the table; and even asked if we needed refills on our drinks.  She was one of the friendliest people I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant; and should be praised by her employer.  The food is pretty good; and I would probably go to Chik fil-A before KFC.  But I just want to rave about the service.,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Love their chicken sandwiches and biscuits! Their lemonade is awesome; as well. The service at this location is always fast and friendly. The food is hot and fresh. I stop here pretty often for breakfast on my way to work. You can order a sandwich instead of a biscuit for breakfast; if you prefer! :),1

cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Love the food here; it's so fresh and made to order.  They don't leave any food on the hot plate or under the lights.  Love the waffle fries and their milkshakes.  All the employees that works there are very polite.  Just love it.,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,I didn't know they charged extra for lemonades; which was a down side.  But other than that; all food are still great; service still excellent.  Great jobs everyone!,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Love to come here for the fries and shakes! Delicious and quick; friendly service.,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Great customer service and high quality; delicious food every time. There was a line wrapped around the building and I waited no more than 3 minutes after ordering to get my food. They had a young man outside taking orders which made the ordering process smooth and very efficient. Good job Chik Fil A!,1

cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,"Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which; unfortunately; they sometimes skimp on; in my opinion.   I have to tell you; though; I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week; but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole \kids eat free\"" thing.) I was so mesmerized; as I waited in line to order and then for my food;  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And; their kids' meals have educational toys; often promoting literacy).""",0
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Compared to the one in Deer Valley where I work.....this one needs some serious improvements. I know Chick-Fil-A takes it's customer service....food....and store cleanliness very serious. This one however is the exception especially when it comes to cleanliness and organization. This locale is always messy....the condiments are always disorganized....and the lemonade on my last 3 occasions has not been good..... for lack of a better word. I am shocked and appalled really because I have been to several of these establishments and if the managers there could see this store they would be shocked as well. Eat; Drink; and be Merry my Friends.....just not at this Chick-Fil-A.,1
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Ok; yes I am writing a review for a fast food restaurant. I realize that seems a bit strange and quite possibly extremely unnecessary. I mean; fast food is fast food right? Everyone knows what their getting into and what kind of food to expect; right? While this is true I felt it was worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing Chick-Fil-A.  It's nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken. The nuggets are yummy; flavorful but not overbreaded. My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy. We also enjoyed the sweet tea which is a classic Chick-fil-A staple.  One important thing to note was that this location was super busy when we walked in right at noon but soon after we ordered our food was ready in a flash. And for those of you who have never been to CFA before? The icing on the cake is the wonderful assortment of dipping sauces to suit whatever flavor mood you are in at the moment. Or you can do what I do and open one of each and dip to your hearts desire. Who doesn't love variety?!,0
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,The only reason I give this chickfila on Tatum 2 stars is because chickfila's food is so good. BUT this chickfila is so poorly run! If you go through the drive thru expect to wait at least 10 min. Do not go when you are in a hurry. It is so slow. Also they rarely get your order correct and you MUST check your order; including your drink; before pulling away. This chickfila needs some help with speed and accuracy; it is not run like all the other chickfila's that I have visited through the years,0
cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Five stars I grew up on CFA It is Hot Good and well Extra Good. Order what you like its all GOOD. All white mean chicken the king of sandwiches when it comes to chicken. The fries are the best ever to touch your lips and gums. They have pure honey & they know I'm on my way so they never run out.,0
D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,So; in order to counter the bad review of KFC I did - I'd like to thank Popeye's for being right down the street from the office. The staff here is ALWAYS good; even the drive thru. And it's always quick; unlike the toher chicken place up the street.  My standard order?   Number 5 = 5 Piece strips (spicy) with biscuit and Red Beans & Rice. Root Beer to drink.  The only thing that could make it better would be Vernors in the soda machine...,1
D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,So I ordered my 3 wing meal and I'm really excited to try this chicken.  I get home (less than 5 mins away) and it's completely cold and dried out.  And I mean everything I ordered.  There is nothing worse than cold and dried out Chicken; Fries and Biscuits.  Come on how hard is it to make fresh food and know when it is not so fresh anymore.  I really wanted to like it too; so disappointing.   Unacceptable Popeyes; I'm pretty sure your founder Alvin Copland would not be pleased with your store!,0
D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,Service is very good most of the time. The spicy chicken is one of the best. It is worth the trip.,1
D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,This is one of the better Popeyes restaurants in this part of town. It is a full service location and not part of a stinky gas station or quickie store. The inside is decorated with jars of chili peppers and other fun ingredients and there is a bigger seating area than some of the others stores.   Usually stop in here when I'm in the area picking up some industrial parts for the shop. It is close to several vendors and a quick and easy meal when my stomach is growling for some Cajun yummies.  Normally order something off the Spicy side of the menu and get several Jalapenos to wash things down. The dark meat is a treat and I like to get a bunch of thighs and avoid the less juicy white meat. Must say that the Red Beans and Rice are also a favorite and like to save them for dessert.  Service is always super friendly and you will see some of the same people working here over the years. The orders come out pretty quick and the food is consistently very tasty.  Watch out for the bus load of school kids that walk over during their lunch break. The place can get really busy and the wait times can take longer than usual. Whatever happened to the lame brown bag lunches that we were forced to eat back in the days?   See ya there next time and remember Tuesday they have their 2pc chicken special for super cheap. AYEE!  3.75 STARS,1

D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,"Allow me to preface by saying that I'm rating this as a fast-food chicken joint.  Comparables are places like KFC and Louisiana Fried Chicken and Churches (etc).  I'm not comparing to Pappadeaux's or anyplace like that.  We were coming from a work out.  Didn't eat much before (hard to work out on a full stomach...sometimes get to feeling really sick when we do that).  So we were HUNGRY!  A craving for chicken was in the air; and especially Louisiana Fried Chicken.  But there was a notice on their door that the landlord had locked them out.  Consulting YELP we spotted \Popeye's\"".  So off we go!  The place didn't look special at all.  Routine fast-food look with a drive-thru.  Menu was similar to other fast food chicken places; except the \""Cajun rice\""; \""Cajun fries\""; \""red beans and rice\""; and \""Jambalaya\"".  You can get the chicken \""regular\"" or \""Cajun\"".  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I went with a deal they had painted on their window; and then ordered some extras (Jambalaya and two sides).  Then realized maybe there was a deal that would include that and cost less.  The guy looked at the total; checked his board quickly; and said that was the best way to get what I wanted.  The food took about as long as expected for a fast food chicken joint.  The fries were like most seasoned fries I've had.  Maybe a little more kick; but not much more.  They were very good; but didn't jump up and say \""Cajun\"" to me.  The Cajun rice was similar to a dirty rice (Cajun); and was good.  Not spicy (hot); but very tasty.  The Jambalaya was also good.  Again; not spicy.  Not comparable to Pappadeaux's.  But good.  We ordered half/half for the chicken so we could try the regular and the spicy.  The regular was like KFC used to be long ago (when KFC was \""Kentucky Fried Chicken\""; and was good).  It was your basic good fried chicken.  The spicy was a bit inconsistent.  Some pieces were \""I feel the burn\"" while others were more mild.  I preferred the spicy anyway.  Good fried chicken with a bit more flavor.  Frankly; I prefer the food at Louisiana Fried Chicken; but that doesn't do much good since they are evidently out of business (unless they can pay-off the landlord and get un-locked-out).  Popeye's was very good for what it is.  I foresee Popeye's being our new Cajun chicken joint for now.  If LFC comes back I may have to re-evaluate.  But we were very happy with the food we got here.  In fact; we even had the leftovers for lunch today!  :-)""",1
D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The service is fast and the food was great!!,1
D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,Poor customer service from this restaurant that shares space with a Circle K. Chicken was flavorless and some pieces were over cooked. Our order took nearly 15 minutes to put together because they were filling other orders while they waited for enough fries to complete our order. They did offer compensation but only after we complained about the six counter orders they filled while we waited. We have no idea how many drive thru orders were filled in that time frame. We used to think customer service was poor in New Jersey. The greater Phoenix area is worse by far.,0

M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,"Food was okay but staff was unfriendly. Order a kids meal and was charged for a regular meal. When I mentioned that I order a kids meal the cashier looked at me and asked \Are you sure?\"" Horrible experience.""",0
M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,I'll preface this by saying I'm a chipotle guy but I have had qdoba at different locations before and having just moved across the street I thought I would give this place a try. I'm usually a very generous grader however this qdoba location is not good. I ordered a bowl with steak I love the fajita veg they didn't have any.. Bright spot was the guy serving me the bowl said he would be happy to make me some which would take about 5 minutes. I went there for quick food I didn't  feel like waiting.. When you see the fajita veg running low cook more Don't just leave the empty container with 4 or 5 strands of vegetables sitting in it. I could see if it was almost closing time and you didn't wanna cook more so if wouldnt go to waste but this was only 645.. So that was a bummer lets keep going I got my extras bring it home and I was thoroughly disappointed the steak tasted like it has been sitting in the container all day (which it probably had) and the rice was super crunchy and undercooked overall not a good experience staff was friendly enough but obviously not on top of the ball will not be back..,0
M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,Usually this place is good. I like it better than Chipotle but tonight was honestly just terrible. I ordered a burrito online and everything was correct; picked it up 15 minutes later. When I got home all it had on it was shredded beef; guacamole; beans and rice! I ordered a burrito with roasted corn salsa; cheese; guacamole; beans and rice; ancho chile sauce. The rice was extremely hard and the avocado tasted terrible. I just can't believe that I was charge $7+ dollars for a burrito that didn't even have half the things I ordered! I won't be going here anytime soon. If you can't get a burrito correct than why are you working there?!,0
M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,Obviously; this place is very similar to Chipotle but in regards to flavor this place slightly edges out Chipotle for me. For one; you can order nachos with an actual 3 cheese queso as opposed to just grated cheese at Chipotle. Also; when you get a salad here it comes in a tortilla bowl score! The service at this location can be spotty at times but bear with them because the food is worth the wait. Also; this location gives out $6 meal coupons on the back of Safeway receipts ( the meal coupon  includes any entrée and a drink for only $6 buck; can't beat that with a stick!). The actual dining area is okay; but again their service needs work so sometimes you will see dirty tables. Overall; I'd say find the coupons; use them and get your food to-go; BOOM!,0

M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,Never have I ever been so disappointed at a Qdoba. I live right behind this location and I've come many times before. It's never been the fastest and I've never seen more than two people in the front; but today is just ridiculous. It's never been that busy that I've had to wait that long for my food anyways; and I've never been in a hurry so I never minded that it's not the fastest. I am standing in line and I haven't even ordered my food yet; which I only came for chips and Queso - As soon as I walked in I was surprised to see the line so long it curved around; 14 people in line - one person at the front making the food and ringing up the order. What the hell? It's noon; why do you only have one person at the front counter? There is a gentleman coming back and forth to put the steak and chicken on the grill; but that's it. Three people have left in the time I've taken to write this review. Im giving two stars because the food has always been the fantastic Qdoba I love; and I am one of the few Qdoba advocates I know down here - I hate Chipotle. But there is NO excuse for only having one person at the front over the noon hour.,0
M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,Decided to walk to grab some lunch since I live right behind this Qdoba; left my apartment at 10:55 ensuring I would be there after the 11:00 am open time. Got to Qdoba at 11:05; and it hadn't been open yet. There was another lady already waiting before I got there and I could see the lady inside running around getting things ready; I know she saw both of us waiting. They unlocked the doors around 11:12; no acknowledgment to me or the other customer or any apologies on opening late; us having to wait; etc. I wasn't even asked what I wanted to order or anything the lady behind the counter just looked at me and waited for me to say something. She continued to talk to the staff person in back while she did my order. I'm done with this location; the huge lack of customer service is such a turn off. I rather drive a half hour out of my way then come here again.,0

M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,Awesome Friendly Staff  Fast; Reliable Service  Reasonably Priced Healthy Options  The only downfall I have is the stinginess in the portion sizes of the chicken and steak; so make sure you clarify that you are getting the right amount of meat.  Aside from this one drawback this place is great.,1
M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,I always come in here hoping for a better experience than the last; but they always disappoint. Yes the food is good but the service is terrible. The staff is never friendly and they make you feel like you are bothering THEM by ordering a meal. I've never had a positive friendly experience in this location; which is sad; because that's what keeps me away.,1

M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,Terrible experience. I have been to Qdoba before and have always had fast; friendly service and decent meals. We recently moved to the Ahwatukee area and decided to stop in at this location for a quick dinner. It was not busy; there was one other couple in front of us in line. Standing in line I noticed a large pile of chicken sitting to the side of the grill with flies buzzing around it and quickly decided I would try the steak instead.  I do not know if they were running out of inventory or if the staff was just being lazy but never in my life have I seen such embarrassing sized portions from any Qdoba. My favorite part of Qdoba has always been eating half and saving half for later; this time none of it was worth saving.  As we watched our food being made we knew something was not right; so I politely asked why the portions seemed to be much (MUCH) smaller than what we were used to. The girl making our burritos literally rolled her eyes; laughed and offered extra meat for an extra charge. I did not want extra meat; I wanted the same size bowl I was used to getting. We declined; and she seemingly pawned us off on the other girl working.  As we approached the register we asked another employee (possibly the manager); why the portions seemed to be half of what we are normally used to getting at Qdoba.  She seemed nervous; but assured us the portion sizes were correct. After our 2 minute car trip home and opening our bag of food we realized this $18 meal would definitely not satisfy our hunger. To top it off; the steak tasted like it had been soaked in some type of oil; and everything was completely cold! Not  even lukewarm; cold. I hate to complain; but after this past visit we will not be returning to Qdoba.   I have attached a picture of the food we received (next to an 8oz bottle of vitamins for comparison) for viewers to see how small the burrito actually is.,1
M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,I think most people in the valley are familiar with burritos so this is more of a thumbs up for this location. The main reason I come here is for the vegetarian pinto beans ( the other burrito place adds delicious pork ).  The veggie burritos are good and they aren't cheap with the guacamole.  The service lately is kind of hit or miss and they are always low on stuff.  THey are always really friendly; but they need to puck up the food prep planning a bit.,1
M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,This place just opened today; and doesn't even have a phone yet. So tonight things were a bit hectic; but service was good. I got a naked burrito (similar concept to Chipotle's Burrito Bowl) and it was pretty good. I like that Qdoba has more choices for toppings than Chipotle. I think it'll take a few visits for me to fine-tune the ingredients that I order; but Qdoba definitely has promise!,1

M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,"If I could rate this place as a zero; I definitely would. My husband and I decided to try Qdoba; as we had never been there before. Stopped in for a quick bite of lunch; I ordered a shredded beef burrito; my husband; a veggie burrito. The girl behind the counter looked confused when I told her I wanted shredded beef on my burrito and that it wasn't a veggie burrito. After understanding that I actually wanted beef; she put three whole pieces of meat. I seemed to have inconvenienced her in asking to put more meat on my burrito. My husband then had to remind her that he'd ordered a veggie burrito; and actually wanted veggies on it. Once we finally made it down the line; we went to pay for the food. The girl rambled what the price was and before we knew it; we had paid almost $23 for two burritos; chips and a small drink. Something definitely did not add up correctly. We looked at the prices we were charged on the receipt and compared to what they had on the menu boards; and realized we were charged significantly more than what the menu stated. My husband went to ask the girl behind the counter what was going on and she said they had changed the prices. She then called the manager over; who again; reiterated that the menu prices had changed; they just hadn't received the updated price signage. There was nothing anywhere in the store stating that any of their prices were changed; we had to hear about it after we were already over charged for our items. At this point in time; the \manager;\"" interrogated us and asked; \""didn't you look at the price on the pos system before you paid??\"" The pos system didn't display what we had ordered nor did it display the price. My husband demanded to be refunded back the difference; and the manager said they were not allowed to give refunds; and they would need to call corporate in order to get one. We were interrogated again and asked if we had already started eating the food; which was said in a very sarcastic way by the manager. She then spent a decent amount of time on the phone with \""corporate\"" asking if she could give a refund; to which \""corporate\"" offered to give us food vouchers for another visit. As we don't live in the area; there was no way we were going to accept that and wanted a refund of the difference. The manager said she didn't know how to use the computer or issue a refund for what we were asking; and ended up refunding the entire meal. She then acted as if she was doing us a favor by allowing us to keep our food items. We probably would have been better off not even touching the food; and going somewhere else. The four pieces of meat that were in my burrito were not very tasty; and overall the food quality was very poor. To top off the experience; the cashier mishandled the customers food behind us. Initially refused to offer her food at the menu price; and treated them worse than she treated us. The best part of this experience was walking out the door; and vowing to never come back.""",0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Love love love; and so excited a new location is opening by my house...well; could be dangerous. This is perfect for healthy living on the go.   Went for dinner & got a 2nd salad for lunch the next day. They are huge! Very fresh & filling. Tried the Greek & Caprese; both with gardein...good choice.   The warm quinoa bowl or the banana kale smoothie are also good pics for a quick breakfast.   Service is quick & friendly. Love that they support locally; like Bergies for coffee. Will definitely come back.,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Friendly staff.Great selection. Love that you can make any salad a wrap and have 2 wrap choices. Good value as portions generous. Ingredients very fresh. Love that they asked how I wanted dressing..only complaint was that the shrimp was a little bland and undercooked. I will definitely be back and highly recommend going there. This place takes customer service and their product very seriously..,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I just tried this place and it was fantastic! There are many options to choose from and anything is customizable. All the salads are only 5.55; which is a fantastic deal considering how huge they are! Produce was all fresh and the service was fast and friendly. This is a great alternative for fast food places. I will definitely be going here again. Heads up; this is not a dine in type place. It has a walk up window with outdoor seating; and a drive thru. However the outdoor seating has misters and is shaded :),1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,What an incredible concept. It seems as though this would be a bad idea to specialize in one thing; but it's actually genius. I watch what I eat carefully so I'm always interested in finding healthy alternatives to the junk food that is taking over this area; so to find a place like this made me jump for joy! This is really a hidden gem!  They have an EXTENSIVE menu of salads and they all sound delicious. They also have wraps and breakfast foods so you can pretty much stop by here night and day and get super healthy food for breakfast/lunch/dinner. They also have a calorie count on the board so you can make the healthiest choice for you. I like this and wish all restaurants would do this.  I pulled up to a very friendly voice offering help and decided on the Santa Fe (it was a tough choice!). They ask about dressing and whether you want it on the side or tossed (which is so nice) and then you seriously have your order almost as soon as you pull to the window.   The reason for the four stars is because of the visibility issue below and the fact that; while this salad was DIVINE; the items that go in the salad are lots and lots of lettuce; little bits of everything else. This particular salad had red pepper (which I did not taste); corn; tomatoes; beans; cilantro; jicama and cojito cheese. There was very little of any of that; but enough to know that I would eat this every day if the mixings were more abundant. I understand the salad is less than $6; but it really is a lot of lettuce with just a tease of flavor making you want more. Which you don't get. The flavors are delicious together; they really know what they're doing with a salad; but just give me more filling items and I'll be SO happy!   The ONE thing I would seriously advise (and this actually peeves me so much thinking about it that I have to try not to blow my top) is that when you pull OUT of the drive-thru that you go SLOWLY and look BOTH WAYS. I almost got t-boned by a truck hauling a$$ through the parking lot because I couldn't see as I was pulling out. They have some serious issues with visibility there. It's dangerous - the guy swerved hard to miss me.   So; I'll definitely be back; but hope they fix the minor issues to make this a standout amongst junk food that has taken over everywhere!,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Just moved to AZ and found this little gem! I love the concept and after trying it I love the food. I ordered the cobb salad with shrimp on top. Fresh ingredients; great dressings; you really can't go wrong. I will definitely be back to try all their varieties! Highly recommended! Fast food is now healthy!,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,"LOVE this place and so glad they opened in Gilbert; giving people a healthier alternative for \Fast Food\"". I'm writing this review as I'm devouring my Caprese Salad (with chicken and added cucumbers- delicious!) I LOVE that they have now added a breakfast menu; and not because I've actually tried any of those items; though I've heard they're great; but they are now open earlier so I can grab my lunch for the day at 8am and breeze through the line (seriously; took 90 seconds this morning!) Their passion fruit ice tea is delicious; and every salad I've had is awesome though I keep coming back to the Caprese and you can't beat $1.29 to add chicken! My ONLY complaint is that for the size of the salad (huge) the little side of dressing that they include isn't enough (and I'm not a crazy person when it comes to dressing; I use it sparingly) so either request another side of it; or expect to have some lettuce untouched. Overall; great food and great; speedy service. I really hope they do well and I will continue to be a loyal patron!""",1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Finally made it to try Salad and Go. I live a good distance away so I hadn't had a chance.   I was the 3rd car in line to order.  The ordering process was fast and efficient.  It took less than 5 mintues to make it to the window.   I got the special (written on a board by the menu): strawberries; blue cheese; croutons; almonds; berry vinegrette.  I added chicken since this was my lunch.    Very fast service.  The gal at the window was very friendly.    The salad itself was huge.  Very large portion.  Lots of strawberries.  Could have used some more blue cheese.  The chicken portion was kind of small; I'd l'd like to see more for the additional charge.  But overall the salad was delicious and I will be going back for sure.    The menu has lots of options; with the addition of different proteins and different dressings; the options are endless.    I heard there will be more locations soon;and I'm really looking forward to one coming closer to my home.    This is such a great option for a quick meal on the go that doesn't include fries and a soda.  This is such a great idea.     I am very happy and will return when in the area,1

nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,YUMMY!  I went  to Salad and Go for lunch with my kids recently because I wanted to support them and their mission of good for you fast food. Yes; the wait was long; but I was patient because they had just opened and I am sure they are still working out the kinks. I love the fact that they don't automatically put meat or dressing on their salads and that you can order any salad as a wrap. A wrapped salad is easier to eat while you drive. I will be back!,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,A drive-through salad restaurant is a dream come true!   If only they were open at 6am so people could pick up a salad to take to work!   Everything tasted very fresh; and they automatically offered dressing on the side.  Thanks!  So why only 3 stars?    The first time I went I ordered a Greek salad.  It was just ok; which is a shame since Greek is a fave.  No pepperoncinis; very few tomatoes; and were there Kalamata olives?   I just don't remember them.  The dressing was just salty instead of savory and flavorful.  The next time I got a Santa Fe.   DELICOUS!   FABULOUS!   The only problem here is that a Santa Fe salad should have a lot more varieties of lettuce:  add some arugula and field greens.  I will be back again and again.  Hopefully I will be able to upgrade my review next time.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,"Service was great; a lot of salad for not a lot of money which is why I heard to try it; \good bang for your buck; AND it's healthy\"" BUT It is truly the FAST food of salads; the quality was not there. I ordered a Greek salad- LOTS of lettuce; not very many other ingredients; an the dressing.. :-( Honestly; what makes a salad is the dressing!! The main reason I get a Greek salad is it is one of the lower calorie yummy dressings with the most flavor. Not this one; it's thick; creamy; bland and didn't add flavor at all. I'd rather get a 5 piece chicken nugget and a side salad at Wendy's that has much better dressing; much more satisfying; less calories AND less money.""",1

nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,"Great concept for the \on the go; no time to cook\""; person like me.I have always liked the convenience of fast food and now there is a healthy; delicious option with Salad and Go. I live in Central Phoenix and make it a point that anytime I'm in the Gilbert/Chandler area to stop by and grab lunch; or a salad to save for dinner. My three favorites: Spinach and Smoked Bacon; The Santa Fe; and The Asian. The portions are great for the price; huge bowls of mixed greens; tossed in handcrafted dressings; with fresh; delicious proteins available; my favorite salad topper- the grilled flank steak; Yum! Although the drive thru line is long; give it a shot; its worth it. And if you don't want to wait in the drive thru than park; and walk up to the window. Be patient; this food isn't sitting premade and ready to go; it's fresh and made to order. Good things come to those who wait; I can't wait for the restaurant to expand. Kudos to you guys at Salad and Go; for giving us a healthy option to the run of the mill; greasy burger joints that we are all guilty of stopping by for a quick bite.""",0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,So happy this place is finally here. Me and my family have visited quite a few times and it has been wonderful each time. The wait can be a little long but it's not like there is employees sitting around playing on their phones; twiddling thumbs. I have seen them through the window-HUSTLING trying to be the quickest they can be and i appreciate you guys. EXCEPTIONAL customer service. I think it's silly how people are complaining about the sizes and prices. These are very generous sizes in my opinion. I usually can only eat half at a time and to say they are overpriced?? Did you know they use organic and local ingredients? I saw that is an AMAZING price for what you get. My favorite is the Greek salad super yummy. Me and my husband will continue to send people your way and congrats on doing so well! #supportlocalbusinesses,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Went and grabbed dinner around 4:30. The drive-through was only a few cars in; but still went to the walk-up counter instead. I had the Spinach Bacon salad and my daughter had the BBQ. We had our order in about 5 minutes after ordering.  Unfortunately they forgot the avocados on the BBQ salad. The portions were decent sized; I wasn't stuffed after eating; but was satisfied. I will definitely give their other salads a try.  I see from other reviews they have been running out of product and messing up orders. I would say since they have only been open a couple of weeks to give it another chance. Opening a new business is always a little bumpy. Hopefully they will be reading these reviews so they can correct some of these issues.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Fantastic; healthy; and quick. Stopped by on Thursday evening in hunt for something quick and healthy. I ordered the Greek salad with chicken and my husband had the Louie salad with chicken.  The drive thru took about 3 min.  The employee at the window was very friendly while we waited.  Both salads were excellent. Great portions.  Super yummy.  Felt great after eating them.  We will be back soon!,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,"Update: Still DELICIOUS. Decided to try out their breakfast this morning and it didn't disappoint. I had the peanut butter power wrap. A pretty basic idea that I remember having as a kid; but it's still yummy and a great quick breakfast. I was in the drive thru at 7 AM and I asked if I could order a salad; LOL. Of course they said \Yes\"" so I got one for lunch!   Have I mentioned I love this place?!  A suggestion for Salad N Go: Start a punch card system.""",0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,After hearing about this place from a friend; I decided to check it out tonight.  The service was GREAT the food was pretty good.  I like this concept a lot.  I got the Louie with chicken and mozzarella instead of blue cheese.  The portion size was really good.  I would try this place again should I be in the not-wanting-to-cook mood.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I was excited to give this place a try after reading a lot about it.  I had been craving the Caprese with Steak salad.  Get there to order at 4:30 pm on a Friday; and they tell me they are all out of steak. OK; so I settled for the chicken and ordered two other salads to take home for the wife and daughter that they had picked out on the web.  For a salad place; it took a long time to get the food.  Get home and one of the salads is wrong. Not even close to what I orderded and talk about stingy with dressing.  For the cost; it would be much cheaper to make my own salad at home not to mention quicker and I would know it was the salad I wanted.  I doubt that I will eat there again. There is no compelling reason to do so.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Holy crap- if you love bang for your buck; then you're at the right place! HUGE salad and good size soup. I've never tried this place before and I will be back.  Quick service also.,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,This is my family's newest favorite fast food choice; and I hope we never get tired! Their menu was easy to understand and everything we've ordered has been great. I haven't tried the drive-through yet but my wife says it's easy to order and quick there as well. I'd recommend the Caesar salad with chicken!,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,We eat there 3 to 4 times a week. We love all their salads; and their honey wheat wrap is incredible. All the crew is always very nice; especially to our dogs. The owners really care and put their hearts into the business. They are all about customer service. Can't express enough how fresh and very tasty the salads are (huge portions). We eat at both locations!,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I love Salad and Go. This location (the first location ever opened BTW) is right by my work so I go pretty often. The service just gets better and better every time I go. I really enjoy all the salads and smoothies. There isn't a bad one in the bunch. The seasonal options keep every visit interesting. The seasonal strawberry almond with ginger dressing salad is definitely one to try when they have it on the menu. I read the following article a while back about Salad and Go and think it is important to share:  http://saladandgo.com/blog/i-just-want-you-to-know-that-you-saved-my-life/   The article points out exactly why Salad and Go is truly great! I really hope they continue to succeed and hope they can open more and more locations. Thanks Salad and Go for taking such pride in providing a great fast and easy option for good food.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,My only complaint is there aren't more of these. I was so impressed with the concept; I actually went to their website to inquire about a franchise... (which I can't afford; but still...)   Huge portion sizes; super quick service; reasonable prices.   Gourmet custom salads on the go... they definitely have a niche vs. taking forever to go to paradise bakery.,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,First time here and I ordered the seasonal green salad with steak. The girl who took my order was really friendly which good customer service is a huge deal to me. On top of that my salad was fresh and delicious and the perfect size. It's so nice to be able to get a yummie salad to go! I just wish this place was closer to me.,1

When our food was ready we called the kids over to get there individual orders.  My youngest said \it is done already?

You are absolutely magnificent.""",1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,This is really simple - start a fast; simple; healthy restaurant and provide friendly; fairly quick service - and I'm a fan for life.  I just hit Salad and Go for about the 4th time last night - drive through every time - and it's just fantastic.  Everything is super fresh; portions are good; and friendly; energetic youngsters serving the goods.  I'm sure I'll hit this place at least twice a week - it's awesome.,1

It was fresh; and tasty. They ask you if you want the dressing on the side so you can add it yourself; or have it already placed into salad. That it's a drive-thru is incredible. This will be a go-to spot prior to going to work! This sort of restaurant is so overdue. The staff was very pleasant; and the service was fast.""",1

nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Although I agree with some of the Yelpers below about a few speedbumps regarding service; the portion size was perfect and I love seeing a quick and healthy alternative when it comes to drive through meals.

Today was my fourth visit and I was actually craving it. That's a good sign.  They've obviously worked out whatever service issues they've had because I've never waited more than a few seconds at the drive-through window to get my order.  The salad is delicious and filling and I'll be going back . This is a place I hope succeeds. I only wish they posted calorie info...it is supposed to be healthy after all.,1

The salads are a great size and about $6 each; service is fast and friendly; and the location is easily accessible. I can't wait to try their breakfast some time!,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Had the Cobb Salad in a wrap. It was huge and the price was right. This place is good and I love local and original restaurants. It is primarily a takeout place; but there is an outdoor seating area that is well shaded and has a mist system. Food was good; service was quick; and all in all I am sure to be back.,1

Or in a pinch;  I'll go to Subway; because I personally think yoga mats are delicious with a little mustard and pickle.  What can I say about Salad and Go that hasn't already been said about the wheel; sliced bread; or purses with designer labels printed in patterns all over them?   I could pretty much eat here exclusively.  If I were still a student I probably would.  The service is always fast and friendly.  Even if I go during peak lunch or dinner hour there is a never a long wait.  When I see more than 4 cars in the drive-through I use the walk-up window.   I enjoy the seasonal offerings; but I always end up going back to my favorite \""The Greek\"".  The salads are BIG; and they'll keep well if you ask for the dressing on the side.  It's obvious that they are made fresh.  There are always a pile of staff chopping away in that tiny kitchen.  I absolutely LOVE the place!  The only thing I would suggest would be to add more high quality protein options; maybe partner with a local sustainable supplier.  I currently add my own protein at home because I haven't found the addition offered to be satisfying.   But again - the place is great.  I wish they'd open up on every corner.   We need more healthy options like this.""",1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I went to the new Salad and Go on Higley and Williams Field Rd. It just opened a couple of weeks ago and was excited to see what it was all about. I ordered the cobb salad and was very disappointed. First there was lots of lettuce and it looked clean and fresh. However the rest of the ingredients were very much lacking: eggs; blue cheese crumbles (almost none); bacon (chopped so fine and spooned on to) and 1 very tiny slice of avocado. There were lots of tomatoes. Since I didn't open it until I got home I was pleasantly surprised at the size. That being said they gave one little container of water downed blue cheese dressing. No way would it have dressed the entire salad. I was willing to pay the $5.69 for the salad but did not get my money's worth with the extra ingredients for sure. I will go back and order a different salad to see if I can get a 5 star salad next time. I would certainly look closely at the list of ingredients and compare it to what you actually get.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I was skeptical when my friend and I pulled into this standalone with a drive-thru that served nothing but salad. There are so many ways this could have gone wrong; but Salad and Go gets it right!  Essentially you have about 7-8 different salads to choose from which you can add steak or chicken to which is a must in my opinion. Alone; I'm sure their salads are great; but I think 95% of the reason people inherently hate salad is because they aren't doing it right. Add some protein!   The salad choices are pretty standard-caesar; caprese; cobb; etc. What makes them not so ordinary is the fresh ingredients and the fact that this is a quick and healthy lunch option. You can even get your dressing served on the side too if you're into that. They don't skimp on the toppings or the protein (if added); making their salads far above average for a fast food (and even sit down) option. They have two seasonal specials every day; a soup and a salad. The salads are a good size and can be ordered in wrap form which I prefer only because it's less of a task to eat.  My only real ding on this place is the forks they provide. This sounds silly; but if you're going to serve a good; hearty salad; it should come with a fork that gets the job done. The forks here are kind of terrible and frustrating to use because they're so tiny. Honestly; if they didn't have the option to get the salad in wrap form; I'd bring my own fork.  Other than that; this place is a delicious and quick lunch option in the Gilbert area. Bring your salad-hating friends here; this is a conversion experience!,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I was very excited to try this place; being on the go all the time its hard to eat right. I waited in the drive thru (start to finish) for 20 mins. When I finally got the chance to order they were out of the protein I wanted. Since I wasn't able to back up and leave; I felt obligated to try some thing else. For the $2 upgrade I got the flank steak added to my order (instead of the preferred chicken). The disappointment came when I finally arrived home to eat it.. I had a total of 4 bites that's included the steak. The dressing on the lettuce was almost nonexistent. In my mind I paid $8 for a tortilla and lettuce...  I realize this is a new location and they are trying to get their flow down; but when you are out of product; with ridiculous wait times; what is the positive here? It would have been nice if they had notified people that they were out of product prior to getting up to the window. I would have left and you could have possibly left a different impression in my mind.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Amazing!  I'm not going to lie; I'm not a salad girl.  I've never liked it and had a hard time wanting to eat it.  Then a co-worker convinced me to get lunch here one day.  I've not only gone back repeatedly; but I've gotten my husband and children into it as well; and have recommended it to many family members and friends.  My husband is diabetic; and it's so nice to have a place to go where I don't worry about what he's ordering.  The Caesar salad with the light dressing and the shrimp is something I actually crave now.  Everything I've tried has been wonderful.  The ONLY downfall is that there is just the one location.  It's kind of far from my work so I don't get to grab lunch from here very often.  Other than that; this place is totally awesome!,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Where has this place been all my life? I would love a Salad and Go on every corner. No longer is limited time an excuse to make poor dietary choices.  Enough of my rant...tried this place for the first time today and already know I'm going back tomorrow. Mr. and I shared a breakfast wrap that was packed with great breakfast flavors such as savory bacon and seasoned potatoes paired with greens and pico de gallo. Truly a breakfast of champions. I also purchased a salad for lunch (to be eaten later) and am impressed with the quality of the ingredients awaiting me.  Quick and friendly service as well,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Simple concept; executed very well.  Fresh salads; made to order; and pretty affordable.  I don't give 5 stars to many businesses; but Salad and Go is doing everything right.    I'm not a big fan of salad; but for a healthy alternative; it is really good; and there's lots of variety.  I've been twice so far; and will probably become a regular.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,very good option when you feel like eating out but have to stick to a meal plan. I usually get the warm berry quinoa bowl it's delicious! I have also tried the spinach bacon and egg bowl very good as we'll and fully loaded! I was surprised when I took my husband today he ordered the spinach and bacon wrap with steak and he loved it I am so glad he approved he said he wants to come back :),0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I stumbled across this place as I was going to the bank. It's a small little place where you go up to the window and order. You can't go inside to sit and they have 3 small little tables outside. I got  their BBQ ranch salad. The salad was ok and reasonably priced.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Excellent salads! You can't beat this level of quality; and service for these prices and convenience. They were even nice to our dog that they saw in the car. They are restaurant quality.,1
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I couldn't wait for Salad and Go to open.  I was there on their first day and I have to say; that first salad was a little disappointing.  My Chicken Caesar Salad was so salty I could barely eat it and the diet cola; oh my; let's just say it's a good thing I'm trying to kick the diet soda habit.  Anyway; I knew they were a new business and figured I'd have to go back and give them another chance. I am SO very glad I did.  I ordered the same Chicken Caesar Salad but this time I got the dressing on the side.  What a difference; it was delicious!  I will be a forever customer now with my dressing on the side.  I am always on the go; always eating fast food so it's great to have a healthy alternative.,0
nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Really loved it! Went there today for my first time! Had always wanted to try it! i go there and i ordered; everything was perfect when i got home! Huge portion for the price! love everything and will be back very soon! I Also took my dog and the lady at the window gave her a biscuit :) A+ in my book!,1
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,This place is dead to me starting today. I used to go in there almost everyday day due to the close proximity to my house but after havering my orders messed up over And over again I no longer have the patience to deal with this water burger. Is it seriously that hard to listen to a customer when they are ordering?,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,Imagine the scene: driving through the inky dark of night; nearing the end of a cross country-road trip; and sadly assuming that you've seen the last WhataBurger you'll see for years when you left Texas. Then; miraculously; that bright Orange and White striped roof materializes through your windshield in front of you. Your girlfriend (at the time) and you let out twin war whoops; you pull over and order a Jalapeno Burger and fries even though it's nearing midnight and you've already eaten a real dinner just a few hours before. You even order an extra burger for your roommate waiting back home in LA; knowing he will probably not be interested in a cold burger that's been sitting in a car for four hours. But you wrap it up and take it home with you anyway; because you're a good friend.   This WhataBurger in Arizona was the last one I'd ever visited; and I may be overly sentimental about it. But I dream of those Orange and White Stripes; dream of returning there one day; dream of the spicy bite of the Jalapeno Burger. I dream of the infinite.,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,Ahhhhhhhh!!!! The light from the heavens above shine upon this burger joint!!! Holy grail of burgers right here!!!!   Ok ok so obviously I'm in love with the burgers here; my god I was in Phoenix for 3 days and we ate here once daily  HAHA!!!! We couldn't get enough. I had the double cheeseburger with bacon and onion. It was so tasty and juicy and the only thing that upsets me is I could only finish half of it :(   The establishment was clean the staff was friendly but the only odd thing was the way they hand out condiments; they hide them in a tray behind the counter and the tray only comes out and is offered when your food is ready and the server has to walk it to your table each order. I don't know; is it like this at every location???? Just seems a bit much to me especially if it were to get busy in there; very time consuming :/   I really wish we had this burger joint in Cali otherwise it looks like I'll be visiting Arizona more often lol,1
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,"I honestly wish I could give this zero stars because this whataburger is a piece of shit. I personally work in the food industry so I can honestly say it's TERRIBLE.   My dad has experienced bad service from here; but then this time around I also did with him as well. My dad drove 15 minutes to get our food because it's the closest one.... When he comes back home; we literally received half our food. Pissed; he calls and I call because this is ridiculous!   The manager answers my call with not much help... And says \there's not much she can do\"" so she tells me to call tomorrow because the real general manager will be there.   So my dad gets back after the *second* trip and guess what? The food is ICE cold; and when he called back the manager answered again; and she was a complete and total bitch.    Honestly; McDonalds has better service than this piece of shit; so don't go there. This place doesn't deserve customers.""",0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,I have always seen these on my trips to AZ but I have never been.  Stopped by tonight after the Diamondbacks/Cardinals game.  Went through the drive through (Open 24 hours) and ordered a double Whataburger and a medium vanilla shake.  I added cheese to my burger.....kind of lame here is that they charge you 50 cents per slice....so since I got a double burger; it was 50 cents per patty= $1.00 for cheese.  Oh well.........  My total was just under $9.00.  Here is how the burger and shake were.............  Double Whataburger w/cheese-  Damn Gina!  This thing was a hefty ass burger.  You could tell by the bag the dude handed me it was large and in charge.  I parked and unwrapped this beast.  The Whataburger comes standard with mustard; lettuce; onion; pickle and tomato.  This thing was damn tasty.  They use 100% all beef fresh meat.  While I was waiting for my food in the drive through; you could hear the sizzle on the flat top grill of freshly made hamburgers.  I was impressed!  Everything worked.  It reminded me of a Wendys type burger but better.  The patties were huge; the cheese melted nice and the mustard gave it a good tang.  I wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these burgers.  I liked it better than the burger I got last night at Lucky Boy.  Vanilla Shake-  This was a tad of a disappointment.  It was kind of icy and not as smooth as I like my shakes.  It is still a shake though and no man in his right mind would ever waste a shake.  I drank that thing till the straw hit the bottom of the cup and nothing else came out.  I don't know if I would get one again from here.  The texture was messing with my enjoyment of it.  Overall I was very impressed with the quality/taste of the burger.  The burger is a mans size burger...no skimpy shit here.  Price was a little high though and the shake was just alright.  3 stars for now.,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,Whataburger...how I love the name and I don't know why. Open 24-7; which is usually a scarey thing; they totally hammer out a fresh; yummy; fast food experience every freakin time. Whataburger? I say Whatabusiness! U guys deliver a fresh In N Out experience with the hours of a local taco stand. Bully for u Whataburger people. Of course the burgers are great....no need for me for a double; a plain ole single with cheese and bacon makes me mouth water. Whata Size it and you get a super size situation. Not my thing acutally. When I'm cheating and doing fast food; I stick to the basic small order. But I can't resist the side salad. For $3.50; u get a HUGE side salad; always fresh and always eaten after the burger to help push through the grease and carbs I've just ingested into my temple. Ok; so it's not quite a temple. Geez; give me a break. Rickie introduced to the Whataburger experience and I can't thank him enough. Well; I can; and believe I do my best if u know what I mean...wink wink. Ok; ok; enough rambling...fresh fast food u actually wait 10 minutes for is so worth it. TIP: Enjoy Amy Winehouse; I Don't Want To Go To Rehab  while ur waiting at the drive thru. God...ok; don't judge me...so I had a few shots of Patron and a Corona or two....Over and Out Yelpers!,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,I agree with my fellow yelpper; This Whataburger is the best run in town. I eat all over Phoenix Metro area; I get bad service and attitude everywhere! It's refreshing when you get the kind of attention you should get as a customer. The employees here are always polite. The food is good; and one time when it wasn't good; the manager came out and personally apologized and replaced my meal and gave me coupons. I have eaten there many times since; I will go out of my way to go to this Whataburger.,1
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,Ah! I Went today for old school lunch & had a healthy burger lunch with jalapeños and green chilies! Call me crazy;  but it hit the spot(fast food grease)! I Dine inside and the food and customer service has always been great; Very polite.,1
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,I always find this beacon of light in a dreary & dismal ghetto. It brightens my day & clogs my arteries at the same time-pure perfection. haha! Today was a more exciting day than usual for the employees and patrons of this particular location. Somebody needed some discipline next door at the lingerie shop so 15 cops later; their little circus act with a large bear riding a motorcycle and a bunch of reporters filled our afternoon with curiosity. Tho I'm sure this wasn't entirely the reasoning for the good spirits; I have to say the gentleman taking orders could have filled in with a small comedy show in between all the commotion.  Back to me....My poison of choice....Honey BBQ chicken strip sammich on Texas toast.  It's pretty delectable. I pretty much get it every time. I trick myself into thinking since it has chicken; its healthier. Today tho I tempted fate; I got a side of jalapeños to add a little fire to my taste buds. Not bad at all! Next time I'll order them on the sandwich so I can see if heating them up a bit adds a little heat.... I really like their fries when they are warm so of course I took down a couple of those but this time... You got it! I ordered the jalapeño ranch to top them off. Not impressed with that tho; the ranch lacked flavor. Oh well 1 out of 2 jalapeño attempts came out well. Since I'm a half full kind of guy; I'll call today a success.,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,I made myslef a promise not to review chains if I could help it but in this case; I can't...help it.  Whataburger is a good place to get a greasy burger..you can get jalapenos added which I love and they have a pretty decent breakfast sandwich if you're snarky in the morning and need something to remove the snark. If that doesn't work; trying ordering a Diet Dr. Pepper (or a regular one for that matter) in the morning and please use the drive-through.   The lady on the other end of the talkin' box will put on a smile on your face simply by the way she says Dr. Pepper during the order confirmation process.  She rolls the R in Pepper so beautifully; I'm fired up right now just thinking about it.  I don't know her name and I don't want to. She's just the Dr. Pepperrrrrr lady and she will remain so forever.  Do yourself a favor; go here in the morning and listen to the sweet music of the rolling R.,1
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,"For years; I have tolerated that this Whataburger is slower than sit-down dining; gets my order wrong; and overcharges me; mostly because the chain sometimes introduces menu items I like.  Today; I went in search of a jalapeño breakfast biscuit; which is a truly fine idea. At 6:45; the place was empty except for two clerks sitting in the dining area. They stared and giggled at my bemusement that there was nobody to take my order; as apparently the manager thinks it makes sense to send everybody who can operate a cash register on break simultaneously.  Only when I started to walk out did one of the staff yell for attention in the kitchen. After much yelling; somebody in back said she'd be out in a while. Since there were no other customers in the restaurant or the drive-thru; I'm not sure what was more urgent than serving an actual customer; but I've known management to set some odd metrics that get in the way of customer service.  \I give up -- you don't want customers;\"" I said; and I went to get a biscuit at the QT across the street.

2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,I wish there was a fast food restaurant that was closer to my place. They never get your order right; and you usually end up spending at least 10 to 15 minutes in the drive thru. I sat there (not late at night) and watched 8 people stand around by the drive thru window; while I waited for 10 minutes just to have my payment taken from them. After almost 20 minutes in this drive thru at 3:30 in the afternoon; I got home to discover that my order was completely wrong. Thanks whataburger; I really appreciate all that.,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,I am ashamed to be reviewing a fast-food joint but I love me some Whataburger. Specifically the #8 with a Coke. Two chicken fingers; small fries; Texas toast and white gravy. It is the only thing I ever eat here with the exception of their soft-baked chocolate cookies. Does that not sound like the dream meal to you? Well; it is to me! Yeah; it stinks waiting in line but I can't complain that they make your food fresh to order. Seriously though; W; do we need that much soda with the meals?????,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,Writing a review of a chain restaurant is like staring at the sun during an eclipse: it sounds like a good idea at the time; but...

It makes me feel like that ping pong ball in Priscilla: Queen of the Desert. Well; not *exactly* like that. This one time; after Charlie's; Robert M and I stopped by here to sober up a little in the drive-though. I ordered the chicken tenders because I wasn't eating red meat at the time. We brought our order home; I put vodka in my soda and started eating. You know that drunk delay you have? Well; I ate a whole chicken tender before I realized it was raw in the middle! Don't worry; I survived. Then this past weekend I went for a breakfast bacon sandwich and everything was perfectly cooked. And the service was splendid.   I'm certain if I keep coming back and they maintain this level of good food and service; I'll update with a higher rating. But; for now; I'm still tasting that raw chicken in the back of my throat. That; and they don't take reservations. So; there you go; so.,0

2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,This place really has gone down hill!!! 2 yrs ago they had it right; however my last 3 visits have been a complete fail!!!   Orders completely wrong and the fries were the worst I had in many years,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,Love Whataburger but very slow and poor service at this location. No ketchup; no straws; no salad dressing. Poor; poor; poor attention to detail and service.,0
2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,Big ass burgers. Damn good fast food. It's still a fast food joint so dont expect the most amazing tasting or healthy type food but its still good. Service wasn't amazing but i have no complaints about it. enjoy,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,This place is amazing. Its my favorite place for a burger this side of heaven. I agree with Yelper Ryan M. The amount of toppings that you can get on your burger is impressive. I never order fries but I still leave here completely stuffed. I tell everyone I know to try this place,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the price! But the burgers and fries are delicious. The burgers are made to order just for you! Has a good amount of toppings for your burger. The fries are amazing! They have spicy fries as well! But for the price; enjoy every bite! If anyone has an recommendations for a good burger in the valley...please let me know!!,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Stopped here with my wife and daughter after hearing a few friends say it was amazing;.........Very disappointing; I mean the burgers aren't terrible but they are not great either Just kinda there you know what I mean. pretty pricey as well I think 3 burgers and 1 large order of fries and 3 drinks was like $27. In and out is a much tastier and affordable option.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Alrighty; so I've only been here once; and that was a handful of years ago; so this review is from memory.  So at the time; this place was fairly new and everyone was talking about it; including some friends I've went to school with.  So of course I had to check it out.   My friend and I went with high expectations (before we used review websites) and the place was packed.  Dont remember exactly what we ordered; but we each got a burger; large fries; and a drink... each.  It cost a little over $30 for the whole meal.  That is nuts; it's a freakin fast food restaurant. The whole paper bag was filled with fries; which doesn't bother me; but they weren't very good.  The burger itself was average at best; not worth what we paid for though.    If we feel like spending $30+ dollars on food; I think we can skip out on average fast food.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Burgers and fries; huh? In the words of the band BNL \its all be done; woo hoo hoo.\"" I found 5 Guys to be sort of lackluster. First of all; it was extremely packed; and not much room between tables. Spills and bumoing into people were inevitable.  The menu was basic; but I guess they are trying to be great at one thing and not suck at everything. While ordering; the gal there ran thru a 20-word-per-millisecond schpeel that I'm sure she gives everyone; which I had to have her repeat. Prices could've been a little lower; and not wanting to bankrupt my paying friend; I opted to go with a water. The burger I ordered wasn't very hot when I got it; but the fries were legit.  I ended up getting sick that evening; and while I won't blatantly say it was the burger; I have my suspicions.  Honestly; I'd have to compare the food to In N Out or Wendys. Still going to Red Robin for good; quick burgers.""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I'm struggling with this review...  Great burger. Perfectly cooked; two beefy patties and you can add lots of toppings at no extra charge (like mushrooms. Yum).  But seriously; $12 for a burger; fries and a large drink is stupidly expensive.  I devoured my burger; and couldn't finish the huge order of fries; but the entire time I was scarfing it down I kept asking myself if it was worth 12 bucks.  Not really.  But damit; it was tasty.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,If you're craving a burger; this is the place to come. Great service; great food; and super fast!! We will definitely be back.,1
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Holy overpriced!  With everyone all abuzz about this place opening up in AZ; I figured we would have to give it a try sometime.  Well; we were out and about in the EV this weekend and figured now was as good as ever.  Things did not start off well.  First; the music was so LOUD!  Some poor old lady walked in and covered her ears the second the door opened.  I also hated the peanut shells.  It was stupid; poorly executed and had no business being in a fast food burger joint.  Steakhouse or BBQ place; maybe; but not here.  Apparently the ordering system is difficult because it took the 6 or so people in front of us forever to order; but for us smart folk; it takes about 30 seconds.  Now to the food.  It costs 4.89 for a single patty bacon cheeseburger.  I can get a Baconator combo at Wendy's for that price.  That's just the burger here; so for an extra 2.59 I can get frys (a generous portion at least) and another couple bucks gets me a drink.  I'm practically pushing a 10 dollar combo here!  This is fast food right?  I couldn't help but compare it to In'N'Out and this place was failing miserably!  Our food came out in roughly 5-8 minutes and we went outside to eat because the music was unbearably loud.  The frys were decent; nothing to special and I found the cajun fries to be very dry feeling in my mouth.  The burger was such a disappointment.  It was small and very smashed when I opened it.  The meat was very well done; and not juicy like they said it should be.  The bacon was decent and the cheese was well; cheese.  Overall; a pretty lame burger; especially for nearly 5 bucks!  Obviously; I was disappointed.  I know 5 bucks for a burger isn't a lot; but for fast food; it really is.  It's a shame that our President hasn't had the joy of experiencing decent burgers; because this place is not good.  This place is definitely a fail for me; but at least my food was edible.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"I've heard so much about Five Guys; so of course we had to try it.  We went with some friends that like it.  My wife is an In-n-Out fan; but for the record I wouldn't say I LOVE In-n-Out; but it's okay.  They are more hype than food to me; honestly.  Use that as your comparison to what I say here.  On to Five Guys...  Their investment in marketing is brilliant: 1 font; 2 colors: red/white.  This is a no frills place.  Don't expect to see a lot of flare here.  Red/White is all you get.  Their menu is easy.  Burger; Cheeseburger; Bacon Burger; Hot Dog (other stuff for kids).  All toppings are free.  So if you wanted a green-chile-bacon-bbq burger with onions and relish...you can get it at the same price as a bacon burger.    If there is a line and you don't know what you want; do us all a favor and step out of line.  This is a fast paced place and process orders pretty quick; so move along okay!  I got a burger and hot dog.  Hey you have to try both right?  I'll start with the dog.  Now any of you that put ketchup on your hot dog; stop reading and buy a flight to New York...you'll notice that is not allowed.  Dogs are onion/relish/mustard.  Done.  Five Guys splits their dogs down the center for faster cooking -- I LOVE this idea and already incorporated it in my own dog cooking for the kids.  The dog was a dog...good; and exactly what I expected -- was it the BEST?  No.  But it was what it advertised.  The burger -- my first attempt was onion; hot sauce.  It wasn't that great.  My ONLY complaint about these burgers is the meat itself needs more flavor.  Put some salt on those bad boys would you.  Knowing that though; understand that your burger will essentially taste like what you put on it.  If you want a plain burger; I'm positive you'll be disappointed.  My second try (not the same visit; c'mon I'm not that bad...well maybe; but not this time) I went for bacon burger with BBQ sauce and onion (note: I don't like cheese).  It was much better than my first experience.  Still wish the meat was seasoned.  Fries -- disappointing to me on first visit.  I saw \cajun fries\"" and said yum.  It's not really...it's regular fries with some sprinkle seasons.  They can do better here.  And based on the acclaimations that hang all over the place they have to some people.  I need to give the fries a second chance.  They are skin on fries though and perhaps cut to thick for my taste is what the problem is.  I like crispy fries;not soggy.  If I wanted a baked potato; I would have got one; so give me FRIES.  So why the 4 star rating?  Well if Yelp would allow half stars it'd be 3.5.  For me though; I liked this place better than In-n-Out.  If I want a better-than-fast-food burger that I can see being made and get it made-to-order; I think this will be my place.  If you want to try the dog/burger -- get the SMALL burger with your dog -- it's big enough. Trust me.  No shakes at this place though...straight up normal soda fountain.  My son had the grilled cheese (or 'girl cheese' as he calls it) and loved it.  They flip a burger bun inside out...clever.""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Yeah; it was high quality beef; but the fries were overpriced and mushy; got so many orders wrong I just enjoyed my free bacon and ask for more mustarrd and lettuce. I still like Carl's Jr sandwich with no bun; and wrapped in lettuce for fast food; and Joes Farm Grill is worth the drive for many many reasons. It was nice; but very self serving since all the decor was of the \LOOK we are awesome\"" $24 for 2 burgers fries and a drink is great. (and the bun couldnt hold up the bread; which was kinda weird; it just decenigrated. Friendly folks; Diet Mr Pibb; good music; and... overall; I recomend it if yur in the area and want a step up from drive through.)  The big deal is free condiments; but they were all sorta spartan and bland; even when I ask for a stupidly huge amount of stuff If I find myself back there; I'll ask for well done fries and see is that helps""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Love the burgers.  They are hot and juicy and  cooked to order.  Vegies are fresh and crunchy.  So you ask why not more than a 3 star review?  Because the fries suck.  Yes; that's right; they suck.  And they pile so many in your bag that no one in their right mind could ever eat them all.  Don't really want to dig through a pile of gross fries to get to my burger; Five Guys.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"So... let me tell you that I will always be and forever be an In-N-Out fan; my stopping by Five Guys was based solely on curiousity on why this burger joint was the favorite of President Obama. As I was driving down Val Vista last night; I happened upon seeing a five guys location; and at first thought it was closed because there weren't any cars parked by it but I saw the open signs; and had passed through the intersection so I had to flip-a- bitch to get back to the Dana Park Plaza. For a burger joint with national acclaim... you would think it would attract the same kind of traffic that one is accustomed with at In-N-Out but sadly not... although it was a Tuesday night so maybe it was an off night.   Walked into the store and it had the similar boards of In-N-Out in the store but not the same layout... where at In-N-Out has the look of a diner with booth seats and swivel chairs and the like; here it was signs galore advertising the greatness of Five Guys it was like Five Guys glorification with all the different accolades from news publications and food critics. And it was faux wood tables and chair with high tops too. But it's the signs that get you; they're on the walls; hanging above the counters... signs; signs; and more signs. I think a little more modesty would be best but if this is how Five Guys wishes to market their brand that's their perogative... I like a clean simple look.   Ok; so back to ordering my food. I had to ask what the difference was between a regular burger and a little burger... I was thinking patty size but was told that the regular was a double and the little was a single. I ordered a regular cheeseburger and was told that all the toppings were free in addition to; so in a way I liked that I could add all the topping without being charged an additional 50 cents but still; the price of the cheeseburger was pricey at close to $6; I also ordered a side of the regular fries. Wait wasn't long and since it was close to closing; I was able to score some additional fries. I did notice something that five guys was lacking and that was milkshakes. Milkshakes are awesome to have with a burger; and if In-N-Out and Smashburger have them why can't Five Guys have them too? But I digress.   The meal itself. So... I remember reading one sign that said; \best fries around...\"" Tried the fries and yea... they're really good! In-N-Out fries are lacking; they're on the small side and sometimes tend to get soggy barely 20 mins later; it's the type of fry that must be consumed soon. Five guys on the other make a really good fry; it has good seasoning and a slight crisp; not too crispy; and some limp to it... it's like a medium fried fry if that exists. It was good... and if I ever come back; I'd be back for an order of fries. As for the burger; a sign said; \""A taste of heaven in a bun...\"" yea... that's pushing... it's not heaven... with all my toppings of grilled onions; grilled mushrooms; lettuce; tomato; pickle and bbq sauce with the double patty and the cheese it was a stuffed burger but it wasn't like OMG this burger is bomb kinda experience. Maybe I'm spoiled by the slightly toasted buns at In-N-out and my animal style cheeseburger with the thousand island... my five guys cheeseburger can't compare. It's good but not great and yes... it's filling but not worth $6! So with the cheeseburger and fries; my total came out out to $8.64. Pricey compared to In-N-Out... where a #2 (cheeseburger; fries and drink) comes out to under $3 and add in my animal style with my neopolitan shake... it still comes out to around $5. So price comparison... In-N-Out is the cheapest; burger comparison; In-N-Out again; and fries... well Five Guys wins that. Overall appeal; and crave factor... yea... it's still In-N-Out for me... I'm not yet getting off the bandwagon.""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I'm giving this location 4 stars for the fast and friendly service we received at our visit tonight.   I'm not a big fan of their fries and their burger was just fair. The bread was nice and moist and the meat was tender but lacked seasoning. I loved the new touch soda machines and the location is fairly clean.  Is five guys my most favorite burger spot? Unfortunately not; but the experience given by the staff bumped it up a few notches. We were sitting outside and the staff came out to give us our food and even checked on us 15 min later to see if we were still doing ok. Great customer service because they really didn't have to do any of that. My guy friend would disagree with me and say that five guys is his go to burger joint but we can all agree to disagree. What I do know is that it's definitely worth a try!,1
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,The first time I went here I had a bad experience. The burger was super greasy and the fries were cold and soggy. So I decided to give it a shot again. The burger was a little better this time; but still dripping with grease. And again the fries were cold and soggy. And if you plan on eating here make sure you the only thing you have planned after is to go home to take a shower. You and you cloths are going to smell like greasy food. For paying close to $15 for a burger; fries; and a drink you would think for you enjoy your meal. And it would be very expensive for a family to dine here. The service wasn't very friendly; and it's way to loud to have a conversation with anyone. I will never eat here again.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"5 Guys opened up about 2 years ago and I have always received very consistent taste and service from this location  It is situated right next to Rumbi's Island Grill and I always struggle with healthy food or greasy food for lunch. It's a 50/50 coin toss on which one I end up walking into. (I do however prefer the 5 Guys burger to the Rumbi's burger) What I would pass on is the California Pizza Kitchen next door; man has this chain gone down hill; talk about a rip off.  5 Guys burgers & fries are cooked fresh to order; another words you have to wait for them. They cook in the open ... right in front of you ... not sure what some of these other reviews are on about.  They use fresh potatoes for their fries and fry them in peanut oil at at higher temperature than normal vegetable oil; they come out very crunchy and golden brown. They kick butt all over In & Out french fries IMO; and 1 order is enough for 2 people.   Their burgers are twice as thick as In & Out; twice as tasty IMO; and a good value when you consider the amount of toppings and meat you receive. I also like munching those \free\"" peanuts and tossing the shells on the floor while I wait for my order.  I guess I am a fan of 5 Guys burgers;  also a fan of Smash Burgers; and Delux too.                            All different; all good ... depends on my mood!""",0

ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Great experience!  The food was made to order; and the fries are excellent!  The entire staff is friendly; especially Lindsey.  She was wonderful and made our visit even better!  Burgers are very tasty; but maybe just a \little\"" pricey.    Overall a great time - we will be back!""",1
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Very disappoint in the burger!! Very sloppy presentation. Quality control isn't there. I got 3/4 of a patty and very little grilled onions and mushrooms were from a can!!! I ordered lettuce but it was sparse; too. The Burger had no flavor. However; loved the french fries and the cool soft drink machine was fun to operate. Didn't like all the yelling from the cooks. Would rather have had an IN and Out burger any day! This is certainly NOT the best burger in the Phoenix Metro area when we have Joe's Farm Grill; Delux; Zinburger and Bluburger. I don't desire to ever return and will head to IN and Out the next time for a quick burger meal that has these Five Guys beat in quality and value.  Don't waste your money.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be 5 stars. ugh; I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  I've heard such good things about this place; and was expecting it to be good; but unfortunately; it was not.  :-(  I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough; with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings; and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you; I'm a burger lover; so I'm always up for places like this.  I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not.  I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean; like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it; and the burger was okay; but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasn't looking to be \blown away\"" by the burger; but I wasn't really impressed over all.  It wasn't that great; to much on the toppings; and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho; you get a TON of fries tho.  I left feeling underwhelmed; and don't know that I will be back in the future.""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"These burgers are delicious - you need to pay this place a visit! They have no freezers at any Five Guys - only coolers; so the ground beef is always fresh - never frozen. Their simple; no-nonsense menu and decor reminds me a little bit of IN-N-OUT Burger; but the difference between them in taste is pretty obvious.  If you order what appears to be regular-size hamburger or cheeseburger; you will get two patties instead of one. For most people this is a little much; so try ordering the \little\"" version instead for a single patty.  My favorite here is a cheeseburger with ketchup; mustard; mayo and raw onions. The fries are good and a small order is more than enough to satisfy (half my bag was filled with fries in addition to the cup they placed into it with my burger).  Two things caught my attention at this burger joint that I found a little different. There are boxes of peanuts placed throughout the restaurant for you to scoop into little cardboard serving trays and snack on while you wait for your food. The other thing that caught my eye is the markerboard at the register that tells you where \""today's potatoes came from\"" (on my visit they came from Kansas).  They have a loyal following here and get pretty busy; so you if you need to grab-n-go; you can visit their website and put your order in ahead of time.  UPDATE: If you drove out of your way to this location because it was the closest one; there is good news - a new Five Guys is now open in Ahwatukee!""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,First and Last Visit. I went here with my mom as she was craving a burger. She had a bacon burger and a drink. I had a grilled cheese with jalapenos; some cajun fries; and a drink. What you notice visually at  first are the multiple; pasted-everywhere signs about how great they are. Red flag. The music was blaring so loud; and was quite a turn-off.  We found our way to the order counter; passing by the big bags of peanuts. Really? In a burger joint? Ordered; attempted to eat inside; but due to the music went outside. There are way too many fries in the order. The cajun seasoning was sparse at best. Mom said her bacon burger was good. My cheese sandwich was ok; and I liked having the jalapeno choice to put on it. I have to tell you I am unimpressed with this place. I think having the choices to put on your burgers/sandwiches are nice but the presentation was lackluster. Every order is placed in a bag as a to-go order; even if you're eating at the restaurant.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"After posting about a visit to the Tempe location on facebook; a buddy expressed a desire to check out Five Guys.  I met him at the Val Vista location today for lunch with my 4 month old and he brought his 6 year old.    As always; the place was very clean; and although it was lunchtime on a weekend; we were through the line quickly (must have been before the Mormons got out of services).  We both ordered cheeseburgers and his son got a grilled cheese; along with a large order of regular fries.  My buddy loves CheesburgerCheeseburger; so I was anxious to hear how FG compares.  He took his first bite and had a very suprisingly pleased look on his face.  The double patty cheeseburger; complete with plenty of accoutrement; was jucy and flavorful. After a previously distatetful experience with the cajun fries; the regular fries are absolutly superior.    The staff at this location gets extra points for checkin in on us (they knew we had a first timer on our hands) and going the extra mile.  I wanted my friend to check out the cajun fries; but they didn't have any cooked up; so they just gave us some spice to put on the extra fries that we had.  Then; they called the 6 year old over to the counter and gave him a WHOLE NEW FRESH bag of cajun fries.  \We didn't have any samples for you; so we decided to just cook you up a whole batch.\""  Seriously awesome service!    Sure; the lunch for 2.5 of us cost $25; and I'd only really go for something special; but I have a feeling every visit will be quite excellent!""",1

ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Found this place looking for another restaurant in the same center. It caught my attention because of all the advertisement signs claiming awards for best burger. When you have advertisement like that on the front of the store; you have to try it.   Diner type layout. Red/White design. Obviously an In & Out competition.   One sign caught my eye; \Best $5.00 Burger.\"" And that is what you get; hamburger only for $4.99. You want cheese or bacon; forget the $5.00 thought.   You can order with any toppings you want. This is nice. Don't have to worry about ordering without and then picking off what I did not want when they screw up the order.   Had cheeseburger with bacon. Mushrooms and BBQ. It was OK. Nothing to brag about.   Also ordered fries. Glad I went with regular order. When my order came out; got brown paper bag full of fries burying my burger. Had to poor out fries onto napkins on table just to get to my burger. Here is a hint; \""More does not mean better.\"" To use the words of another reviewer; just pieces of baked potato. I like a little crisp to my fry too. So when you get a large potato log; I am not impressed. Ordered them Cajun. Nothing special there either.   Typical fountain drinks and ice tea dispenser. So nothing special there...   Just one comment about atmosphere... They were playing music inside. Good music; at least for me and what I grew up with. But I don't understand why restaurants want to play music so loud; you can't have a conversation with the person across the table. This is not a night club; try during it down just a little.   Total bill out the door for just me; $11.75. A little hefty for a simple burger/fry lunch. Definitely not a place that I will remember or think of when I am wanting a burger. Would go back if I am in the area and happen to see it to remember. But when I am craving cheeseburger; I am still thinking In & Out.""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Second time through yesterday...  Down grading my review.  There is nothing that stands out to make this place better than just another burger.    I ordered with different toppings. Stayed simple with Bacon; mushrooms; and of course jalapenos.. Order fries and a drink.  $12.00..    It was just a burger.  It was o.k. but not worth the $12.00 price. Honestly; Wendy's goes down better for me. Fries are just not doing it for me. I ordered regular. Added lot's of salt and ketchup and that helped.  It must be a taste thing; I just like my fries crispy.  I would still go back if in the area and wanting a burger.  But will also favor the In & Out or other places if I am going that direction instead.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Customer service is amazing and the food is great. The staff was constantly asking how I was and if they could help me.,1
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Let me start off by saying; I walked in to this establishment wanting to give this place 5 stars.  I want it to succeed.  I wanted a damn good burger.  I've eaten Five Guys before on the east coast.  I am no stranger to their wonderful concept.  Fresh products and amazing taste at a reasonable price.  I've eaten some amazing burgers at other Five Guys places.  Every burger you order is a double.  It says on the menu \cheeseburger\"" but it's a double cheeseburger.  Also a large fry will feed 2 (I'll get to that later)  Also all the toppings are included in the price.  Their toppings are about as generous as Subways toppings.  Plenty of variety.  Both the wife and I had a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushroom; lettuce and mayo and ketchup.  It's about a 10 minute wait for your food.  They have peanuts to keep you entertained while you wait.    As I rip into this greasy bag of goodness; I notice that my burger looks terrible.  I mean worse that any burger I have ever had at an greasy fast food joint.  The bottom bun is ripped to shreds; the toppings are falling everywhere including the meat and cheese.  Did the cook miss and not bother to fix his mistake?  At first I thought they served me a single burger but then under all the cheese I see another patty the size of a silver dollar.  I was so hungry and with my family; I was not in the mood to complain (oh and I can complain) I ate that burger in pieces because it was impossible to pick up.  I was so sad.  My wifes burger was fine.  She loved it but has had better.  The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.  They are fresh cut and cooked to perfection.  Best part about them; they fill up the container then add an additional scoop in the bottom of the bag.  Overall; I am going to give this place one more shot.  One more opportunity to show me why this place is Zagat rated.  If it doesn't you better believe this time I am going to get my money back.  Let me know how your experience went here.  I hope it was an isolated incident.""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,My first time trying Five Guys and  I was told that this place would rival In 'n Out. I found it hardpress to believe since In n Out--come on...unless you're Shake Shack you can't compete.   I think what Five Guys has over In n Out is the fact that they have a ton of toppings you can add for free - my favourites being grilled mushrooms and fresh jalapeño pepper (SO SPICY). I also added lettuce; tomatoes; onions (They have grilled and raw); and pickles- it ended up being a pretty big burger; even though I ordered the small. In fact; the small is pretty filling regardless. The difference between the regular and the small is simply the number of patties. The regular size gives you two.  I like their fries better than in n out's but it was waaaay too salty; especially the cajun fries; was is just their regular fries sprinkled with an abundance of cajun seasoning. Get the small portion and you'll be good. If you get the regular you won't finish. If you get the large; they put a giant cup in your bag and then fill the BAG with fries. You'll have fries coming out of your ears.  The price is actually not that cheap. My water and my small burger worked out to be $8. I would say that In-n-Out definitely wins on all levels except for the quantity of ingredients available. But this place is still good.  I am; however; disappointed that they have no milkshakes.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Took the kids out for diner and wanted something different. I kept driving buy Five Guys on the Way to California Pizza Kitchen and I always wanted to try it out. So we decided to try it this evening.  The atmosphere is fantastic. They give peanuts out for free and you can throw the shells on the floor; so the kids had a blast. The soda machine is really cool too. Like nothing I've ever seen with a huge selection of different drinks. You really have to see it.  First off I thought it was a little expensive.  The hamburger was a little under cooked but even so the taste was eh. I've had much better and I haven't tasted much worse.  They give you a heaping order of fries and they tasted ok but nothing special.  One thing that struck me was how really uninterested their employees seem to be.  Most places are making a better effort of greeting you; asking you how things are; and saying goodbye. There is obviously no training or effort to great customers or treat them friendly in any way.  My kids had a blast and they loved it but we won't be going back.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had; however; it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce; tomato; etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also; the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said; a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods.,1

ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"For a gal who's not a huge fan of red meat; Five Guys has made a burger lover out of me.  I've been to two locations - the one on Val Vista; and just yesterday I visited the new one in the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Both have been awesome!  Like I said; I'm not normally a burger eater.  But my boyfriend is a Five Guys fan; and his son has recently developed a taste for cow.  So I decided to be a good sport and give it a try.  I have to say; one of the things I love most about Five Guys is that you can get any & all toppings added for free.  Yep; FREE.  Now; the burgers aren't exactly cheap; but still; free toppings are a nice perk.  The place is very casual - you order from the counter; and they call your number when it's ready.  I ordered the \junior\"" cheeseburger; which was pretty darn big!  The regular burgers have two patties; so make sure you're really hungry if you order one.  I added lettuce; ketchup; mustard; mayo; grilled onions; and pickles to mine.  Yum!  It's a good thing they wrap the burgers in foil so you can unwrap a little at a time - the toppings fall out otherwise!  We got fries the first time we went; and they were awesome; but this time we knew we probably wouldn't have room; so we just stuck with the burgers.  In summary: the buns were soft; the meat was perfectly cooked; and we all left with full bellies and smiles on our faces.  For a simple burger joint; you can't ask for much more than that.  :)""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"I don't discriminate against a good tasting burger. Five Guys does not disappoint. Their cajun fries are good (and please note their \small\"" size is not small at all). You select all your toppings when you order (tomatoes; mushrooms; onions; BBQ or A1 sauce; etc). If you haven't tried one of their burgers; don't pass this place up.""",0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,My first time here I didn't think it was as good as all the hype people told me about it; but the bext few times I realized their burger is Amazing and the fries are the best thing.  Be sure to order the regular fries; you get a large portion.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,When my parents told me this place was amazing. I knew it would have to be to please them. They were right;  five guys has delicious burgers and the fries just taste like real potatoes so that is always a plus!  Service was really good and they more options for toppings then most other places. Overall it was a good experience.,1
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I've never had a bad experience at 5 guys in my life and I have went to several locations on several occasions.  Tonight; however; was different.  Messed up order twice; cold and hard buns; cold burger; and staff that spent too much time dicking around and not enough time doing their jobs or providing the type of service 5 guys is known for.  Disappointed and will not be back to this location :(.  Sad considering it's down the road from my house!,1

ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I had to down rate my review from a 5 to a 3 because the music was so loud we found it impossible to talk. My burgers was great! The fries were good and the peanuts were perfect. The melted cheese between two perfectly cooked patties was surrounded with crisp fresh lettuce; onion and tomato. The sauce and bun was perfect. Wish I had taken ear plugs or got my burger to go as I would love to give this burger place a 5 stars. Service was a tad slow and did I mention that the music was really really loud?,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,It's asking a lot of burger joints these days to offer a burger that actually tastes like beef but five guys does not fall in that category. Incredible flavor! Made to order makes a difference people. Everything about this burger is worth the hassle of airport security or five hour drive from Vegas. Can I get an amen for free toppings? I thought so. Cajun fries were to die for; I'm convinced they were sprinkled with heroin as even after I declared myself unable to get out of my chair without assistance I couldn't stop shoveling these fries. Note; the regular size is about the same size as the drink cups and enough for two (possibly 3) to share.   Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll definitely be back with an empty stomach and my elastic lined pants.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,friendly service. burgers are average. buns are terrible. very expensive,1
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,It did not look that great but sure tasted good. The burger was super juicy and the topping are awesome. I got everything on it and was surprised how well bell peppers went with a burger. Stay with the normal fries. I ordered the Cajun fries my second time and they were horrible.  It reminds me of an In and Out ripoff from the East coast for some reason. Not sure why.,0
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Amazing burgers and great service plus enough fries to feed an army! Sure; the price is a bit higher than most places but the only burgers in town that hold a candle to Five Guys are Culvers and Rumbi.,1
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,One of the Best Fast Food Burgers Around.   Im not typically a burger person.  However; occasionally I get a craving and Five Guys always hits the spot.  Five Guys is a chain burger restaurant but unlike any other.  The burgers at Five Guys are always fresh;hot; and juicy.  The burgers are tender; tasty; and well seasoned. In addition; to great burgers are Five Guys Fries.  Do not order a large order of fries.  The large of fries  is not large it is enormous; it is a lunch bag full of fries.  My nephew; sister and I barely made a dent in them.  Five Guys burgers are the closest you will come to burgers you cooked yourself.  Five guys allows you to  customize your burger with cheese; bacon; grilled onions; mushroons; and to many other toppings to name.   If customizing your burger isn't enough; you can do the same with your drinks.  Five Guys soda fountain  has every coke product from mello yello to dasani water. You select your base soda and and then add flavors  like cherry; peach; or lime.  So you can customize your drink as much as your burger.      Prices are reasonable; employees are friendly and accommodating;  and the service is quick.,1

8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Went to Five Guys for dinner. On our way there; I placed an order on my phone to speed up the process a bit. When we arrived; there were a few people in line. We walked over to the pickup counter and let them know we had placed an online order. They had the ticket and said our food would be ready soon. The guy handed us our cups and we went over to the Coca Cola Freestyle machines to get our drinks. I got the Peach Sprite. Love that combination! Went to use the restroom and then just a couple minutes later our food was ready. The online ordering probably saved us about 5 minutes. I had the Little Cheeseburger (1 patty... if you haven't been here; know that the Regular is 2 patties) with lite ketchup/mustard/pickles (sometimes they overdo the ketchup); and split a regular fry with my boyfriend; which was plenty because they fill up the cup and dump even more fries into the bag. Their fries are so good! Skins on; hot; and crisp on the outside yet soft on the inside. It's what I envision home cooked fries to be like. The burger also reminds me of something I'd want to make at home. The only thing I don't really like about Five Guys is how loud the music is... usually a mix of Classic Rock and Alternative. Also the burgers are $6+ so don't expect a cheap meal; but it'll be worth it!,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Had dinner at Five Guys this week. I ordered a Little Cheeseburger with ketchup; mustard; and pickles (and regular fries to share). Did not notice until the food came out; but the girl accidentally rang up lettuce instead of pickles. Brought it back up to the counter and they said they'd make me a new one. Got my correct burger and there was a lot of ketchup & mustard on it! Have they always put the condiments on both the top and bottom? I never noticed that before; but it was too much and I wiped some off with my napkin. Not my favorite visit; but it was OK.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,First time at Five Guys today on Litchfield Rd.  I was greeted properly by the young lady at the counter which is always a good start.  She asked me if I had eaten there and I told her it was my 1st time; and she politely helped me through the menu options.  Good service for sure.  The burger was delicious; nothing incredibly different; however Five Guys give you options for your toppings and they have them all it seems.  The fries were cooked well- but were too salty in my opinion.  Plus I ordered a large fry; and there were too many too eat!  Not like that's a bad thing; but a medium fry would probably suffice for two people here. Five Guys also has the new soda dispensary system where you can choose on a digital screen what you would like to drink.  I love these things mostly cause you can get any flavor mixed into your lemonade which is fantastic!  Lastly the price.  It wasn't inexpensive.  I paid about $12 for the meal; which for a burger and fries is kind of pricey.  I would return to Five Guys; but mostly for the burger which was the highlight of my meal.  Nothing out of the ordinary; but a solid lunch none the less and I enjoyed my first meal at Five Guys.,1

8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Met my wife there for lunch on a week day.  We got there right as they opened because they fill up pretty fast.  The music inside was way too loud.  Practically had to shout to have a conservation.  The burgers were ok; you could tell the meat was fresh.  If you like Wendy's burgers you'll like this place.  A bit pricey; over $20 for two burgers; one order of fries; (huge serving; feeds 2); and 2 sodas.  Again burgers aren't bad just not worth the price.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,8 people working here right now at 4:30 on a Friday; and one really nice tall black dude took my order and made my burger while everyone else was chatting. Give him a promotion and train everyone else again.  AMAZING burger by the way; but figure out what the staff is doing.,1
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,What is not to love.  An appetizer of peanuts for and then burgers that are fresh and full of good ingredients.  I always share the regular fry with a friend it's just too much for a single person. Love the soda machines!! I look forward to coming back again soon.  Always good service; definitely cannot complain... Prices for 2 to eat the single burger; share a fry; and a drink was $17.. Not cheap..but if you want quality products you're going to pay for it.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,This place was way overpriced for the food you get.  With the exception of the fries- they did give us a lot of fries; for a medium order. I found them dry; and strongly tasted of potato skin though.    My son ordered the bacon burger; there was no bacon; and the burger was small for the $6 it cost.  My daughter had the grilled cheese with some toppings; they left off the tomato (her favorite part).  Yes; I could have gone up and asked them to correct the order; but they were super busy and it took forever to get our food in the first place.   My husband got the blt.  Nothing special about it. I got the regular single patty burger; just ok.  My family and I agreed that we won't go back.  We actually prefer other fast food burger places that give you more for your money.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Mmmm burger + fries...  Am a fan of 5 Guys.  Simple menu; good burger; and it's cool how the fries come from potato farms from different regions of the US each week.  It's like I'm a connoisseur of fries.  You can also malt vinegar them!  Service is almost always friendly.  It can be hard to get a table and there is a line that often goes out the door if it's anywhere near lunch or dinner.  And not at all healthy.  Just uber yum.,1
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Love this place!  Like the one in Tempe; they also have the newer Coke machines which I LOVE! I was excited to see it since I was able to try it out when I was in Atlanta a couple of years ago; even before they were in any stores or restaurants.  It took me back to being in junior high making a drink with everything on the fountain.    My burger was just as ordered and my fries were fresh and crunchy.    They were friendly and the food came out very fast.,1
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Fresh yummy juicy burgers and crispy fries...  I ordered the small for burger and fries...  LOTs of food.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,I have heard many friends rave about Five Guys; so our family decided to give it a try one night.  Down to the nitty-gritty:  1. My son loved the peanuts.  I was happy they were available because we waited about 30 mins for our food....super sloooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww.  2.  Burger - not so great.  Okay.  LOVED the toppings and that they were included in the price.  Burger was only so-so.  Menu needs to clarify that if you want a single; order the small burger as the larger burgers are doubles.  3.  Fries - Five Guy's fries broke my husband's heart.  They showed such promise; coming out in a nice cup;; very similar to how fries (and poutines) come out at most chip stands in his home province.....and then one bite and you just knew -they were under cooked.  We each had 1 or 2 fries and then had to declare them D.O.A.    4.  Grilled cheese - loved that this option was available; but pretty steep cost for a bun turned inside out with a piece of american cheese.  I am giving 2 stars only because I have heard so much good about this restaurant since they came to Goodyear - but we won't be back.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Very good experience; burgers are good different experience when ordering but good. Fries are the BEST! All you can eat peanuts good as well. Fries better than in-n-out....,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,A lot better than In and Out burgers if you ask me. Gets a little expensive when your ordering for the whole family and adding drinks and fries to that; but totally worth it. Fresh lettuce and tomatoes; quality ingredients is what you're paying for. Plus I love all the different options when choosing your fountain drink.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,We've only grabbed it to go which in my opinion is the better option; you don't have a ton of space.    Burgers were delicious; definitely living up to the hype I've heard from others.  Price point isn't too bad and serving sizes are generous.  We have a family of 4 and split 2 orders of fries with plenty left over.  It will probably replace In and Out as our go to burger place near the house.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Walk into this place and you know right away its not your average fast food joint.  The peanut bags and shells are everywhere so if you are allergic to peanuts you definitely wouldn't be a fan here.  The serving sizes are not for those wanting to keep calories low.  We ordered the regular size burgers and they were enormous I couldn't even imagine getting their large ones.  The fries are my favorite; the peanut oil makes a huge difference with the taste although they are heavily salted so for me that is just heaven.  They have the new coke machines in here that have multitudes of sugared options ready to trigger the onset diabetes.  Yes folks clearly not a place to stay healthy but a good cheat for week.,0
8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Pricey; but the food is really good.  Order the cajun fries they are awesome.  The service was friendly; but the music was really; really loud.  So loud that you could not talk to the person at your table without yelling.  I would eat here again but would have to wait for the summer to be over to sit outside away from all the loud music.,1

8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,I don't review burger places.. unless if one of those times when I do. I have tried five guys one time; long ago.. and now I did it again. It wasn't my idea; but I did go along with it. 'Nuff excuses.  So I ordered a burger. No cheese; no bacon but with grilled onions. Apparently did my selective memory forget that a burger is a double burger. This makes it trickier to eat. Oh; yes it does.   Five Guys is an attempt to make fast food burger joint to be a little bit more than a fast food burger joint; without having anything special to back that claim up. Now the burgers here are fine. I do like them; but the cost-increase is not justified. I have heard some people truly rave about this place; but it is the same'ol; same'ol burger place that has developed since the 50'ies. The burgers are good; as they are in many other places. But it's only a burger.. not a magical burger; not a meal-o'meat extraordinaire - just a tasty burger. Nothing more.   Other good-tasting-burger-places you can have a good craft beer and a waitress fetching you all your wishes; but at five guys it is only the burger.. the rest is standard chain BS. I do believe they have better meat and condiments than the chain-burger-place; but then again.. I feel I have beaten this horse enough.   Good burger. Only. Nothing more. No beer. Sad face.   Need a tip? - Have a better burger at a place that serve beer.,0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Heard nice things about Five Guys and tried to go while I was in Portland but didn't make it. I found out about the new location in Surprise and paid a visit.    I went on a Saturday about 12:30 which was probably a mistake. The place was packed and it took about 25 minutes to get my order. You could hardly hear the numbers called because of the music and crowd noise.   The food tasted ok but is a bit messy to eat. It has good portions but I paid $13.13 for the bacon/ cheese burger with large fries; no drink; so it's a bit spendy. It's probably not a place I would go to again. In/out burger is quicker; cheaper and is not as messy to eat; so I'll stick with them in the future.,0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Even if you hate the food; you got to love the people who work there. They are the friendliest of any burger places in Surprise. I have never been rushed with my orders and their suggestions help quite a bit; too. My son's favorite is the double bacon cheeseburger and mine is the single cheeseburger with mushrooms. If you are going to order fries for 2-3 people; order the regular sized one. It's more than enough. I love the food; I love the staff; and I love the ever confusing soda fountain. 5+++ stars!,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Service is good. Staff were very nice. The wait was not long. But the prices are completely insane. No combos whatsoever. Every item you have to order separately.. 6.40 for a cheeseburger. I thought it would be a really huge cheeseburger for the price. It's not. Fries were good but also overpriced. Just blown away by dropping $20 for my son and I to have two cheeseburgers; 2 reg sodas and share a fry. Culvers is way better and half the price.,1

yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,I wasn't impressed with their burgers; they were ok but nothing special! However; the service and atmosphere were good for families with children,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,This was my first time at 5 guys.  After hearing how great it is;  I just had to try it.  Boy was I disappointed!  First off i had a bit of sticker shock at the prices. Don't mind paying for quality food but  $27.00 for 2 burgers;  2 drinks & 1 large fries is  a bit much . Okay maybe it is just that good...NOT! I ordered a bacon cheese double; the bun was stale & although the burger was just cooked it was not hot enough to melt the cheese. I ordered grilled onions & mushrooms; they were cold.  This would have been tolerable if the burger had any flavor.  Let's get to the fries; I love fresh cut fries with the skin when they are cooked properly; which these were not & did i mention all the salt. There was so much salt that my throat was burning;  would have been nice if they had used some of that salt on the meat.  The ac was cranked so low i almost needed a jacket;  this helped to make my fried get cold super fast.  The staff was courtious other then the guy behind the counter that thought it was karaoke  time and was not shy about singing to the music.  For another employee to start sweeping the floor while i was eating was also unacceptable.  I drove past 3 other burger places  to go here ; wish I would have stopped at another place. I gave 1 star only because I could not give a negative  number of them.,0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,If you are a burger lover this is your place; but prepare to spend a little bit more comparing to other fast food places. Have in mind that Five Guys is indeed a high quality juicy burgers and of course endless french fries with the skin. The only thing to consider in this location is the hours that people go to this place; what I mean is this place became so popular in the area that it can be full sometimes. My recommendation is visit it after 2:00pm or in the evening hours not late than 9:30pm. They have a great costumer service; is family friendly; and of course delicious.,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Service and staff was good . Food was ok at best . Unless you like greasy burgers then you will be ok .,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Everyone always says how amazing this place is across the country; so of course we had to try it out. The first one I went to was near Chicago; and it was okay. Then again; I don't really eat burgers (or fast food) all too often!  The Surprise location that just opened up; however; is not even comparable to the Chicago location we tried. My aunt really wanted to try it out; so we met her there during her lunch break and ordered some burgers and stuff. I don't remember it being that confusing to order before; but we were completely lost with all of the options/process and the people taking our orders were not very helpful. It was also extremely busy; but that was expected. However; some of the employees were extremely rude to other customers around us. They weren't rude to me personally; but I didn't like the way I saw a few of them speak to other customers. I thought I'd speak up for them; whether they realized it was happening or not! :P Some people are pretty oblivious; but employees shouldn't take advantage of that lol.  In my opinion; our orders were extremely simple. A few burgers and fries; nothing special about any of it. However; they took forever to get them out to us. The soda machines were pretty neat; but it was hectic trying to find the correct beverage with how busy the place was and the location of said soda machines. It was right in the way of the queue of people waiting for their orders; so it was also hard to tell who was waiting for what. It was also hard to hear which order numbers were being called; so I just stood right next to them waiting. I probably annoyed them; but oh well! Even then; I still could barely tell what order numbers they were calling out. I think they had a microphone to use; but they didn't seem to want to do that for some reason. (This is also one of the times I heard them being rude to other customers... this guy calling the numbers out called one customer's order two or three times; and the poor girls couldn't hear him. He finally got their attention and bitched at them for taking so long to get their order from him. I thought he was kidding with them at first; but the look on his face said otherwise.)  Overall; we weren't at all impressed with the price; the food (which was simply mediocre; nothing special); and service. Luckily I don't care about burgers because I'm not very American; but still... a disappointment for sure.,0

yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,One of the best burgers I've had in a while; when you go in there; the place is full of  Definitely orders the fries because you get a A LOT of them and they are hot n fresh,0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,We had a late night meal here after going to pick up a drunk from Nascar.   The Staff was more then excellent; man did those young guys have the customer service skill down. They asked all the right questions the register while ordering; offered to refill drinks for an elderly couple; cleaned and wiped tables for people. I was impressed.   The food was standard 5 guys; which is one reason to continue to go here. Quality and consistency.   While I think 5 guys is an average burger I gave the extra stars for the staff here.,1

yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Love that they offer the option of veggies on a bun and their awesome fries.  It would be even better if they offered a decent vegan burger (not processed). Fast; friendly service.  This location wasn't as busy as others I have been to.,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,"A overall disappointment! I always enjoy going to a place where they give out free peanuts; but normally the fun is throwing the shells all over. Here they give you the peanuts; and no real place to put the shells. Apparently; the floor is not expectable here. Also; the \build your own burger\"" theme is not original at all! In fact go to McDonald's and ask them to add or take off any topping to any burger and they will.....way to go you \""built your own burger.\"" I just saying that this can be done ANYWHERE.  Then I ordered the bacon burger with grilled onions. I ended up with no bacon and for some reason mushrooms. Once I advised them of the problem they were kind enough to give me some bacon that looked like it was cooked yesterday. The bacon was cold; old; dry; and all broken up. At that point I felt like they might as well just have given me bacon bits from a jar.   If I or anyone else is going to pay $11 for a drink; burger; and no fires; they should at least get the order right.""",0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,been here twice now; and the burgers are awesome.  i love the ability to build my own burgers on the phone APP at a stop light and then pick it up 15 minutes later.  the first time i went for some reason the order never got made but i only had to wait a few extra minutes and they got it for me (and the workers were VERY apologetic)   It;s close; good price; and good food; and i will keep going back,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Most amazing burgers ever. Kind of spendy but well worth it. The service is always top notch and they're incredibly friendly. The food quality is never poor; their choices are massive; and no matter what size fry you get; you'll have enough.,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,"Way over priced. The deal here is to fill you up on overloaded French Fry's. The bill for 2 burgers; 2 Frys; and 2 drinks was $28.00. Even eating in; they must treat it like take out because our order came in a brown bag. So we had no tray; basket; or plates. They put the burgers in the bottom of the bag and filled 6\ of French frys on top of it. Way more than any one person would want to eat. Each order of frys looked like the equivalent of 2 whole potatoes. The only good thing I could say was the burger by itself was very good. It was cooked just right. Juicy and flavorful. Still; the price can't be overlooked. $28.00 for 2 people is too much for a lunch of fast food""",0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Well; this is a franchise I have been meaning to try for a while! Ever since I lived in SoCal; I wanted to try Five Guys! I have always heard that they are very similar to our SoCal favorites like In-n-Out. Five Guys just opened a new franchise in Surprise! I have lived in Surprise for the last two years; and have not seen as many youngsters at one place than the night I ate at five guys! It was nice to see everyone there having a good time eating dinner! First! the only thing that is similar between Five Guys and In-n-Out was the atmosphere or the ambiance? (Trying to includes some tricky words today?) Burgers are totally different. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger w/ BBQ sauce; grilled onions. Burger was very good; my honey had the cheese burger; and we shared a large fries! Here is some tips! 1) We had way to much food; If you want one patty! Order the little burger. Their regular burgers come with two patties! 2) Wife and I could have shared an small order of fries; their larger fries is enough for four people.  Other than that we had a great time; nice trying something new; and really nice seeing a place where people can hang out and have fun.,0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,I've been to Five Guys twice; each time for lunch.  This first time; I chose the veggie burger.  Big mistake.  There was no burger.  Just their veggie toppings piled onto bun.  I wish there had been more information either on the menu or from the guy taking my order.  To be fair; I think it was his first day.  Good news; an order of fries is HUGE. Plan on sharing.  I ordered a regular hamburger on my second trip; and it was fine. Nothing to write home about; especially considering that I had heard a lot of comparisons to In & Out.  Overall; I might go back once in a while.,0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,The wait time is a little long but I guess that is expected from a made to order place. Other than that everything was delicious. I ordered the Bacon Burger with mayo; grilled mushrooms; and grilled onions. It was one of the best burgers I have had that wasn't from a steakhouse. I also loved their fries; the seasoning is on point.,0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,I think I might be the last person who knew about the Surprise location; but better late than never!   The place was stuffed to the brim on a Sunday night; you had to find a place to stand and according to the nice lady in line behind me; it's always like this :)  The burgers are fresh; better quality than most fast food restaurants; & yes; you get to pick your toppings;;;; but (don't hate me!!) I like In & Out burgers just a tad bit more. Both my daughter and I got the little burger; which is a single patty vs the 2 patties that come on the regular burger.   The CAJUN FRIES on the other hand are literally to die for! Best I've ever had; hands down! The portions are HUGE. 1 order could easily feed 4 normal people or 2 teenagers :D  They are also REALLY greasy; so I could not recommend you eat them on a daily basis; but if I want to splurge this is where I would do it.   The kids behind the counter were working at full speed (they must be EXHAUSTED when they get home!) & all seemed to genuinely enjoy their work. That always makes the experience better; especially since you're watching them cook up the orders...... there's no where else to look; lol.   Be prepared to take your meal to go; seating is limited. My daughter & I managed to snag a table; but I must say that I felt a tiny bit odd eating while a line full of people watched on (some circling the table) so they could get dibs as soon as we were done; lol. Oh well; now a larger population know that I'm a messy eater :),0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,GREAT burger and fries; wonderful customer service!!,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Good burger; fast service,1
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,"Whoa; whoa; whoa!!  Pay ATTENTION!  I'm pretty sure that was the best burger I've ever had!  The flavor was fantastic!    I had the \bacon cheeseburger\""; which comes as a double; (which is standard; you apparently have to order specifically to get one patty); with fried onions; mushrooms; lettuce and ketchup. OMG!    So juicy; so flavorful; and a really nice size; too. I didn't get any fries; but they looked good.   I noticed two interesting signs on the wall; one: \""Today's potatoes come from: ID; \""Tibbits Farm\""\""; and two: \""All our burgers are cooked Juicy and Well Done\"".   The restaurant looked nice; 50's style red & white; and very noisy; lots of hustle and bustle; especially with the order-fillers BELLOWING out the order numbers!    Fun place. My wife was not happy I tried it by myself; so we're going back; tonight!!""",0
yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,picked up burgers for the in laws after a horrible day at the surgery center. So; my review is based on the feedback from them; and our experience ordering. Mr C and I have not personally tried the burgers yet; but we will.   Monday night; around 7:15 PM. The place is packed. Yes; its noisy and has hard rock music playing; loudly.  Good thing we knew ahead of time that the folks wanted the 'little' burgers; otherwise we would have ordered them a regular.. which is huge. Also; we started to order large fries; but the gal at counter said; you may only want the regular; which is enough for 2-2.5 people.  So; for $13 bucks; we ordered a little cheeseburger; and a little hamburger and specified what we wanted on them and a regular french fry.   We stood and watched as the 10+ orders ahead of ours were prepared; and it was a pretty smooth operation. The burgers are fried on a flat top grill; and the toppings looked of good quality and liberal.   Oh.. lots of peanuts to be had; so if you have a severe peanut allergy; you will want to avoid this place.   I picked up dad next morning for his post op appointment and he was quick to say how good the burgers and fries were.    So; Mr C & I will give this place a try one of these days and then Ill update my review from my perspective on the burger.,0
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Found this Chipotle after the one on Baseline and Val Vista ticked me off for the last time. The workers here are extremely friendly and got my three burrito order cooked in done in under 5 minutes!,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Fast; friendly service and the same high quality ingredients you'll find at any Chipotle. We were here on a limited time schedule for lunch; and we were in and out with plenty of time to spare!,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Love this place best service ever. Didn't know I could get a side order of tortillas until the other day. Now I do it all the time.,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Love this place best service ever. Didn't know I could get a side order of tortillas until the other day. Now I do it all the time.,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,I will eat at this Chipotle any day of the week. The service wad awesome. We came in late last night and they made us fresh steak and chicken and they were happy to serve us. Not like the one in downtown Phoenix,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,By far; the friendliest Chipotle I've been to. Awesome staff; above and beyond service. Thank you guys for being so awesome here!,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Food and service was excellent! First time here and as I was deciding the worker never made me feel rushed. He welcomed the guest behind me as I continued to choose between beans or no beans. After he was finished with me; he instantly gave them the save positive attitude he gave me and apologized for the delay in assistance. Great service; great food; great price! COME TO HAWAII!,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Stopped in last night for dinner....around 7ish...so a little busy; not crazy; but steady.  We ordered a chicken bowl and burrito....  He told us it would be about 6 minutes for chicken...so he asked us just to go to the front of the line for a couple pops and they'd let us know...  So we took our free pops and had a seat....sure enough about 6 minutes later a gal came out and flagged us over.  I appreciated that the guy gave us a time frame and also didn't try to talk us into another meat option.  The free pops were also appreciated.  We will be back; thank you Chipotle!!,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Very great customer service;  Amazing food;  Wonderful design layout;  Everthing 100% recycle; Extra condiments;  Acholic drinks served.  Wonderful place for a good time.  Please consider this meixcan dine in for your next visit for food.,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,I eat at this location nearly every day and the other comments here about the friendliness of the staff are spot on. They are both having fun and providing excellent service. It really does make a difference!  I found chipotle after discovering I have a gluten sensitivity. I find that I have no bad reaction to the food here even without asking for glove or utensil changes. Nothing on the menu except flour tortillas is off limits    If you are celiac you may consider asking for allergy precautions of course. Also; other locations may no be as good as this one about such issues.  The chipotle chain like any other has weaker and stronger locations. This chipotle is absolutely tops in my book.,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Update:  Well; I still go to this location almost every day; you guys know who I am :).  I understand that places go through ups and downs; at this very moment; this location is not at its best.  Rushing on the service line has lead to some messiness -- I saw one associate put a piece of chicken that had fallen on the counter back into someones bowl.  Another time; a different associate was talking while flinging guac on a bowl and proceeded to get it all over that bowl; the counter; and the outside of my bowl that was in line behind... yuck!  The quality of the food on the line especially at opening time is spotty -- some meats are cold; no fajita veggies; sad; dry looking sofritas.  I get the impression that they don't really try anymore to be ready to serve the best food right at 11am.  I have seen some faces change; including managers; and I assume that these personnel changes are the root of the problems.  All this said; Chipotle is still miles better than most fast food in my book; and the staff here on the whole is still provides friendly service.  I hope someone reads this and tries to get back that total excellence this location had mastered in the past.,0
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,If you haven't been to a chipotle you should. And if you're looking for a good one try this one! The staff has always been top notch and the food prepared exactly to specs. The times I have put in online orders they were always on time and the one time that it wasn't they gave me a free drink while I waited! The manager and employees all seem to enjoy their work and that always shows in a meal. Nothing but good things to say about this place!,1
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,This has always been my goto Chipotle and great until recently my online orders were getting messed up. Missing tortillas on the side and guac. Not sure if there has been management changes or something but also  a lot less chips are being given in the bag. $1.30 for 25 chips? Might as well go to the store and buy a whole bag of Tostitos instead. Disappointed in recent experiences here when i order at least once a week :(,0
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Let me preface this review by telling you; I'm the biggest Chipotle fan there is.  I visit them whenever and wherever I can.  I love it so much that I've been a long-time (small) shareholder of CMG stock.  So it pains me to say that I'm not sure what the deal is with this Chipotle; but the staff here just seems a bit off compared to other locations.  First; nearly every other CMG I've been to around the country takes great pride in cleanliness.  On my last few visits to this one I've had to wipe my own table clean on more than one occasion.    Second; they just do not seem well-trained.  My wife made the mistake of ordering a margarita one night and the guy working had to scrounge around for the materials and even ask a co-worker how to make the drink.  Another example; yesterday; my son ordered a cheese quesadilla and the crew basically forgot about it and what resulted was an overcooked crunchy slab of goo.    Lastly; their speed lacks a sense of urgency you find at the other stores.  Again; on yesterday's visit; the guy working who was our first point of contact..you know the guy that grabs the tortillas or bowls based on your order?  Well; he had to change out the bean containers with fresh beans.  This process caused a huge bottleneck because none of his co-workers down the line from him felt the need to jump in and help him either with the beans or with getting us started.  What was a relatively short line of maybe 6 people quickly grew to one reaching the door for no good reason.     I would hope Mr. Ells makes a visit to check-in on this location and somehow rights the ship.  Until I hear different; I'll stay away from this store and go to the one at Power/Ray or Val Vista/Baseline.,0
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,"Used to love this location.  Not anymore.  Two new faces recently joined the familiar; pleasant employees and it hasn't been a change for the better.   On a recent visit I was ordering two bowls. They began one and then in order to catch up on a phone in order that was seemingly overlooked by the girl peering slyly over the cook station; the male who must be seeking brownie points with said coquette; shoved this order in between my two bowls.   In an attempt to let him know that my other bowl would not be ready when I reached the register I said \That bowl back there is also my bowl\"" indicating the bowl that was now third in line.  He said in a nasty dismissive tone \""I GOT this! \""   The next person in the prep line then asked me what I wanted on the NEXT bowl; which of course was not mine.  I replied \""That isn't my bowl...THAT is my bowl\"" pointing back 3 places in the lineup.    Again the arrogant guy said in his nasty way \""WE GOT THIS!\""  I shrugged and stood there.    He barked out the toppings order on the to go's order and closed them up.   While I stood there unable to finish my order or to pay.  Eventually they had all four bowl sealed up and the register lady said \""These are your bowls?\""  Indicating the bowls sitting on the counter still as arrogant guy had begun bagging the other two.  I said \""I don't believe so\""   The arrogant whips around and says \""Yes; they are\""  And I said \""Then what are those?\""  Indicating two sides of liquid sitting on top of the bowls.  He says \""That's your salad dressing\""  I said \""Great; but I didn't order a salad\"".    No apology; no nothing he just grabbed the two dressings and put them in the correct bag for the lady who had been waiting for her order.    Once he removed himself from the line up the rest of my order went well...excepting for the fact that he seemed to find it necessary to turn his back to me and to whisper his accounting of events to two very uncomfortable looking employees (they were embarrassed that he was talking smack about me but he must be the supervisor so all they could do was shift nervously and keep their mouths shut.    The little honey the male seemed so eager to placate stared out from behind the prep counter with a smug expression.  Man do they have trouble brewing at this location with this damsel and her gallant knight.""",0
DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Perfect spot for a filling lunch. Its quick easy and not to mention the food is fantastic. I rarely meet people that dislike Chipotle and if I do I assume they're crazy. The service is fast and the workers are really friendly. Definitely one of my favorites for a lunch on a tight schedule.,1
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,Great chicken as usual! I was in town for a conference down the road at the mayo clinic so I stopped by for a quick bite. Gluten free options are their specialty! I ordered a meal of grilled nuggets; fries and seltzer (seltzer was free). Quick service and the food was delicious!,1

zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,Love this place. Wish it was open 7 days a week but it's not. Chicken sandwich is the bomb and their fries are way better than McDonald's! Fast service through drive through. They could give out more sauces when asked for them through the drive through; only got 1 of each sauce which was disapointing but nothing big since my meal was small. Portions are very filling.,0
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,"Excellent food & service- Chicken is so fresh & the workers there really show that they love their job.   I was there last night & the night manager \Kenny\"" a younger guy brought out our food & was checking on us to see if we needed anything- He had a spark in his eye & said he would own a chik-fil-a himself one day....now thats what i like to see in my employees!!!""",1
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,Service INSIDE can be slow sometimes; since they seem to worship the drive-thru customers and get all of their orders first; or at least with significant priority.  Staff is polite.  It's a real PITA to have to get refills from them though; instead of having the soda dispensers out for self-serve.  Are they really saving much money by doing this?  When there are lines of people to order; it's a bit much to butt in line to ask for a refill... or maybe that's the point.,1

zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,I'm a relatively new fan to Chick-Fil-A. Those breakfast chicken minis and chicken nuggets are SO damn good that I've had to adopt Chick-Fil-A into my workweek lunch routine.   This particular location is relatively new and deluxe for a fast food joint. The people who work there are very courteous; which at first was a little offputting because I felt like I was getting too much service for a fast food place. Something that I really like about Chick-Fil-A is that they have a fun condiment bar. It's not just ketchup; straws and napkins. They keep a couple types of mayo and mustard packets up there; as well as Purell handwipes (way cool); and even plastic placemats for children--which brings me to my one gripe.   The place is teeming with children. Screaming children. And lots of them. When I was there last week; I couldn't wait to leave the place because it was so loud and the children were so annoying. Luckily there is an area off to the side where you can sit away from the play place; but that's assuming that nobody with kids sits over there. Word to the wise; if you don't like being around babies and kids; go through the drive thru.,0
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,Food is what you'd expect it to be.   What is even better is the service here.   The manager that runs the place knows how to get good workers.  It just wish that they'd be more open minded on the politics.,1
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,This Chick-Fil-A rocks my socks off!! That sounds like a bit of an overstatement; doesn't it? Well; it's not. We have been here several times for lunch and the line is LONG. The first time I approached I was so disappointed at the length of the line and almost opted to leave however we were in and out in 10 minutes! The had two people taking orders with iPads; took payment while you waited in line (cash register set up by the area where you would normally order); and all you had to do was pull up and grab your food. I've never had anything come wrong; they give plenty of sauces; and are always super friendly. In fact; if I'm having a bad day I might just come here just because I'm pretty sure the staff here would cheer me up with their great attitudes. That; my friends; is rare these days but this Chick-Fil-A delivers every time!,1
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,LOVE LOVE LOVE the food; I'm sad to give a bad review.  But; the last 4 times; they screwed up our order in the drive through.  I'm sad...I love the food; but they just can't seem to get it right. :(,0
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,"I had only been going to Chick Fil A over the past few years for a chicken sandwich; lunch or dinner. I'm hooked on the chicken minis on the breakfast menu. Just the right balance between the bread and the chicken. Drenching it in honey makes it more awesome.  This place is what customer service is all about. I always try to thank every employee when they provide prompt; courteous service. Love the \Cathy-ism\"" when they respond \""my pleasure.\""""",1
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,I have been hooked on Chick Fil A ever since I had my first taste of a chicken nugget sample at a long forgotten mall food court.  So; when I moved to AZ I was concerned that I would not be able to get my fix - what if there were no locations nearby?  Lucky me; this location in the Scottsdale 101 center can take care of my chicken sandwich and waffle fry cravings.  Well; except for Sundays; when all CFA locations are closed.  This location is nice and clean; and service is efficient both in the restaurant and at the drive through - my orders have always been correct which is nice.  They aren't stingy with the condiments; either.  Want to try more than one type of sauce?  No problem!  Not like some other fast food places I won't name where customers are asked exactly how many catchup packets are needed.  Seriously?   I usually stick with the basic Chick Fil A Chicken Sandwich and waffle fries.  If I am feeling a little wild & crazy I will ask for lettuce & provolone cheese as well (tasty!).  If I want to pretend I am being healthy; I will get the Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich; which is not breaded and is served on a wheat bun with lettuce & tomato.  Either option is tender and juicy.  I have tried a couple of the breakfast items as well - the chicken minis (little chicken nuggets served in a slightly sweet mini bun) and the chicken biscuit sandwich are both good; as are the hash browns (quarter-sized tater tots - yum!),1

zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,This location rocks.  My wife and I go in a couple times a month for lunch during week.  Even when the place is packed they still give awesome service and food.  While enjoying lunch a gentleman who worked there asked to refill our drinks and take away garbage.  Doesn't matter how busy it may look its always worth the wait.,1
zht8__JJoxkozBhf_vuKYg,"Who doesn't love their nuggets!  I love Chick Fil A nuggets.  I usually go get a quick order during lunch. It's faster to go inside than the drive through.  The staff is always friendly and says \Hi\"" or \""Welcome\"".  The dining area is always clean and always full during lunchtime.""",1
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,I can't believe I'm having to write this review as most of my encounters at this location have been nothing but pleasant.  Well not today!  I come in around 2pm to pick up a late lunch for myself and a co-worker.  Line is fine; no issues there.  I order a burrito bowl to go with white rice and black beans.  I know the drill.  Then I get to the barbacoa.  It's the bottom of the barrel only the fatty pieces left; so I say you know what; I'd rather wait for the next batch.  She looks at me like I'm crazy.  She's like what do you mean.  Again; I'm like I'd rather wait for the next batch than get what's left.  Now here's what pissed me off.  She turns around and laughs and says something to the other dude in Spanish. Oh no she didn't.   I should have left right then and there and I wish I had.    Look; they're going to have to bring out a fresh batch for the next person anyway and I said I'm fine waiting.  I don't get what the big deal was.  Haven't any of you ever gone to a pizza place; saw the last dry slice all by itself and said you'd wait for a fresh pie?  So then she calls me over with some dry pieces that they brought from the back in a new bowl.  Seriously?  I'm not dumb chic.  I'll wait for the next batch.  As I'm waiting a couple minutes later another guy walks up and says the same thing and she's like; no problem it'll just be a couple minutes.  Oh really?  I see how this goes.  I mean; come on.  How hard was that?  Like I said I've been here before; made small talk; joked around with the other staff and walked out with a smile.  It's the end of an era 7th Ave and McD because I won't be going back in there again.,0
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,Chipotle is one of those places that you know what you're going to get and are familiar with the product. I don't get the hype around this place. It's mediocre Mexican food at best; and mediocre service. I rarely see a sense of urgency with the employees. It's definitely a corporate fast food chain.,0
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,we've never had a bad experience at this location. The food is always good and the service is good also. We will return.,1
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,Soooo salty! The workers are quick to make assumptions about what you say you want and I have had them make me a few orders with something I didn't want it it. Slow down; listen; and go easy on the salt! (& leave the sass at home).,0
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,Despite the raw meat picture I just saw for the first time.......... I love this Chipotle!! I never order meat so that's never a concern really..  The veggie burro I get every time never disappoints! The staff has been fun and friendly lately and I love it. CHIPOTLE IS MY LIFEEE. lol,1
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,"It pains me to write anything negative about Chipotle; but my experience at this location was less than amazing. I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and the place was nearly empty. I found that a little strange; but didn't think much of it.  As I stood waiting for my turn to order; I watched the girl make a burrito for the person in front of me. Granted; Chipotle burritos are always pretty huge; but this thing was a monster. I don't think the girl making it knew when to stop or how cut down on everything else slightly so that the whole thing could be rolled up. She ended up getting guacamole all over the outside of the guy's burrito and also had to use two pieces of foil to cover it up.   When my turn was up; I had to tell the girl twice that I wanted a burrito (she just stared at me the first time like I was slow). Once we got started; I continued to have to repeat myself. I don't think I was talking particularly quietly; nor was I speaking un-clearly. I also don't think she was hard of hearing. The entire time she had this bored; \let's get on with it\"" look on her face. A couple of times she almost put some things I didn't want into my burrito and when corrected would drop the stuff back into the containers with somewhat of an attitude. She managed to make my burrito normal size; I'm happy to say.  I was \""helped\"" at the register by another employee. When I say helped; I mean a zombie blankly stared at me; stated the amount; took my card; and promptly turned around to talk to his co-worker when the transaction was done. No smile or even a \""thank you\"".  I ate at a counter seat by the window; looking out onto 7th Ave; which was the most pleasant part of the visit. It is a nice area. People walking around or riding bikes; interesting shops and restaurants; nice landscaping; etc.  The food itself was lackluster. Someone there needs to learn how to cook brown rice properly. It was somewhat hard and not very tasty; a problem I have never encountered at any other Chipotle location. Considering that about half the burrito ended up being rice; I had to force myself to finish my meal. I'm hoping maybe someone was just having an off-day in the kitchen. If their rice is like this all the time; it is safe to say I won't be back.  Love Chipotle; just not this one. I might try it again sometime when the memory of their terrible rice has faded.""",0
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,I eat at Chipotle often. 3-5 times a week due to my busy schedule i find chipotle to be on the healthier side of fast food. At this particular one the service is horrible. They are super stingy when it comes to meat and ingridients. I have to ask them to put more chicken or more steak everytime. I dont except to pay 10 dollars for a bowl of rice and beans.,0
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,"Wow I never thought I could write a bad review about Chipotle... but here goes.   So Chipotle food is Chipotle food.... all the same; never tastes different; you cant screw it up; and they didn't. My food was as yummy as any other time I ate it.   The service on the other hand was apawling. (and its not that this is the first time; the second at least at this location)  So I walk into this Chipotle after kicking my own ass at the gym; thinking its 2pm shouldn't be busy; but wrong I was; there was a line of about 16-18 people; I think meh cant take that long; plus I was starving and wasn't going to leave without my burrito bowl. I quickly realize this line ain't goin anywhere fast. I look around and see what the employees are doing to expedite this process; nothing! The poor guys trying to make the food as quickly as possible; just weren't cutting it; the girl at the register stood their with her hand on her hip just waiting for something to happen; THEN the kicker. I notice TWO; yes two; managers just sitting down to enjoy their tacos; all the while their employees are drowning behind the line and the line keeps growing. No care in the world. It took everything in me not to scream across the restaurant; \Hey are you two enjoying your lunch? Cuz we aren't... how bout help out your employees?\"" Ugh! So frustrated.   As I left; 20 minutes later; with my burritos to go now since they took forever; I could only shake my head as I walked by their table; still enjoying they food.   And to make matters even worse... I walk down their hall way to see water running out the kitchen door down the hall way. I do an about-face and walk up to the manager to inform him of the issue; before I could even get the words out of my mouth he says \""The water? yeah I know\"" I gave him a \""Are you f------ serious?!\"" look; and left. Wow he already knew about the leak and was still doing nothing.   I should have walked my happy ass right down the hall way and thrown myself on the floor and yelled for help... maybe I could be the new owner and straighten some shit out in there.""",0
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,They need a new crew at the location immediately. The food is so horrible my kid wouldn't eat it; bc it had no flavor. Everything is always bland and the line has crumbs littered everywhere. This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to in my life. I'm a regular so I know bad chipotle when I see one. They don't pay attention to your request; so you have to repeat you order over and over. That's the third time this has happened in a month. I'm done personally; save your time and avoid this location. Drive to the camelback location or go downtown. Trust me!,0
X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,"When my kidnappers finally dropped me off in an alley; I cut off the rope and removed the duct tape from my mouth.  The afternoon sun dried my tears and my belly thought my throat had been cut.  It was not.  I was famished.  I mean; I could have eaten an ox; an elephant; a scabby dog; and a horse between two vans.  My captors took my wallet with identification; my keys; and my belt.  All I had on me was a ten dollar bill.  There is only one place that would accept me in this condition and feed me enough food for my survival.  It is time to man up and get in line at the Chipotle.  When I entered the restaurant;  the air conditioning was an immediate relief.  For the last few days; my only form of air conditioning was a Popsicle being waved in my face.  And then I heard music coming out of plywood walls.  The corrugated steel and concrete made me have flashbacks of my echoing warehouse prison I was detained in.  I had to stay brave and line up with the people that have not read any books about \Communist Russia\"" or \""The Grapes of Wrath\"".  We were all hungry; and evidently; we all forgot our wallets and purses and were forced to eat here with our ten dollar bills.  All of the employees were pissed off that they had to serve people food while wearing the same t-shirt for an entire week.  The air was permeated with beefgrease; and I imagine that odor clings to fabric.  It would be nice if companies that require dress codes gave their employees enough clothing for a week and not just one shirt... but then again; it would be nice if my pants were not falling off while I was trying to decide if I wanted three sloppy tacos or a drippy burrito.    I went with the drippy burrito; in order to not actually see what was going into my peckish gape.  The first thing the employees are eager to give you; is rice.  They will pile it on.  One heaping spoon was too much; but then she slapped on another small spoon too and smiled at me.  She was nice; and I was too hungry to tell her that she was taking up space for the real stuff.  I wasn't in a position to make a scene; although; in retrospect; everyone was already looking at me.  I was shuffling like a penguin down the assembly line because my ankles were still handcuffed together.  Jokes on them; I pawned those bad boys and got about as much as I paid for the Chipotle rice-filled burrito.  When I finally got a bite of beef; it was savored.  Not because it was prepared in a marinade and cooked to a mouth-watering perfection.  Because it had a piece of tough ligament or rubbery fat still attached.  Whatever.  I was hungry; and just spent the previous eight hours hogtied in the trunk of a car.  Don't judge.  It is really hard for someone to mess up a burrito that you tell them how to make.  I feel privileged enough now to write reviews on Yelp about all of the amazing artisans; small businesses; and kitchens that help make Phoenix a vibrant place to live and eat.  Mexican food is as diverse as the people and landscape that the food comes from.  When companies act as the face of an entire cultural experience in the exact same way all over the world; negative stereotypes are formed about Mexican food.  Chipotle; a company that brands itself  as a Mexican eatery is more representative of flavors and products that can be eaten in a Taco Bell than eating from an eatery in Hermosillo or Nogales.  Unfortunately; every corner in Phoenix is being taken up by cookie-cutter prefab restaurants that replace genuine opportunities for families and bootstrap DIYers to make something out of our unique life experience while providing healthier; fresh; and local products.  I was once kidnapped.  It was that day that I learned my city was hijacked.  Eat at Tacos De Jaurez on 7th St and Portland or La Condessa on 16th St just north of McDowell instead of Chipotle for better food in a more relaxed and comfortable community atmosphere for about the same pricepoint.""",0
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,Being a northern Cali guy. You know it's not going to be what you think from the old town. I ordered the # 9...OK CA you know the # 9 . I hate to scale weight; I'm paying  $ 8.00 for a foot long; bring on the meat. The staff were great. put up with my old story's of the original story me and my wife went too.  Problem: bad location; had to look to find in a strip mall.  But still good place to get a sandwich.,1
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,"I was introduced to Togo's by my boyfriend; orginially from California. I love sandwiches so of course; I was excited to try a new place. It's about a 10 minute drive from his house (about 20 minutes from mine) so we decide to head over from his place on a sunday afternoon. To my delight; it just happens to be my favorite sandwich as the daily special (turkey and avocado). How awesome!! We decide to order two sandwiches each; one for now and then one for later since the prices are great for the daily special. The sourdough bread is great but a little hard to eat so if you're looking for a softer bread; I'd go with the parmesean. Similar to subway; you are able to add your own toppings but cheese is extra. Sandwiches are stuffed full of goodies and just thinking about it makes me want to eat one now!!  The only negative (for me at least) is that it seems to take a long time for them to make the sandwiches. So; if you're in a hurry; I'd call ahead to order or just plan to be there a little while. My boyfriend and I now dub \Togos\"" as our sunday afternoon treat spot and have been several times since it opened. Staff is extremely friendly and the place is spotless. Totally love and will keep coming back!!""",1
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,"TOGO's is about as good as it gets for a \franchise\"" sandwich; and this location in particular is the best one I've ever been to. It's huge; well-run; with very friendly service; fast when busy; and consistent in quality & quantity. About a million times better than Subway; and a far better value as you actually get a reasonable amount of meat in your sandwich; unlike the other guys; where you get about a metric ton of lettuce and other fluff ingredients; hiding some wafer-thin slices of generic grocery case cold cuts. Give it a try if you've never been; you won't be disappointed.""",1
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,Delicious sandwiches; had to take off a star for service. The person making my sandwich kept messing up; but other than that great quality sandwiches.,0
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,Togos has the best sandwiches ever but the employees at this location act like they hate their job. The energy level was in the tank- no smiles and super slow service.,0
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,I have been a Togos fan for many years and when they disappeared from the valley I was very disappointed.  So when I found they were opening around the corner from my house you could well image my delight.  When we first walked into the new one I was a little worried because I remember the decor of my previous visits to the old shops being much more lunch counter and this one was more like the run of the mill fast food style. I recalled one of my favorite sandwiches was a cucumber and avocado but did not snow it on the menu but when I asked they said I could order off menu.  The sandwich was good - a lot less ingredients than they used to serve but it was still delicious.,0
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,I found this location by accident one day when leaving my satellite office and dreading having to order another sandwich from the napkin tyrants at a competitor. I had seen advertisements for Togo's; but had never tried them; so I gave it a shot. What a difference! Great food; napkins a-plenty; friendly staff.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they still seem a little overwhelmed during the busy times; but my orders (whether hot or cold) have always been right (and good).,1
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,This is the second time I have left disappointed here. The first is when they just opened. I will let that one go....   My boyfriend ordered first and this is where the problems started. He ordered the meatball sub.  The girl making the sandwich asked what type of bread he wanted (sourdough) and  confirmed he wanted provolone cheese then started throwing on the meatballs. The thing is; sourdough doesn't taste very good when cold and the warm meatballs were on top of cold cheese... She didn't even offer to toast the sandwich that is typically served hot! When he asked her to toast the sandwich to be toasted after she had made it; it was apparently an inconvenience to her and she just made a mess and STILL gave it to us.  When I ordered my sand which she was already over it; apparently. If I asked a question; I got a one word response.... I also wanted my sand which toasted; but again wasn't offered. I just dealt with the gross cold sourdough.... There are better options in the area... doubt i will be returning.,0
T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town; but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.    ToGo's origins are NorCal; with a huge following there.  Here; they've met with mixed results so far; closing some locations including one in Scottsdale.   Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling; with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there; but this one is much larger.   My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.  The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub; or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL  There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink; see photo.   So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I had my first experience with Raising Cane's today.  I got the Three Finger Meal and; for fast food; it was pretty good.  The breeding on the chicken was not overdone and; although not very seasoned; tasted pretty good.  They serve crinkle cut fries here; which I'm not usually a fan of but were actually decent.  The meal also came with Texas toast which basically was like a grilled half of a hot dog bun.  It was ok; if a bit of a gimmick.  The meal stood fine on its own without the extra carbs of the bread.  Lastly; the fresh squeezed lemonade was good.  Not overly sweet.    I guess the thing I liked best was the atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.  The location I ate at is pretty new so they may still be in the honeymoon stage; but I'd definitely return should I get a craving for chicken fingers again.,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"I  am really sad to have to write this review.  Six months ago I would have given them 5 stars and raved about the food but over the last few months something has changed here.  I don't know if management has changed or who orders the food but we were disappointed in early February by the skimpy chicken; the limp fries and loss of flavor in the coleslaw.  Could have been a bad day; right?  So we went back a couple of weeks ago.  Same thing.  The size of the chicken fingers has drastically been reduced and even the bread is lacking.  It was \shrunken\"" and limp.  I really hope Raising Cane's will come back to the food we were raving about six months ago.""",0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,If a fast-food restaurant only serves chicken fingers; I would have thought that it would serve the greatest fast-food chicken fingers I have ever consumed.  I thought wrong.  Very wrong.  The food that I ate left me pondering the mystery of how Raising Cane's has such a hardcore fan base.  I tried the 3 finger combo.  3 chicken fingers; fries; a slice of texas toast and a drink.    I'll start with the good. The texas toast. It's a massive piece of fluffy white bread covered in butter.  The bread is so soft that it could be used comfortably as a pillow.  But; I wouldn't recommend that because you could choke to death by accidentally eating said delicious texas toast pillow in your sleep.  The bad. Everything else in the box. I appreciate that the chicken wasn't greasy; but it certainly wasn't crispy.  The actual meat was dry and the breading was severely under seasoned.  And whatever that Cane's sauce is supposed be; it's disgusting.  It's some sort of a barbecue sauce and ranch dressing mixture that tastes like an unidentifiable somewhat smokey; somewhat spicy; creamy mix of blandness.  It really doesn't say much when the specialty (and only) sauce a restaurant serves makes its underwhelming main dish taste even worse.  Or maybe that says a lot.  The fries were just standard.  Considering chicken fingers are all that's on the menu; I don't see any reason why I would return to this or any other Raising Cane's.  If for some bizarre reason I end up eating at a Raising Cane's again; I'll just order 10 slices of texas toast and call it a day.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"I would say these are the best chicken fingers I've ever eaten. They were tender and just enough coating. The \secret\"" sauce had a little kick and was awesome.  The menu is simple so it doesn't take forever to decide what to order and the price is very reasonable.  My husband loves sweet tea and theirs tastes just like what you get in the South.""",0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"Possibly the first AND last time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered \The Box Combo\"" which included 4 chicken strips; cole slaw; fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it would be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods; I pulled over; parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............  Chicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them without burning your mouth.  Even after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes; my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit \""off\"".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain jane.  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any flavor.  The dipping sauce helped; but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips looked good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and unfortunately I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!  Fries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.  Cole Slaw- Didn't try it.  Texas Toast-  This was the best part of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice; I would have done it.  Soda- Coke Zero tasted a little \""off\"".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.  Sauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.  Service in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh; right?  We shall see................""",1

JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Finally made it in to try this place; resisting In-N-Out across the street.  I went with Chicken Fingers; a cuplet of Cane's Sauce and Fries.  The menu is dinky here...  What I ordered is almost all they have except buns; soft drinks & cole slaw.  With that said; I found this place to be friendly; comfortable; inexpensive; & the food was REALLY GOOD!     :-))  Chicken Fingers 2 x $1.09; Cane's Sauce 29¢; Fries $1.59=$4.06,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,For a while I saw this place being built and finally it opened.  I was excited to finally try it; but I went a while before I actually did.  Im a huge fan of anything chicken and I guess I thought this was a wing place before seeing that it was literally all chicken fingers.  Ok; no problem.  The food is good.. but nothing blew me away.  I ordered their 4 chicken finger meal; which I guess is very popular.  It came with a side of fries; a piece of garlic bread and some slaw.  My favorite coleslaw is still the one from KFC.  The bread was soft and tasty and the chicken was ok.  The sauce they gave you to dip it in helped.  So it was good.  Would I go back? Sure; but it wouldn't be my first choice.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"I was excited to try the chicken fingers as I had been craving some all day. This was my first time here so I didn't really know what the menu was. Actually thought that the streamlined menu was good. I figured since the menu was simple that everything would be very good. I ordered two \Box\"" combos. The chicken tenders were tender but had no flavor. How can your signature item be bland. The Texas toast also had no butter or garlic flavor and was barely toasted. The fries were just basic small crinkle cut fries but did not hold any salt on them. The cole slaw was ok but not great. The best part of the meal was the sauce but I really wasn't expecting to have to drown the chicken tenders in sauce to give them flavor.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed.""",0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I love that I can order honey mustard bc Cane's sauce is overrated.    The chicken is amazing though.  I am not a fan of chicken fingers usually but when I'm in this area I'm always happy to stop in.  Juicy; fresh chicken with delicious coleslaw; toast & fries this place is great.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Food is awesome. Service is good. Watch the overspray when they are cleaning tables around you. Just a little too happy with the spray bottle.,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Food isn't that good. Don't know why people love it so much. The customer service is okay but they are quite and don't really talk. My favorite thing is the ice tea wow it's amazing! But other then that it's cool. An upgraded KFC with not  a lot of stuff on the menu.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"Some of my black friends recommended this place to me (true story; my black friends love chicken); so it's been on my list of \places to check out\"" for a few months.  Did the drive through thing; got the chicken strip sandwich / fries / lemonade combo.  The chicken strips were moist and crispy; quite tasty.  The Cane sauce had good flavor; but since they wanted to charge me an additional 35 cents for sauce; the sandwich was kind of dry (just chicken; sauce; lettuce & bun).  The fries were crinkle cut; and soggy.  The \""fresh squeezed\"" lemonade tasted like Country Time and the service was less than personable or stellar.  So; if you are JUST going to get some tasty chicken; this place is nice and at least they don't hate gay people.  Outside of that; nothing you need to check out.""",0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,If you are reading about Raising Cane's; chances are that you have been here already; or know they are known for their amazingly fresh and crispy delicious chicken tenders and secret Cane's sauce.  This review is for those who think fries and a tasty slice of Texas toast is too much to handle with your tenders.  Every time i get gas at QT i hit the drive thru and order just 3 tenders and 1 Cane's sauce; and it satisfies.  Update: got soggy strips last time; they said my next meal was on them; they replaced the strips but charged me for the sauces because they said I didn't claim there was anything wrong with them previously; past couple times I came; I was nickel and dimed for an ice water in the drive thru.

JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"First of all it's right next to the freeway so it's hard to even turn in. Then you get there and there's limited parking cause it's soooo busy. Your options to order are Chicken fingers; chicken fingers and chicken fingers.(I understand it's a finger joint but lets have some other options) I order and the food comes out quick. The fingers aren't  even crispy and the sauce is some weird Thousand Island/Ranch/Peppercorn.Then the fingers are  Non-crispy! So you're saying you cant make the one thing you have on the menu?! So we're sitting at a large table for a little lunch business meeting and the Manager comes up to us and with a snarky tone brings up that we have to pay by the minute. Hahahaha. One of those; \I'm kidding but not kidding\"" kind of remarks. Crowd was casual biz. Don't recommend it and don't see what the hype is about.""",0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Pretty dang good fast food chicken.The breading is light and flavorful all fresh from lemonade to Texas toast. I love there signature sauce but not a fan how they charge extra but it's all good in the hood. The service is fast and friendly I feel and I don't mind waiting a little longer for quality over quickness. I still feel chic file has em' beat but Raising Cane's jsut has a different style and more simpliar.,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,This place is awesome.....food is amazing. The sauce is to die for. The fries are so good and the service is amazing as well. Please go try for yourself. I love this place.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,My friend had recommended that he enjoyed this place when he was in Vegas.  They finally brought the first franchise location out in the valley. Raising Cane is a paradise for any chicken fingers lover.  There are movie posters all around inside the restaurant and even in the bathroom area.  A disco ball above is rotating and reflecting light beams down while you place your order.  They have plenty of spaces for parking.  The chicken fingers were really crispy; but nothing too special.   I do like the Texas Toast.  As Norm mentioned; I wish it was more garlicky as well.  The coleslaw was far too wet for me.  I think the Cane's sauce was similar to one of Arby's sauce. I so wanted to give them more stars; however there are so many places that have better chicken strips for that price.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Fast service. Chicken was good for fast food. They don't have ranch which really surprised me. The cane sauce is buttery. They have a drive thru so you can grab and run.,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"I'm really torn on how to review this place.  I wanted to give it more stars; trust me.  But the more I think about it; the worst I feel.  I mean; this place isn't bad; I just left kind of feeling meh.  Here's why.  For starters; I will say I love the service I got here.  The girl behind the counter was friendly; upbeat and really nice.  That's the one thing I liked about this place. Other points; not so much.    The menu here is really limited.  You basically have 4 menu options to choose from. That's it.  No side items; build your own meal; nothing. I'm a girl that likes options; and sometimes I don't want a gigantic meal; just parts of it.  So I went with the smallest order I cound find; which was the 3 chicken strips; fries; drink and Texas toast for $5.99.  When the food came out and it wasn't half bad.  I felt like the toast could have been cooked a little longer; even though it was really yummy.  Fries could have been a little crispier; and the chicken wings were pretty good.  Overall; the food was good; and not bad; I just wasn't moved or overly impressed with it as a whole.  Plus; I don't think you can get different dipping sauces; even though their \secret sauce\"" was quite tasty. What I mean; was I didn't see an option for ranch or bbq sauce on the menu.  I wish they had more menu options here. I know you can only cook chicken so many ways; but it would be nice to see a salad; or a la carte type ordering; which they didn't have.  Service was great; and overall not a half bad experience.""",1

JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Best chicken strips I've ever had!  The sauce is SO good!  Fries; bread; coleslaw...was all ok.  The chicken strips is all I'll order next time; and lots of them!,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I have to laugh at the fact that someone below seemed irritated by the lack of 'healthy' choices. It's a place serving fried chicken. If you want healthy; you started off in the wrong place. Fast food is never healthy; not even when you're ordering a salad. Enough of my rant on common sense from the masses.   This place does a very few things and they do them all well. I have been here several times. The chicken; fries; toast and cole slaw are always good. Is it going to send you screaming out to tell all your friends? Probably not. But it's good and their menu is easy to order from. It's also better chicken than you will find at probably 90% of the normal fast food drive-throughs.   It's definitely a place I like hitting up when I can and I will continue to do so. I have yet to have anything there that was a turn off.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,We loved Raising Cane's when we visited Vegas and wished we had this place in Phoenix.  Our wish came true! New hot spot; the parking lot was full of RC customers (we had to park across the street @ Olive Garden); chicken is hot and crunchy like we remembered in Vegas location; friendly customer service and friendly & fun atmosphere.  We now wish for a location close to North Scottsdale:) Whenever we are in Phx; we will stop for some yummy RC!,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Wow. It's not often I give a place less than three stars unless I had a real bad experience there; like shit service; huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding. In this case; I'll make a unique exception because I encountered none of those. Confused? Read on.  The wife went here last night and grabbed dinner on the way to meet me and the kid. It's. Just. Chicken. Strips. HOW can you make any sort of chain restaurant based on that? It's bland and literally the most boring meal I've ever had. Just one (SMALL) step up from a glass of water in flavor. Let's break it down: tasteless chicken with breading that makes even Church's; arguably the blandest food in the state; taste passable; shoestring crinkle-cut fries - like Del Taco's but half as thick (why?!); boring coleslaw; boring sauce. Probably the tastiest thing in the box was the soft buttered toast; but hell if I can't make that myself at home; right? It's just so absolutely pointless to go to this place. Go ANYwhere else. Mexican; burger; whatever. I'd rather eat airline food; seriously. I felt like I needed to dip the damn chicken in sulfuric acid in the desperate hope that that could revive my clinically dead tastebuds five minutes into the meal. And chicken strips are ALL they had on the menu; with the sides as mentioned above! I was still vaguely hungry but quit eating my Caniac with half the meal to go; it was THAT un-special. Chick Fil-A is a dozen orders of magnitude better than this place. At least ~they~ have some sort of flavour. Making different kinds of breading available and giving the option for dark (== flavour) meat chicken would go a long way towards getting this place an extra star. Making three; in case you aren't counting. I appreciated the high-rating reviews I read prior to going here - additional reviews from those reviewers will help me profile restaurants I will NEVER eat at and save me a crapload of angst and cash in the future. But take your kids here. They'll love it. It's why I gave it one more star than I was planning to.  About a pound of half-eaten meal went into the trash last night. Won't ever happen again. Wife; it wasn't your fault; it was mine. And Yelp's. (presses period key on keyboard at the end of that sentence so hard that the plastic splits),0

JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Last week we went to Raising Cane's for the first time.   It was pretty much a disappointment all the way around. The Texas toast was decent but the star of the show; the chicken fingers; were bland. I wasn't a fan at all. You Have To use the sauce they provide in order to get Any flavor.  We ordered the Caniac Combo and specified; No Fry's; Double Cole Slaw.   The person on the speaker repeated the order correctly and the order was repeated correctly again at the pay window. The food was picked up and we drove away.   Double Fry's; No Coleslaw. FML....   I hear there's a movement around the country for fast food workers to make $15 an hour. Thing's that make you go Hmmm... I digress.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Yum; yum; yum!!!  Tasty chicken fingers; fries and Texas Toast along with delicious dipping sauce.  Fast and friendly service. My whole family likes going to Cane's; so what more can I say.  If you want something different than the normal burgers and fries; Raising Cane's is a great choice.  Enjoy!,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,We got addicted to this place when we were working in Vegas for a few months so my husband and I were stoked when we spotted this location.  The service was exceptional as all raising canes experiences for us have been; the chicken is hot and juicy; the Cane's sauce yummy; and the sweet tea perfection!!! Wish they would open in California!,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Was kind of excited to check this plcae out. Especially since my kids love chicken fingers and order that wherever we go. Walked in and loved the charm of this place; big posters of Elvis; Beatles; movie posters like Hangover 2; dispecible me... Catchy music blaring and a disco ball hanging over the register area. My kids loved it already; but once we got over all of that and read the small menu I was shocked. I looove chicken fingers; but I just can't believe that's all they had along with fries and cole slaw..that's it ? Really??... we went ahead and ordered; the food was very good;but we really wanted other things than just fries. They need more sides; more choices in dipping sauce. The kids wanted ranch; not the peppery ;tangy sweet sauce they offered. Hubby wanted mashed potatos n' gravy and wasn't crazy about the runny cole slaw; I would have loved some buffalo wing sauce..but all they had was fries; toast; cole slaw and their special sauce. Like I said food was good; atmosphere charming; but no choices in menu. Everyone gets the same thing basiclly. I will be back though; food was good; simple and I know kids will eat it!,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"Was really hoping to find an alternative to my favorite chicken place as I suffer intense guilt every time I go there due to the fact that our \family values\"" are not aligned. Unfortunately; Raising Cane was not the answer.  There is not a single \""healthy\"" way to order -- seriously; you can't put something GREEN on the menu? Say; a few strips on a bed of lettuce; as an option?   It's chicken strips; fries; bread and slaw (optional). Period. The only question is a matter of specific quantities. The chicken was good; but not \""as\"" good and there is ONE type of sauce for dipping; and I do not care for it.    So; I tried but it looks like I'll still be battling my conscience next time I'm craving a chicken sandwich.""",0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Chicken was very moist and extremely hot. I got the six piece combo; the hubby got the chicken sandwich. The chicken was good and fries as well. I was told the toast was good but I personally didn't care for it. I personally didn't care for the Special Cane sauce. It was so bland; it tasted like buttermilk with some specks of pepper in it.  All in all the food was great and would come again but next time I'll share a combo.  The Service was also great and super helpful.,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"Best chicken fingers ever. The crispy outside is flavorful; and the chicken on the inside is tasty and moist. Not only are the fingers good; but the rest of the meal is just as amazing. The combination of fries and lightly toasted bread paired with the canes sauce is heaven in your mouth. Now the drink-- I am in love with their sweet tea; but if you don't like your tea super sweet; then I don't recommend it. And just as the icing on the cake; the service is friendly and even came around to ask how we were doing. Not too shabby for a \fast food\"" joint. Highly recommend!""",1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Great service; great chicken and a different sauce. I like that they keep it simple so it's easy to get a group order together for work or whatever. The people are always friendly and professional. The food is ALWAYS fresh and not just sitting in some hot box for hours waiting for a customer. It may take a little longer to get but it's worth it. This place is how I'd imagine chicken fingers would be made if In 'n Out did them.,1

JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,KFC move aside!  If you're looking for some really tasty non-greasy fried chicken; then look no further as this is the place to come.  Be warned though they only serve chicken fingers! The place can be a little crowded as it was on the weekend we visited so you may have to wait for a seat to open up if you're looking to dine in.  Alternatively you can choose the drive through but that line was long.   The restaurant was clean; well lit; and spacious though there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables/chairs. Service was fast and the menu was very simple which I'm in favor of!   Ordered the 3-piece basket and a lemonade.  The lemonade wasn't too sweet but cool; refreshing and tasted as if it was fresh squeezed. The fries was plentiful and was shared.  The basket comes with a slice of buttered toast similar to Texas Toast which was soft; chewy and practically melted in your mouth. The chicken tenders was well seasoned; crispy; not greasy; tasty; juicy but what really stands out is that it was light.  It's filling but you don't feel that overstuffed after eating them.  I really like the simplified menu; the lemonade drinks; and the chicken tenders which is definitely a draw for me to be back here!,1

JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Alright place to go if you want to try some slightly overpriced chicken strips. I ordered the standard box combo and the food was made quickly. (You definitely get your money's worth on the portion-size).  The chicken itself is nothing spectacular; I like the strips at Chick-fil-A a lot better. The sauce is unique and I'd definitely try it ; though the sample they gave me was a bit watery.,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I felt like a little kid eating really good chicken fingers and French fries; there aren't many options here. The staff was super friendly and the stand out item has git to be the buttery Texas toast; the fries are nothing special and the chicken was ok. One dipping sauce per order is a little cheap for the $$ your gonna spend and only one flavor? McDonald's has more options; I suggest you bring your leftover honey mustard and bbq dipping sauce with you when you visit Canes.  P.S.  the sweet tea at McDonald's is way better too; sorry guys.,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"This is a newer chicken place in town. They server Chicken Fingers; Toast; Fries; and their special Sauce. If anyone has ever been to Lucky Wishbone in Tucson; it very much reminds me of their chicken fingers meal. It is excellent and their homemade lemon aid is to die for. We always have to order extra because we fight over it.   Slightly pricy for a fast food place; but you do get the quality you pay for and they have a club called the Caniac Club you can sign up for and get free meals.  Whats not to love? As my 2 year old says \Bok Bok Chicky!!!\""""",0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Interesting concept; only service chicken tenders; but they are good!,0
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,This place is phenomenal! It took me a long time to go here because they serve chicken fingers. Now I wish I went a long time ago! Service was excellent. Only wish we were closer to it,1
JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,OK; so I had to try the concept eventually.  It certainly isn't the only chain to work with a very limited menu.  The food was ok.  The service was pleasant.  Enough people must like the place as noon was approaching it got pretty full and there was also take out orders.  If chicken was what I had in mind and I was close I would go again.  But I would not drive across town.,1

KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,This Culver's has the worse service of any fast food place that I have ever visited. Went last Saturday and sat behind one car in the drive thru. Sat for five minutes with the car in front of me being ignored. My passenger actually called Culver's to try to get helped of course hung up. Finally took order and when I paid rather than apologize for the wait clerk is laughing about it. They make you pull up and than when it backs up the honking begins. Food would have to perfect to make up for the sorry service and it is not even close. If you want to be laughed at for expecting even minimal service this is the place for you.,0

KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,"I was searching for a place that served cheese curds last night and Culvers popped up as being the \highest ranking\"" place with them. Do NOT go here for the cheese curds!! Especially if you've ever had good ones at San Tan Flats; A&W or even Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't like the breading they put on them here - they tasted more like a bad mozzarella stick than a curd. Not a fan.  I did like my burger. Fries were OK - not my favorite and I don't think I'd get them again. My husband's chicken strips were good - just pricey! I also liked how their place is set up. They have an area to order (with a HUGE) menu; and then a separate dining area. It makes it feel more like a sit down restaurant then fast food which is nice.  The custard was SO good!! I got the flavor of the day (toffee pecan) and I'd come back just for it again!!   Be sure to sign up for their e-mail and text club. I got a BOGO deal and a free scoop of ice cream off their yelp check in offer too! Made it under $18 for the 3 of us.""",0
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,This is no In n Out Burger. The menu is pretty extensive; the burgers are okay; and the service is great (which is why they get a three). I will be back again and update if I find something better; but this time was nothing to write home about. Those that say Culver's is better than In n Out must be out of their minds!,1
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,I thought this place was pretty bad - bordering on gross.  We went for the first time on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy; a bit dirty (tables not clean; trash on floor) and the menu is pretty large and overwhelming.  When I finally got my three kids to tell me what they wanted I went up and ordered.    Wow!  For fast food that was pricey!    My husband ordered a burger and fries.  He then realized from the nutritional menu I picked up that the fries were not gluten free so he couldn't eat them.  I had a veggie burger with cheese and mushrooms.  I almost couldn't eat it.  It was the worst veggie burger I had ever had.  I also tried the cheese curd - a mix of yellow and white cheese; deep fried and they offered me packets of BBQ sauce or ranch to dip them in.  They were not good.  I don't recommend them.  The custard was the only thing that wasn't bad but I don't think I will be able to stomach going back to get it again.,0
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,The food is great but the attention to detail is pathetic!  My first time their I had a chocolate Reese's concrete mixer.  It was amazing!  Been back for it now three more times and all three times my order was wrong!  1st time I received the mixer with Reese's pieces; not Reese's buttercups; 2nd time back added hot fudge and received vanilla ice cream and 3rd time back I received vanilla ice cream with snickers.   So to re-cap;  Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup Received: What I ordered exactly  Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup Received: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Pieces   Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup & hot fudge Received: Vanilla ice cream with Reese's Buttercup & hot fudge  Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup & hot fudge Received: Vanilla ice cream with Snickers & hot fudge  Keep In mind I just started Invisalign as well so my teeth are a little loose so eating the Reese's pieces and the snickers was somewhat difficult.  UPDATE:  Went again May 18th; ordered another Tall Chocolate Reese's buttercup concrete mixer.  What did I get a tall chocolate mixer with NO Reese's; only ice cream.  How difficult is it to get an order correct!!!???,0
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,Casual atmosphere; order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Burgers are fresh and hot.  Order the cheese curds; it is an extra $1 with your basket; but they are like mini cheese sticks! The custard (ice cream!) is smooth and made on site. Great as shakes too.,0
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,This place had juicy burgers; crisp fries and yummy onion rings! Took the fam from SF here and they loved it! The kids loved the chicken tenders and the frozen custard! So much yum! It was about $48 bucks for 7 people to eat so not bad! We came hungry and left full and satisfied. Staff was friendly and very efficient; the lines were taken care of in a orderly fashion because it was super packed; but they made it bearable. Will definitely come back for a juicy burger craving! :-),1
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,I would give 2 stars because to me; this food is at absolute best 2 star food.  But I think other people would like it more than me.  They absolutely kill their burgers with cheese.  Huge amounts of very strong flavored cheese.  Cheddar; I believe.  Most people like cheese more than me; so they might like it slightly more.  I do really love many cheeses; but when they are the only thing I can taste on my burger; calm it down!  I couldn't taste anything but cheese.  If you removed the burger; it'd taste the same.  Also the cheese is cold and the bread is awful.  This place recreates those overcooked preformed dense picnic party burgers you had growing up.  Except with tons of bright yellow cheese.  Tons of it.  If they have a grilled cheese sandwich; just order that.  Or ask for no cheese on your burger.,0

KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,As far as fast food goes; Culver's definitely has THE best customer service hands down! Burgers are good and my kids love the custards!,1
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,I have only ever been to this Culvers and I come at least once a week.  Never has my order ever been wrong except for tonight. After repeating it twice what I'd like on my burger I get home to find only the entirely different burger in my bag. I come to Culvers for the made to order freshness and tonight I got a burger with everything BUT what I specifically told them I wanted on it. After driving back and telling them I wanted what was on the receipt (because that was correct) they questioned me what was on my burger.. Obviously some new employees training went way wrong. Im disappointed this experience was so awful and un apologetic.,0
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,"Was very excited to go to Culvers as I've been hearing about it for a few years now.  They opened up a location near me and I figured I would try it out on my way home at lunchtime.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger with one patty; onion rings; and a strawberry shake from the drive through.  They give you a number and have you pull up to wait for your burger to be ready.  I got my bag of food and before driving off; decided to check to make sure it was right.  Alas; no onion rings just fries.  I shut my car off and walked all the way around the building to try to find the entrance as the door nearest the drive thru is for employees only.    I go in and let them know that my order was not right.  I acknowledge that the receipt does say fries but tell them that I had ordered onion rings.  The 3 people at the counter look at me like I'm crazy and then one of them goes off to tell someone else who is in the back.  This young lady comes up to me and looks at my receipt and I again acknowledge that it says fries but tell her that I'm pretty sure I said onion rings.  She looks at me and pauses and then says; \That's fine.  It will be $1.08\"".  I'm slightly annoyed at this point because I'm not sure why this is taking so long.  I tell her that I do not have my wallet and that it is in the car because I just ran out of the car to get my order fixed.  She gives me a \""Don't know what to tell you\"" look and says that it'll cost $1.08 for the onion rings because they cost more than the fries.  I'm beyond frustrated so I tell them that it's fine and I will just take these.    I get home and the burger is so-so.  The cheese was smaller than the patty and there were hardly any mushrooms on it.  The fries were bland.  The strawberry shake wasn't bad but  not as thick as I like.    So unfortunately; they lost a customer because of this frustrating customer service.  If they had a screen at the drive thru order stop OR if they even had the girl taking order REPEAT BACK the order this whole fiasco could have been avoided.    And seriously; they should have just taken back the fries and given me the onion rings.  A bad burger I could have overlooked and probably would have returned to try something else.  But annoying customer service is hard to get past.""",0

KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,Best CheeseBurgers in the East Valley !  Service by there employees is always above and beyond !,1
KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,I love Culver's chicken strips and their cheese curds. I ate at a Culvers up in Wisconsin so I was excited to see one here. Same good food. Service was also good though it took a while to get my food but when it came out it was hot and worth the wait.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I was so happy to see a 5 Guys in Phoenix.  I love their burgers and this place is just as good as the ones on the east coast.  The burgers are cooked fresh when you order them. the burger is juicy; the bacon is crispy  and the cheese melty. Delish.  You can choose from a wide selection of toppings at no additional cost.   I always get the small bacon cheeseburger and a drink. No fries.  All 5 guys fries are limp. I like my fries crunchy.  If they changed their fries I would up them to a 5 star rating.  For those that like a juicy burger reminescent  of what you make at home; with toppings customized to fit your appetite for the day 5 Guys is it.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"Five Guys is good eats.  We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.  Honestly; I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger; but I like the selection of toppings (can you say; \fresh jalapenos!\"") and the great selection of sodas.  The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.  I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!); but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.  Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week; it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours; unless you want to wait for a table.  Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out; but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.  3 tips:  -Our family of 4 (2 adults; 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries; though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.  -Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker \""Little Cheeseburger\"" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the \""Little\"" one is perfectly sufficient for me; especially after I load up on toppings.  -Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and \""POOF!\""; you'll get it!  Enjoy!  UPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to 4 stars.  The last several visits; the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!""",0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,My sister and I picked up lunch Saturday. We got 2 bacon double cheeseburgers and 1 large fry; the total was $20. The burger was worth every penny. They have a wide variety of toppings and the burger is made when you order it.   The burger & fries were so filling that I skipped dinner that night and fell asleep shortly after I ate. I'll be back....not too soon though.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"The Good: The Bacon Cheeseburger  The Bad: The futuristic Battlestar Galactica soda machine that dispensed diet coke that had hints of cherry; dr. pepper and sprite in it. It was like an old \suicide\"" drink.....except the machine actually chooses the flavors for you and it tastes like hell.  The Ugly: $12.54 for a burger; fries (which could have fed a village) and a coke. I understand that their better ingredients would warrant a higher price and I actually didn't mind paying that price until after I was done.  Back to the fries for a minute....the fries were pretty good; not great. I do not complain often about having too much food but the size of the order of fries for one person is just plain stupid. More than half ended up in the trash.   My recommendation would be to go with another person and split a burger and fries......and drink tea or water so you do not have to deal with the T-1000 super duper drink dispenser.""",0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,My first experience with Five Guys was in DC and at the time; I wished for a location to open in Phoenix.  Wish granted!  My Mom and I visited the new place this week and I was not surprised to see it as busy as it was.  I had the burger with cheese; lettuce; tomato; pickles; jalapeños; and bell peppers with cajun fries and Mom had the hot dog with bacon and onion with regular fries.  We could have easily shared one small order of fries and I didn't make it through half of my burger; but what I did eat was perfection.  I was also thrilled to enjoy Cherry Coke!  If you're looking for a quiet spot to eat  your meal; avoid this place.  It's loud and hectic; but that's part of its charm; I think.  The people at the counter were really friendly and smiling; which was good to see.  Bonus?  A clean restroom!  I'm looking forward to returning to try the hot dog!,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"Wow. Major overload of food here. Even the regular fries is an amazingly huge size. Granted; they are fries that have seen potatoes very recently; which equals fresh. Too much salt though. And; as a guy; no way I can go in and order one of the \little\"" burgers; that's what the ladies at my table ordered. So; it's gotta be the double cheese; with bacon (of course); with everything. Only problem was; I couldn't seem to figure out their newfangled soda machine. I tried to get a cherry vanilla Coke; but it came out tasting like regular Coke. Oh well; maybe next time.""",0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"YES; I am only give Five Guys 2 stars! Can you believe it? Me; the woman who raved about having a Five Guys in the area. The woman; who LOVED; LOVED; LOVED Five Guys when I lived in Virgina. This Five Guys does not even begin to compare to how they do it in VA.   I was so excited about getting a burger and fries today. I mean I was \cheating\"" by going for a burger and fries instead of working out. Walking into this Five Guys I was excited. The staff were friendly; the place was spotless; and they were getting orders out fast. So I ordered my little bacon cheeseburger with jalapenos; mustard; grilled onions and mushrooms and a order of regular fries. About 7 mins later I was out the door and headed home. The food smelled heavenly in the bag and I couldn't wait to get home to devour my meal.   I get home; open the bag and grabbed a few fries. Yum; we are off to a good start. I dig to the bottom of my bag and grab my burger. I slowly unwrap it; take a bite; and say WTF? Where is the meat? I swear that burger lacked flavor and meat. I mean I remember when even the little burger was still to big. Yes I know that the little bacon cheeseburger means it only comes with one patty; but does it have to be the thinnest hamburger patty ever? I mean McDonald's even has a bigger burger than this sandwich did. I was so disappointed. The best part of my sandwich was the bacon and the toppings since the actual burger was more like spread. At least I had enough fries to feed myself and two friends and they were pretty good.   So two stars. One star for the fast friendly service and one star for all the fries I could eat and for the bacon on my burger. Otherwise you get a big fat FAIL!!!!!!! I may give you a chance to redeem yourself in a few months but the next time I go; you had better bring it!   PS I ended up going to work out anyway since I was so disappointed! FAIL!""",0

VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Five guys; you are still letting me down. You are nowhere near as good as you were in VA. I gave you another try tonight and all I can say is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Your patties are so thin and it appears that the only way I will actually be able to taste the burger on the bun is if I order a regular cheeseburger which consist of two patties. I should be able to order a little cheeseburger and still be able to taste the actual burger. I will wait another six months or so to give you one final try here in Arizona before I give up on you all together. Sad; just sad!  PS Your fries are still pretty good and the service was great but your burgers here in Arizona really do leave something to be desired .,1

VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Every time I drive by this place it's packed. So we decided to give it a try. The burgers are good; big and you can get your buger your way. The fries are fresh cut and you're informed of where the potatos are coming from that are making your fries. A small order of fries severs 2 no problem. Can't go wrong at this place... Will be back for sure,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,OMG this is a great burger. Better then In -N- Out. Everything is made fresh. This burger is just the right thickness. I not a huge fan of really thick burgers so this place works for me. The burgers are juicy and they have lots of toppings you can pile on. The 1 and only complaint is this is one of those places that tries to sell you fries separate. Of course they always say - our small order is enough for 2-. This bothers me cause when I go to a fast food type place I'm usually by myself and I need fries for one not fries for 2. Now your $5 burger turns into $10 when adding a drink and fries. So unless your someone that goes here to get a burger and a burger only you will never spend just $5 here. The sad thing is all the fries they are waisting when your forcing one Person to by enough fries for 2. Aside from that the burger is great but unfortunately for $10 burgers these days i can go to so many places like fez and or grinders. This place needs a combo meal for around $7 and I would stop here more often.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,5 Guys is great.  Love the burgers and fries; though every time we eat there we have a lot of fries leftover.  Usually get the double Bacon cheeseburger with everything and A1 sauce; fries and a drink and always leave full and happy.  Finally tried a hot dog which was Great.  You can choose the same topping for your hamburger for your hot dog. Much better than IN&OUT and your burger fast food chains.  Yes a little pricer but willing to pay more to have my food cook to order than a reheated burger.  Very friendly and happy staff. The noisy atmosphere works for me and JR; he can be a little more vocal and not bother anyone.  Mellow Yellow is good but also good to see Coke Zero on tap too.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"Decent burgers; really friendly service; and a very basic; straightforward menu.     I was interested in trying this place out after reading all the rave reviews from all over the country so when it finally opened up in Phoenix; I decided to give it a shot.         The burgers are definitely good; done very well; the fries are great tasting too and they give you A LOT of them; if you go and order the \large fries\"" you're going to find a whole paper sack absolutely filled to the brim with them.               All in all; Five Guys is a nice place to grab a quick lunch; a little bit on the pricy end for fast food but there is a difference in quality between this place and the McBurgerBarns out there; that's for sure.""",0

VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"I kept hearing good things about the place; and they're popping up all over Phoenix; so I decided to give it a try.  I was not impressed with the place.  $11.78 for a bacon cheeseburger; regular fries; and regular drink (the smallest portion of fries and drink.  The burger was two patties; for a total of 7 ounces of beef.  Seems a little high for a fast-food quality meal.  The beef wasn't bad - cooked well done but still a little juicy.  It didn't have a lot of flavor; which puts it behind places like Fatburger or In-N-Out; and well behind places like Fuddruckers or Islands.  With so many topping options; it was a little disappointing to not have a cheese option - the American cheese they used was a little greasy.  It would have been nice to be able to choose; at least from the mainstream cheeses like cheddar and swiss; maybe even pepper jack or mozzarella.  I ordered it with lettuce; tomatoes; and grilled onions; each of which was better than the counterparts at In-N-Out; and probably on par with Fatburger.  They were reasonably fresh-tasting; but not \good burger place\"" fresh.  The fries were really not impressive - I probably should have ordered the cajun fries; maybe then they would have had some decent flavor.  The free peanuts were a nice addition; but it's strange to have a place with shelled peanuts but no place to put the shells.  The places I've been to with buckets of shelled peanuts either have something like a bucket at each table; or you just throw your shells on the floor; kind of adding to the decor - this place didn't do either - not really a big deal; but just seemed a little strange.  Overall; I'd say the place is overpriced; a little bland; and definitely overhyped.""",0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,5 stars for an upscaled fast food burger joint.  My daughter enjoys this place; and when we are in the neighborhood; we will lunch here.  Prices are obviously posted; so you know going in this is not a $1.00 burger.  But you get what you pay for; and Five Guys is no exception. Expect a simple starter burger around $4.5; big old bacon cheeseburger checks in at under $8.  EVERY time; the order is accurate.  The fries are made of REAL potatoes; served  very hot; fresh; super yum. One regular order easily  covers two people.   I love how you can choose any number of add-ons and condiments and there's no extra charge- this includes extra cheese; grilled onions; grilled jalapenos; etc. And there's a huge assortment of condiments to choose from.  You can also get your burger wrapped in lettuce or as a bowl if you don't want a bun. The burger itself is made of high quality beef.  Casual environment; music playing when we've been there.  It's clean; employees are very friendly.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Ok; I was a little torn on this one. I wanted to give it 4 stars but this is why it only received 3.   THREE STAR REASONS:   First; it was a little pricey. 25 dollars and some change for 1 bacon cheeseburger; 1 little bacon cheeseburger; 1 little cheeseburger; 1 regular Cajun fry and 2 regular drinks.   Second; the fries even though hand cut they weren't hot and actually could have been cooked a little more; they still were a little hard in the middle. If they would have been left in the fryer a few seconds longer they totally would have reminded me of the fries my Mother made at home.  WORTH 4 STARS:   First; the uber cool beverage dispensers.   Second; the service was fast and friendly even though they were extremely busy.   Three; the burger. It was hot; gooey; loaded with all of the fresh toppings I asked for. I loved the taste of the sesame seed bun. I can't find any fault with the burger except the $5.29 price.   Is it great food? No; it's good for fast food; but honestly for the $25 my husband; son and I could have had a nice lunch at a sit down restaurant for the same price. Would I go back. Yes if I was in the area and wanted a burger.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Yummy yum ! I ordered the little cheeseburger and cajun fries....It was really well done...I luved it and will go back soon...someday when the craving for burgers and fries strikes again !!,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Best Fast Food Burger in town!!! I go here with co-workers probably too often; but it is to good to pass up. At lunch time this place is hoppin.  Check out the cool new Coke A Cola machines you can get raspberry Sprite!!!!. Ok back to the burgers; actually burgers and dogs.. I dont' eat the dogs but I have only heard good things. The burger comes with everything and I mean everything so look at the menu and only state omissions from the toppings offerings. The Mini burger will fill you just fine and a small order of fresh fries are plenty for two people. These fries are just as good if not better then in and out!!!!!,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Great burgers. Fast service. Not enough seating. So what; you get free peanuts? Cajun fries are nothing special. Absolutely no feeling of human/customer service presence. In and out is cheaper and better...,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I'd been waiting for this Five Guys to open ever since they put the signage up a few weeks ago; and was pumped to see the 'now open' sign when I drove by.  I was able to convince the wife to go later for dinner.  Walked in around 5:30 or so; and there was only one person in front of us in line; and the restaurant (and nice patio) was about 50% full.  We ordered quickly and got situated at our table before I went up to get drinks.  I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of drinks that were available; I counted 14 different fountain drinks (including Cherry Coke; Mello Yello; Orange Fanta and the other usual Coke stand-bys) as well as a Gold Peak dispenser with three different flavors.  I also thought it was nice that all over the restaurant there were boxes of peanuts for patrons to enjoy while waiting for their meals to come out.  My assumption was that it takes awhile to get the food.  Well; I was wrong on that one; because my food was up pretty quickly (less than five minutes).  I'd imagine if it was really busy it'd take take a touch longer; but for this visit; it was good.  I had a cheese burger (which was double pattied); the wife had a cheese veggie sandwich and we split the smallest size of fries.  Now this may have been the smallest size...but we could have probably fed four people off the amount that we got; it was a very generous portion.  Good flavor; but they weren't crisp.  I thought they could have been cooked a little more; the wife thought maybe they had sat out for a bit.  The burger; I liked; meat seemed nice a fresh; with good flavor.  The bun was fresh; but I've had better.  Off one serving; if I had to choose between In N Out or Five Guys forever; I'd probably give In N Out the nod; but this burger is definitely bigger/heartier than what you are going to get at In N Out.  I could see Five Guys growing on me with a few more visits.    I had previous heard that Five Guys was kind of expensive...I thought it was a pretty good value for our two sandwiches; fries and one soda (wife got water)...less than $15.  (Note:  I did think it odd that there was a tip bucket up front...I mean; there isn't a waiter; I had to go get my own food and I bused my own table...I wouldn't tip at McDonald's...).  Anyways; this is a solid 3.5 for me.  I could definitely see this moving up to a 4 after another visit; but I wasn't blown away this time.  I am excited they are here and a solid burger option for me.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,So my first experience was on opening night for this location and it was alright.  It was pretty packed; and loud; so I think I didn't talk loud enough when I placed my order and I wound up missing the lettuce and tomato on my burger.  Their bacon comes extra crispy and didn't seem like anything special.  Overall the burger was pretty decent; however I thought it'd be much better the way I ordered it and sans bacon as I'm not a crispy bacon fan.  Also I ordered the regular fries; their smallest size; and it's still a huge amount.  They fill the cup that the fries come in; then upon putting that and the burger in the bag; they dump another scoop of fries on top of the whole thing which could potentially make your burger wrapper very greasy if you were getting it to go.  On my second visit; it was much slower and my order came exactly as I ordered it with all the condiments.  This time without bacon and the addition of lettuce and tomato; it was quite an enjoyable burger.  I ordered the regular Five Guys fries this time and while still being too much to eat; they were tasty.  All in all for a pretty big burger; fries and a drink; you're looking at 10 bucks.  A couple things to note here are the amount of things you can put on the burger.  It's quite a decent selection.  Also there are boxes of peanuts with trays at the end of the checkout line that they offer for free to snack on while you eat.  Finally; they have Mello Yellow on the fountain here which may be enough to sway your descision in and of itself.  The establishment itself is quite clean and well laid out.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I'm normally not opposed to greasy food; but I didn't like that my burger bun was soaked. Don't get me wrong; the beef and the fries were excellent.  Service was quick; staff was friendly; and their soda machine is AWESOME. Anyway; I would certainly not mind trying this place again.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"3.75   FTR I am NOT a fan of flat fried burgers; I prefer grilled over a flame. Man I love the taste of a fire kissed hunk of ground beef.   I read a few reviews and thought I should at least try the burger. I am glad I did.   Hand pattied; fresh burgers; flat grilled to well done but still juicy. The beef had almost 0 flavor by itself but added nice texture to the entire burger as a whole. As a burger \traditionalist\"" I ordered the regular with bacon; lettuce; tomato's; pickle and mustard. No Jalapenos or cool little add ons. The condiments were all really fresh and had good flavor. (most tomato's lack this now a days) The double patty was a little much; I may go with the single next time.   The building was busy with customers and staff; they run a tight ship.   The prices can get a little high unless you eat smart; the frys are large; the burgers are large and the drinks are $2.19 for a large. Get the single burgers; share a fry and get water or skip the frys and eat the free peanuts.LOL   I will go back.  4 stars for a flat top grilled burger... must have been good.""",0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,While it is not a preferred way of cooking beef. I am a fan.   Service is great; Jim T was more then helpful while ordering and made the experiance even better.  The place is always clean; the peanuts keep me happy and the burgers do not disappoint.,1

VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I finally stopped in here for the first time! First of all; the girl at the register was super nice about explaining the menu and ordering process for us first-timers. I also like the free peanuts while you wait for your order. I ordered a little burger with bacon and the bacon was fantastic. It was crispy and they were not stingy with it. My husband ordered a regular cheeseburger. He said the cheese wasn't that great. I like the fact that they are hand formed patties but mine was falling apart which was kind of annoying. The fries were really good as well and I would like to go back to try the cajun style ones. On a side note; my sister went into the bathroom while we were there and she said it was clean and smelled like cinnamon so thats a plus as well! Overall; the food was good; but nothing to die for.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I like Five Guys.  Liked them even better when I ate buns and red meat.  Now I still eat their fries.........because they are made in a dedicated fryer.  See there is no other item on the menu that they make in their fryers so I don't need to worry about being glutened there.  Awesome!  Oh; and said fries?  Done in peanut oil so they are beyond YUM!  They are also very good about doing a bunless burger for you with extra toppings if you cannot eat one.  I've had them bunned (before celiac dx); bunless (while still eating red meat) and none...........  The only bummer here is there are only burgers and fries and drinks on the menu.  No chicken sandwich.........so I cannot even order a bunless chicken.  That makes for only fries I can eat.  Luckily; my family can eat here and get me fries and I can run next door to Chipotle for a bowl and everyone is happy!  Oh; did I tell you that I mix mayo and catsup together for my fries?  Try it.  You'll love it or be grossed out by it.  Yeah.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,My Hubby & I came here for lunch this past Saturday & we thought it was pretty damn good.   I got the little bacon cheeseburger & Hubs got the bacon cheeseburger (2 patties of beef). We are 1 in the same & got the same toppings: lettuce; pickles & mustard. Oh & he opted for the grilled onions which I wish I had done; too. We each got a regular order of fries as well. We should of just shared an order; more than half of the bag was filled with fries! Can't even imagine how big the large order is.   We thought it was cool that they have peanuts & that you can just toss the shells on the ground; something different. For our burgers; fries & drinks it was about $22 & some change; not too bad.  We will definitely come back for lunch; but not anytime soon since these kinds of places you should only eat at once in a while. We'll see if we like it as much the 2nd time around. We get easily burnt out on places like this: i.e. Culver's & In N Out.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,This was the first 5 Guys I ever ate at. A simple; high quality burger. Meat; meat; meat! I've never had a soggy fry here. Never order a large fry; only a normal one. You get enough for two hungry guys!  Good service. They get the order right; 95% of the time.  Do check at the display; though; as a dining partner got bacon when they didn't want it.   Really busy; but lots of parking. Writing this review makes me hungry for one; now.,1

VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Another cool place found through yelp ... and not just me; I bumped into fellow yelpers Daren C. and Ryan C. here at lunch. They came here because; like me; they read a review for this place posted earlier today. Because it was lunchtime; the place was busy; but the line moved quickly enough and the people taking the orders were friendly. I enjoyed the baconburger I ordered - quite a stack; with crispy bacon; two patties; plus the condiments I ordered (lettuce; tomato; pickles; ketchup; mustard); and the fries were great - thicker than at most places; adequately salted; and a nice balance of softness and slight crispiness. Plenty of places to sit; especially since they have a nice patio for al fresco dining ... and don't forget to serve yourself with the peanuts in the shell to munch on while waiting for your number to be called.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"Love this place!  Went yesterday with a friend and had a great burger experience. I noticed a definite \50's vibe\"" going on when we were greeted by a friendly worker behind the cash register.  Unique burger options and love the fact that their \""toppings\"" don't cost anything extra. Had the single cheeseburger sans onions and Cajun fries - very fresh and tasty!  Was surprised they didn't have ranch dressing or cook-to-order meat (they only grilled medium well).  Big fan of their soda machines! Literally had SO many options such as PowerAde (and Zero) with raspberry; grape; etc etc. You could even order Sprite with grape! Huge accolades there.  Food impressed me as well as the set-up and cheery service. Great job!""",1

VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Great neighborhood burger joint. I feel like even as a franchise; they haven't skipped any corners.  My only qualm is that I'm highly allergic to tomatoes. Even though I do not order tomatoes on my burger; it never fails that they put one on there; and I have to tell them to remake. Not sure if they are on auto pilot sometimes; but definitely something I always check for.  The soda machine used to be an attraction but I've started seeing these machines in other restaurants now.  The cajun fries are tasty but I wish they were just a little more crispy and not as soggy.  Fun place for a quick lunch or dinner; but the prices seem a little high for a *regular* spot.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I have been to five guys on several occasions. Love the burgers and fresh fries. On this visit the man running the register gave us great advice on ordering fries a certain way which saved me some cash and still gave my family plenty of fries.    This isn't the cheapest burger joint in town but the food is good and fresh. It's a nice treat and a good break from the usual fast food grind.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"Below is a general review of the two AZ locations I have been to; and at the bottom will be notes specific to this location...  This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.  But if you like a burger that was made when you order it or fries that are real potatoes and don't taste like the cup they came in then this place could be a great option.  They are a little pricier than your average quick service joint; but its worth it.  The portions are HUGE; even if you order the \regular\"" fries and the \""little\"" burger they are still BIG.  They don't charge per topping beyond the norm like Smashburger; and they have tons of toppings to choose from.  Would love to see a fried egg option; but other than that the majority of burger loving taste buds will find topping options that please them.  They have some non-burger choices as well; which is nice.  Hot dogs; grilled cheese (which people keep saying is a must try) and a veggie sandwich.  Eating here is a 5 napkin type experience; a lil messy; a lil crazy; but oh so yummy!  Hint: if you are transporting 5 guys in your car; definitely put something between the bag and your (clothes; passenger seat; floor mat; etc..)  the grease WILL leak through the bag.   I agree with a below post that the placement of peanut snacking boxes are a little awkward  (and frankly I don't get why they exist at all; but whatever)  BELL ROAD Location Specific:  Easier to get to if you enter on the Bell road side.  Staff seems to be more personable than the Mill ave location (at least on the day I visited)  Parking is vast and free.""",1

VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Wanted a burger for dinner and wanted to try something new. My first impression wasn't the greatest. They have bags of their french friends and boxes of oil all over the place as a display! Is this their idea of decor or did they just run out of room in the back? The music is SO LOUD you can't even think. I can barely hear the girl as I was trying to give her my order.   You mean to tell me the $6.99 cheeseburger is ONLY a cheeseburger? No fries or anything with it? Almost $12 for a cheeseburger and fries? NO DRINK. That's crazy!! I didn't realize it was that expensive until I was ordering and I didn't want to embarrass myself and walk away. I figured I'd try it.  I do have to say; the food is very good. Fries were delicious. Burger was good too but really sloppy.   Would I go again? Probably not. The price is just out of control! $12 for a burger and fries is just insane! Whataburger and In-n-Out has food that's just as delicious; right down the street; and literally HALF the price.   Good food but nothing to write home about. I just can't get over the price!,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"A friend and I decided to give this place a try and I'm glad we did! The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was fresh and delicious. I ordered a cheeseburger and my friend ordered the bacon cheeseburger. We both really enjoyed them.  We were disappointed that the menu only included regular and little burgers. We were informed that the \regular\"" burgers were always two patties and the \""little\"" burgers were one patty. How can you go wrong there? As far as I'm concerned the optimal burger to bread to condiment ratio is 2:1:1 so a \""regular\"" burger here is perfect!   We both ordered fries and the cashier asked us if we were sure? We asked why and he informed us that the large fries were REALLY large and we could probably just split an order. We said sure and looked at each other with a bit of incredulity but went ahead anyway. What the heck; save a few bucks.  When our order came up there was definitely enough for us to share and there were actually too much for us to finish. Too bad those excess tasty morsels had to be discarded.  The drink dispensers were high-tech and cool. Neither of us had ever seen dispensers like these and missed out on the different flavors available because of our unfamiliarity. I will definitely explore this further on my next visit. Vanilla Grape Orange Sprite/Coke anyone?  One final thought... I never saw 5 guys there. The facility was staffed by 2 guys and 2 girls. I'm good with that!  I may revise this in the future because I will absolutely return!""",1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Good Burger; taste like a homemade burger off the grill.  Fries are good; just make sure if there is two of you to order one small fry and share; it's quite large.  Burger comes with whatever you tell them from a list of items.. Good selection and good food.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Best fast food burger. I love In n Out; and I think this one is better. The topping choices are unbeatable; the Little Burger is plenty for an adult; and tastes really good.  Fries are excellent; although I prefer In n Out's more.   Coke machine is awesome. Coke Zero Cherry Vanilla is my personal favorite.  Improvements: more condiment choices at the counter. Only ketchup available at the counter seems skimpy. Maybe decreases the clutter but different types of mustards; relish; maybe peppers would be a nice addition. I understand you can order it but I would have preferred to put the sauces on myself.  Overall an super burger.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I finally had Five Guys. We made 800 jokes on the way; after we ordered; I swore the cashier told us to enjoy some penis while we waited. Excuse me? Oh. Peanuts. Of course; all burger joints have peanuts?! A bit bizarre; but they were tasty. We all ordered a burger to our liking and we shared cajun fries. My cheeseburger with grilled onions and jalapenos was good; it tasted like something you'd make at home. The fries were terrible. Not sure how they've earned such recognition. I like crisp fries; these were flimsy and greasy; and I wasn't a fan of cajun seasoning; either. Overall; I stand by In-N-out.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I have been meaning to try this place out for a long time but I've been hesitant because of reviews stating it's over priced. While I agree that the burgers and fries cost way too much I think the burger was delicious and the fries were as well. I never get onions on a burger but since they were grilled I had to give it a try. Yum.  The fries reminded me of the fries we would have at home when I was living with my parents. We never bought frozen fries and always made our own so Five Guys were spot on. I ordered the small fries but I still couldn't finish them all. Very good though.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I'm not a huge meat eater but my first bite of that tasty; juicy; scrumptious burger triggered me to attack the rest cave man carnivore style.  The burger was super fresh and you can put any of the fixins you want at no extra charge. I also ordered the fries which are natural cut and salted to perfection. They give you a generous portion; plenty to share. I'd never tried fries with malt vinegar but my lunch mate insisted and oh boy was it delish! Wayyyy better than ketchup.   The restaurant was well kept  and the staff was friendly. We sat outside because the weather was especially nice; but the seating wasn't so comfortable; so I'd probably opt for inside next time.   I will definitely be back next time I'm craving a fix for my meat eating side.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Had an excellent experience at this Five Guys about a weeks ago. Everyone working there was just so pleasant especially the guy taking our order. He had a huge smile on his face the whole time. The employees all seemed to be happy & had a good flow going as they made the burgers. The line moved quick & we got our food pretty fast. & the food was absolutely delicious!! I loved it!! The little cheeseburger is big & delicious & the little fries are big enough for two. I feel weird giving a fast food restaurant 5 stars but I have no reason to mark it down. Will most definitely return.,1
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"I used to be an In-N-Out fan but Five Guys is now my new favorite new fast food burger joint.  I think Five Guys gives you a good value for its price. The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings (from mushrooms to peppers) to add on your burger. Also; their fries are pretty good; though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones.  Be sure to tell them you want a \little\"" hamburger or cheeseburger or they will give you a double patty burger.""",0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Hands down the best burger you can get for under $20 The place smells Holy Amazing when you come through the door! The burgers are incredible but you dont feel like you just ate a brick for lunch when your done. They basically give you 5 orders of fries when you ask for them and I recommend the seasoned ones.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I am not a burger girl but this place is AWESOME. We don't have one on our side of town so on the weekends if we want a good burger; we make the diverges are super fresh and fires are simple but tasty. I would recommend ordering one regular size order of fires and sharing with 2-3 people. It is really a ton of fires. Overall I highly recommend even if your not a burger lover like myself.,0
VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"Just moved to Phoenix from Southern California and while exploring the area stumbled on Five Guys.  I was excited because I have friends in Philly that tout this place.  We headed over at about 2 to let the lunch rush die down--we only had 3 people in front of us but the restaurant was about 75% full.    I ordered the cheeseburger and DH got the bacon cheese burger both \all the way\"".  We each got a small order of fries; mine regular his cajun style.  We were #68; so we got our drinks; sat down and waited (opted out of getting peanuts).  It took less the 5 minutes for our food to be up and boy am I glad we didn't get peanuts.    The burgers were double pattied with sauted shrooms; onions; pickles; lettuce; tomatoe and ketchup and mustard.  The french fries came in small cups but there were at least that many at the bottom of the bag too....no way we would eat all of those.  Next time 1 small order.  I now also understand what a \""little\"" burger is on the menu; it must be one pattie.  The burgers were good; sloppy with all that stuff; but really good flavor.  Glad they were wrapped in foil so I had something to hold it all together with.  The fries were done in peanut oil (I assume).  Not cripsy but I don't think they were supposed to be.  They were good; but the cajun was a bit much.    The price was reasonable just $20 for two big burgers; 2 fries and 2 drinks.  Will definitely go again.""",0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,A lot of bang for your buck... You definitely won't leave this place hungry. For lighter eaters; get a small burger and split the fries... A full order is enough to feed an army!,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,After hearing a bit about Five Guys online; I decided to give them a try.  First impression walking in was very positive.  I liked the decor and the free self-serve peanuts.     Unfortunately; that did not last.  My jaw literally hit the floor when I saw the prices.  Over $5 for a hamburger from a counter-service (i.e. fast-food) restaurant?  Worse yet; I had my three kids with me and Little Cheeseburgers are over $4 each.  I have to say we almost walked out; but I still wanted to try it.   So we proceeded with ordering.   I got the hamburger with french fries.  The hamburger was very good.  No doubt about that.  The french fries were okay; but nothing special.  If the burger would have been $3 - $4; I'd probably say it was one of the best I've had in that price range.  At over $5 though; there are many just as good if not better options.  Bottom line: good food; but way overpriced.,0

A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Man; I guess I just don't get it. I've tried this place twice now; and was unimpressed both times. I really don't understand the excitement over this place.  Just another example of how Eastern transplants to the Phoenix area clamor for anything from \BACK HOME.\"" Plus; this place is way too expensive for an \""Order at the Counter\"" burger joint.  Went in last time with a buddy: 2 REG burgers; 1 REG order of fries to split; NO DRINKS - $17.02 WOW! Not to mention (but I will); that it took over 15 minutes to get my order; when this place was nearly empty!!!  The burger was bland and overcooked. The bacon was burnt and crumbled; not even in strips; but looked like somebody just put some charred bac-o-bits on it. High marks for the freshness of the toppings; but so what. After all; it's not called \""5 Guys Toppings;\"" is it.  And the fries couldn't be worse if you were actually trying to make them BAD. Just a bland; greasy mess. Yuck.  Maybe; if somebody offers to buy me lunch and insists on 5 Guys; I'll give them another shot. Otherwise; NO WAY!""",0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"This was my first experience at a Five Guys. I had heard good things and had no idea that there was a location opening in Ahwatukee until I drove by today and opted to grab some lunch to go. Apparently it opened November 4.  Learn from my mistake - the regular burger is huge. Two patties and heavy \fixins.\"" Unless you are really hungry; the little burger should be plenty for an adult. As far as fast food burgers go; it is one of the best I have had. Definitely better than In and Out. The lettuce; tomato; etc. were fresh; the cheese was quality; and they even offer grilled mushrooms which were super tasty.  The fries; on the other hand; were super greasy and soggy. In the future I will stick to just the burgers.  It was lunchtime and I expected a warzone; but the service was quick and the employees were extremely friendly and helpful.  Definitely worth putting on your fast food burger list.""",1

A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Over priced; waited to long; alittle dirty. Honestly I rather go to in and out to get better service for a better price,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Food was delicious but overpriced. Service was friendly. Their very limited menu did not offer shakes and malts which was disappointing.  Their dinning environment was uncomfortable for such high prices.,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I normally don't write reviews for chain food places; I don't really see the point. They wouldn't be a chain if it didn't appeal to a large number of people.  This place is basically Johnny Rockets without the milk shakes; but with tons of toppings available for free. Value; in terms of pricing; is excellent. The menu is simple and it shouldn't take too long to figure out what you want if its your first time.  While you wait on your order you can work your way to the shelled peanuts which are self-serve and free. This is pretty cool I thought; and unlike Teakwoods; there aren't shells on the floor everywhere.  The toppings. Wow; tons of choices. I went with grilled mushrooms; grilled onions; onions; tomatoes; lettuce; pickles and jalapenos. The tomatoes and jalapenos were sliced too thick in my opinion; way too thick. However; the jalapenos were fresh; and not pickled. They were a little too spicy for me; but it was good. The lettuce wasn't so green; and to be quite honest I don't really remember seeing too much lettuce. Due to the sheer size of the toppings; it becomes a pain in stacking the burger and eating it.  BEEF! I'm a little mixed on how to rate the burger patties. I felt that they were a tad bit too dry for my taste; but that the texture was very interesting; unique; and enjoyable. I hate to bring up Lobby's into this review; but if there is one thing Lobby's does well its their patties. I'm stuck in an awkward situation here. I liked their patties; but I've had better. I'll leave it at that.  Cajun fries. The cajun fries were awesome. Its exactly what it sounds like; fries seasoned with cajun seasoning. Delicious. I ordered a regular; and I must have got two supersized fries instead of one regular. I think it must have been a mistake; because the large brown bag that your order comes in (whether you do dine-in or take-out) was FULL of fries. I tried to finish them all with my 9 year old brother and we couldn't do it; there was just too much. To make the situation worse; we brought home a cup full of fries. This isn't a bad thing; just don't order too much fries or you'll have a ton leftover.  This place is over decorated. Its annoying. Every inch of space is filled with non-local reviews for this place. Are you kidding me? Can you let me decide by myself whether your food is good or not? Of course; this is America and if something is a fashion you have to adhere to the fashion if you wanna be American. But anyways; besides the loads of what amounts to self-praise; the rest of the wall is covered in red and white checkers. Also; there ar not booths; just tables and chairs; which can get a little cramped at times.  Five Guys is a really good burger place; especially if you want a 'diner style' burger for a drive-thru price. You may or may not like the interior; but its a cool place to check out.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Five Guys is so good. Have to admit that the first time I tried them I was not to impressed but on subsequent visits I have grown to really like them. It seems there is a big Five Guys Vs In N Out thing going on but I don't thing you can compare them. they each have there own unique taste. Plus I don't want to choose on over the other. They are both great. Now Five Guys is just a little more expensive but just a little and it is so worth it. Also just a tip unless you really love french fries just order the small because they pile more than enough into the bag. Which is great but why pay for a large when you get enough with a small unless of course you want a ton of fries. I know they have hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches but I haven't been able to get by the burgers yet. They are so good. I get it \all the way\"" except leave off the grilled mushrooms unless I am in the mood for them. Also a warning their regular burgers are doubles so unless you like double burgers make sure you let them know you want a single. But the menu is fairly simple and you can get anything made the way you want it. Also if you want to hang out and eat there they have free peanuts. The staff is always really nice. You can see them make your food and the place is always clean. Just wish it was a little cheeper so I could eat there more often. They also get an extra point because they have a Coke Freestyle machine.""",1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,5 guys has the best burgers that taste so fresh!  Always friendly service and peanuts to munch on as well. If u haven't tried 5 guys ur missing out.,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Service was a bit slow; burger was still great.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I know its a burger place but try the hotdogs.  All items are grilled.    Buns are fresh.  Tons of items to add to your burger/hotdog that are free.  FREE.  No charge.  Fries are awesome.  A sign tells you where the potatoes are from that day.  And they are not cheap with them.  One small is enough for two; sometimes three.  Fast and friendly service.  Somewhat loud; rock music playing; which makes the burger joint experience complete.,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I have gone to this spot a few times now it's always really busy at lunch... It's really loud in the restaurant I found it hard to order. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Toppings A.1.® Steak Sauce; Jalapeno Peppers; Green Peppers; Grilled Onions; Grilled Mushrooms and a order of Five Guys Style Fries. Well you wait for your food to be called you can help yourself to free peanuts. I rate the experience as followed.  Bacon Cheese Burger - B+ Five Guys Style Fries - A+ Staff - C+ Peanuts - A  I like the free peanuts and the fries are some of the best on my list for sure... But the burger I was not blown away by... I am going to have to go back again and see if I can change my mind in the war of the burgers.,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I remember 10 years ago thinking that the Five Guys in Tempe was awesome. I think they had some cache back then for being the only location in Phoenix. The place was always packed with a line out the door. Now they are everywhere. But each location is still always busy. And I just don't get it. Thin greasy patties with no taste whatsoever.  Yes; you can get a bunch of toppings for free but I would rather pay the extra 50¢ or whatever for grilled onions and bbq sauce and get more than five little specs of onion and a teaspoon of sauce. I will say the cajun fries were highly addictive but I did not appreciate having to eat them out of the bottom of the paper bag they were thrown into; even though it wasn't a to-go order. And warning if you get jalepenos on your burger: this is the only topping that they are generous with. Which I would have appreciated if they weren't completely raw.  Not sauteed or grilled; not even pickled in vinegar. Just sliced up raw; complete with the seeds; white membrane; and stem.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,It was our first time eating here. Burgers are really good. Had a little bacon cheeseburger all the way as suggested in the reviews. Loved the mushrooms and it has way more of a homemade taste another burger joints. We got a regular fries; which is big order and had a nice crunch/taste. We will definitely eat there again.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,5 Guys is a notch better than In & Out.  The only thing that worries me is the price of Five Guys.  Thats going to turn a lot of people off.  They need to keep it under $10 for one person ordering a burger; fries and drink.  Great place though.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,LOVE the burgers here & with being on Atkins I can still feel like a NORMAL person and have a burger outside of my own kitchen.  I order mine in a bowl (no bun) and it is sooooooooo good.  Sad I can't enjoy the fries - however when I used to be able to - they were friggen awesome.  A regular size order can feed 3 people - seriously.  Everytime I visit a Five Guys; folks are always nice and the place is clean & in order.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I love the burgers here and the fries are pretty awesome too. 4 stars for the food. I'm hitting the review for 1 star for The one thing I hate; how loud they keep the music. The kitchen adds to the noise level due to having to shout out the orders. You can't hear them call out your orders because all you hear is the music!  News flash to the management; if you turn down the flipping music your kitchen staff wouldn't need to yell over the music. The level of music is most annoying when you're trying to have a conversation with someone and you can't hear each other.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"This is one of my favorite fast-food burgers with a ton of options.  My problem is; everytime I eat here; I end up spending $10 on a burger.  I do enjoy the burger; and granted I do order it \Grilled Cheese\"" style and get 2 patties; but $10 for a fast-food burger is a little much.  I'm afraid I will keep going anyway when I get the urge.  BTW; if you do go here; and you like grilled cheese; do yourself a favor and order the Grilled Cheeseburger.  It's not on the menu; but they will know exactly what you want and probably comment that it is the Best way to order their burgers!""",0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I had heard good things about five guys burgers and fries from several of my friends; but I never made the trek to the location on the mill ave. I figured I would get around to it one day; but didn't think it was worth it to drive 15 miles for a burger. Well; once the hollywood video went out of business and I saw that they were putting a five guys right next to where I work; I decided I had to go and see what all the fuss was about.  I decided that I would get the full experience on my first go; so I got a regular burger all the way (with all the toppings in black). The burger itself was very good; the veggies were crisp and fresh; and the patty juicy. The bread was a little squished; but I guess that's part of the charm (who said burgers are supposed to be pretty anyway? Smashburger I'm looking at you).   I ordered the regular fries and my friend got the cajun. The fries were my least favorite part of the meal; they were too soggy. After getting some advice from a friend; I was told that the frys were soggy because I left them in the bag. Which makes sense; if you leave them in the bag they steam; and the steam condensates on the fries and makes them soggy. So on my next trip I ripped the bag open like a raging hulk and pulled out the cup; and alas; my fries were deliciously crispy! Problem solved. The cajun fries weren't anything to scream about; basically just fries covered in pepper. I would skip them and go for the regular fries. I don't know if the location here offers it; but the five guys in idaho falls has fry sauce; and there's nothing like fry sauce with a big bag full of fries (who doesn't like to mix ketchup with mayonnaise; it's amazing!) :-)  Overall; if I had my choice; I would get a five guys burger and in-n-out fries. That would be perfect. But overall; I think the burgers here are great; and I will be going back. And seeing as how there's always room for improvement; especially considering it's a burger shack that doesn't even offer milk shakes; 4 stars.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Honestly for the price i pay every time i walk in to ANY of the five guys establishments i feel like i am being ripped off.   I am not cheap but i am not out to spend 10+ dollars if i don't feel like A. it will fill me up or B. it is too small and average for the price i am paying.  I understand things might be a little more customizable or \fresh\"" but if you want \""fresh\"" for a Great price just go to in and out or my personal favorite favorite restaurant for burgers/sandwiches is four peaks their food is Good enough for me out here in Arizona. I was born and raised a northern Cali girl so i had it good as far as food goes and i miss it but i have to settle and find what i can out here if i don't end up moving back.    Five guys is cool in my book that you can add stuff but i can add damn near whatever i want at four peaks and i don't feel ripped there.  Every penny is worth it in my book.  Five guys No. Only if there's nothing else close by i haven't tried or if i am too lazy and don't wanna be adventurous and i am starving out of my mind where i just need quick food.  There is another problem with five guys and a reason i don't really go to them often is that there are too many excited people standing in line for this food that isn't mind blowing good for how tiny their burgers are i would rather go to a in and out and pay half the price and be happy with my recent purchase.  Like i said i have lived and traveled all over the world and don't find this place that amazing to wait longer than 10 minutes not including the line just to place your order.   I will pass if i find other places close by which isn't difficult it is not like there's a five guys literally in the middle of the desert with no surrounding places to eat.""",0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Another guest accidentally took my order. After patiently waiting a bit I questioned them on my order and the mix up was discovered. Manager comped my meal for me. Kudos to you Five Guys. Thank you!  Ps love the fries here.,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Very clean; I like clean.    I was afraid of ordering the big burger because I thought it would be something out of man vs food.  I went with the small burger and it didn't disappoint.  The guys I went to lunch with all got the big burger and I have to say; I couldn't tell the difference.  So don't let it scare you like it did me.  All in all it was a very tasty; greasy burger.  Medium fries are more than enough.  I don't particularly care for fries with skin still on though. I liked that they gave you peanuts to snack on while you wait because the wait was a little longer than I would have expected for fast food.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Having tried Five Guys on the East Coast (where they originated) and liking their Burgers; I was very excited at the new location; so close to home.   My first experience was with Fried Onions only. Unfortunately; I believe the onions (which are NOT fried to order) gave the Burger a \chemical taste.\"" The fries have a nice taste but will order them well done in the future; in order to avoid the sogginess.   Not dissuaded by a NOT GREAT experience; my next trip I tried the \""traditional\"" lettuce; tomato and mayonnaise. Very little taste and the Burger; while large enough with two patties; seemed overwhelmed by the mayonnaise. Well done Fries were better than the first.   \""Third time is the charm\"" I thought.   The acid test would be \""pickles and mustard.\"" If the burger was good; it would stand up to this; as do Fudruckers and Steak and Shake. Alas; not to be! The Burgers flavor did not make it through the mustard. Unfortunate; but Five Guys will NOT be on my Burger list in the future.""",0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,THIS PLACE! As much as I like In n Out; this place is even better. The burgers are amazing; and free toppings? Who can complain. I love the fries. Even if you really wanna pig out; the regular order of fries can feed two people. and BULK PEANUTS?! I think yes. They have the Coke Freestyle machine; which is just pure soda bliss. They have malt vinegar up by the ketchup; too. Oh; and I love that the managers work with their employees. Some restaurants you'll never see a manager; but at Five Guys they make sure to see how you're doing; how your food is. Not a freezer in the place; and they say what farm the potatoes are from. It's a really neat and relaxed place.,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I'm a big fan of 5 guys and was excited when a location was opening up near my home.  I'm glad 5 guys has been making their way out west and in the Phoenix area; first in Mesa and Tempe and now in South Phoenix.. I was familiar with them during my trips back to the DC area and always had to \\have one when I was there..  Things I enjoy about 5 guys; the simple menu choices; the topping choices; the free peanuts while you wait for your food and the meat is fresh.  You get a very tasty and high quality burger with the toppings you like.   You also get a ton of fries; even on the small order. A small fry should feed a two people no problem  If you order a cheeseburger; fries and a soda; you are looking at about $11.  This location is always packed! I've been here 3 times since the placed opened at various times and days of the week and there is always a ton of people here. Even with the location; crowded; your food is ready in about 10 minutes.  I just wish the price was a bit cheaper; but worth a treat every so often.,0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Tasty! Very tasty! Ok so I've never been to the East Coast and I'm an Arizona Native so the only comparison for this burger joint is other burger joints in the valley.   The burger is actually a double; you order the toppings individually; and they have the standards. They make it in front of you which is nice. The pattys were tasty and the buns were some of the best on a burger i've ever had!! Fries were good as well.  We ordered two burgers; one side of fries and one drink and the total was $18.xx. Expensive? Well it's more expensive than McDonalds of course but not more than a restaurant; it's a good middle ground. I think you pay for the quality. I definitely don't mind paying extra for a great tasting quality burger!   The decore was......um....interesting. Pretty white everywhere. Peanuts as an appetizer?!? And on the wall was non-local reviews. I rather have local reviews but that's all minor. I went to get a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what I got. I'm happy; and will be returning; probably several times.   FYI-If they had alcohol; they would have gotten 5 stars from me. (It'd be nice for \fast food; sit down joints\"" to take a page out of the Chipotle handbook) umk that's all.""",0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"We have been here a few times now; and when we feel like taking the drive down here; we prefer it to In-N-Out most times. The only thing they don't have that we miss is chocolate shakes. I would love to dunk the fries here into a chocolate shake.   They offer a \veggie burger\"" that is basically all of their condiments on a bun. You can add cheese if you like as well. I think its pretty good and its a nice break from the basic veggie patties you see at most places. They have the best fries here. We like the cajun style the best; and the regular size is plenty for two people. They basically fill up one cup full of fries and put it in the bag; and then dump another full cup in the bag. So you are getting two cups of fries. We never finish them. They are made to order so they are always piping hot. Friendly staff and you can munch on some peanuts before your food comes out.   For two veggie burgers; fries; and two drinks we can get out of here at less than $15. Regular burgers and hot dogs end up costing more so if you are an omnivore it could get a little pricy. But for us vegetarians its a darn good deal.""",1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"This spot just opened; taking the place of a Hollywood Video that closed some time ago.  It's in stealth start-up mode; the staff is still learning and I'll give them a break.  Everything behind the counter was pretty chaotic; but they haven't officially opened and are still working out the bugs.  The burger was good; and I had it with \the works\"" so it was plenty juicy.   It wasn't outstanding; just good.  My teenaged son had his with lettuce; tomato and ketchup and he thought that it was over-rated.  The fries are fresh cut; fried and served in a cup.  Most certainly not crispy; more like greasy.  They actually are kind of limp and; well; icky as they sit in the cup and steam.  Definitely the low point of our visit.  I'm giving it 2 stars for now.  I hope they open strong and improve their product; as I find In-and-Out services a superior burger and fries.  I'll go back in a few months after they work the bugs out.  They have to; or this place will be boarded up again.""",0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I had always loved In n Out; in fact; when I lived in Reno years ago; before they had In n Out; my friends and I would drive 2 hours to Sacramento on a Friday night JUST to get In n Out...   But; since moving to Phoenix; I have to say that Five Guys is really awesome. They take a little time to get your order ready; BECAUSE THEY COOK IT FRESH WHEN YOU ORDER IT. In n Out also takes pretty much that long... I don't know what kind of grill you work on that defies the laws of physics; but it takes a certain amount of time to properly cook meat...  I would give Five Guys a leg up on In n Out BECAUSE they let you decide what's on the burger to a greater extent; they have mushrooms; A-1; and BACON! and the beef just tastes better IMHO. The grease is what makes it great! If you don't want a burger with grease; go buy a Boca burger and choke on it... seriously; because you don't love food if you think that and certainly don't know what you're talking about.  Their fries are pretty damn good and actually TASTE like you're eating a potato! Which is few and far between; TBH.   So; next time you are in the mood for a burger... THIS is the spot.. it's hearty; filling; perfect amount of a juicy; mouthwatering; foodgasm... :-),0
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I wrote a review on another location; so I won't start all over; but I do have to comment on this particular location.  The burger is amazing. Every time I eat here; it is literally the best burger I've ever had. The quality of the meat and ingredients is just sooo darn good. So much better than In N Out Burger; but the same concept.  This location is close to work; so we go here a few times a month. I love love love their easy online ordering and the fact that my order is correct every time. The staff is friendly every time I've picked it up and the wait is minimal with the pre-ordering.  I don't know what else to say; but I love this place and I will be back again and again and again....,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Crazy delicious! Tastes just like my grandma would make on her griddle; grilled onions and all. The fries are by far the best fast food fries I've ever had. You just can't beat them! We always get great service and the place is very clean.,1
A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,The first time I went to 5 guys I hated it but I'm a true believer of 2nd chances.  I ordered the double bacon cheeseburger and wasn't disappointed. I mean; nothing memorable; but a pretty decent taste for a decent price.  The service was really good and the best is the Coke machine that has tons of flavors. Got to love it!,1

A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I like this place a lot; the prices are a little steep is my only complaint really. I love being able to order online and then go pick it up.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Been to the one on South Beach; and the burgers and fries are just as good here!  My only complaint is I asked for ketchup; and they absolutely drenched the burger! (eeew).  After scraping off a 1/4c of ketchup the burger was fantastic; much; much better than In and Out Burger.  I did remember to order the regular fries (which is enough for a family with small children).   The fries here are the BEST!  Nice to see an alternative to In and Out Burger.  I think the burger and fries at Five Guys Rock!,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"They try to be like In-N-Out; even down to the color scheme; but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning; and if you ask for your fries \well done\"" they don't come out as soggy.  But if you're going with someone else; then one order of fries is all you'll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and I'm never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Don't forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying.""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"First time trying Five Guys was here and I was impressed. As someone probably already mentioned; a regular burger actually contains 2x patties; which feels like the size of a double whopper. Couple that with cheese; bacon; and \everything on it\"" and you have a formidable meal to contend with.  The fries are definitely something worth mentioning. For an in-n-out regular; i've become accustomed to stuffing my face with soggy; limp potato ropes. This place has the real deal. An order of regular fries is just a small drinking cup filled with thick; crispy; greasy fries. They load your cup of fries into your take out bag; then top off your bag with even more fries! They must have thought i was pretty hungry; ordering the bacon cheeseburger after all.  Be careful sitting near the back of the restaurant; AT&T reception is pretty bad inside.""",0

jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"There is nothing I love more than a good burger; plain and simple; the way God and America intended it to be; and Five Guys delivers. With the new; trendy \gourmet\"" burger trend sweeping through Scottsdale; a plain old burger was just what the doctor ordered to get me out of my \""goat cheese and grilled pineapple with arugula\"" burger rut. Went today with a pal during lunch time and holy moley; it was CROWDED! You wonder where everyone in Arizona is in the summer? At Five Guys; sheesh! My pal insisted I order the \""little burger\""... and even though I told her I was ravenous; she said; \""no; you want the LITTLE burger\"". Expecting a slider sized burger; I was surprised to see it was completely normal sized; maybe even a bit bigged than an In and Out. I was also pleasently surprised because they say their burgers are \""well-done and juicy\"". I myself; like my burgers still moo-ing. Well; I could barely tell they were well done; and Holy Mary; it was the juiciest burger I had ever had! The fries were hot; fresh; and still had the potato skin on; amazing. It is a little on the pricey side. I should have ordered the small fries; but like I said; I was starving; and ordered the big ones. My friend had a hot dog and it looked pretty good. My fave thing: endless topping INCLUDED! Wahooooo! It is definetly a great place to check out; maybe next time I will just get take out; cause it was a bit crowded. I did love the old fashioned feel; with the potato sacks everywhere and the open kitchen with fry cooks chettering away in their crazy kitchen jargon. Being from Chicago; a lot of places have open kitchens and to me; it is a fun thing to watch the interection and the burger flipping. Great place; go; and you will be happy to have a good; plain; old fashioned BURGER!!! NO GOAT CHEESE; YAY!!!""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,I like Five Guys Burgers a lot; but this one was just OK.  I came here for dinner the other night and ordered:  Little Bacon Cheeseburger w/Grilled Onions; Mustard http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=QkSMzAtjE7aDljIRxLgUfA  Cheese Dog w/Mustard http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=1kvdxxurxO7Xbotp8dDZ1w  Regular Size Cajun Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=3SUu_0EAJIJHhCrduGIaVA  The Bacon Cheeseburger was just OK....I don't know why it was so underwhelming; it just was.  The Cheese Dog was underwhelming too; just didn't hit the spot....it was average.  The only thing above average was the Cajun Fries.....they were excellent!  Not sure if I caught them on a bad day; will have to come back and give them another chance....in the meantime; just 3 Stars for them.  Return Factor - 75%,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,A little busier than the Fashion Square location; but still great food and good service.   Love the fries.,1
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Tried the Bacon Double Cheese Burger topped with lettuce; tomato; pickles; grilled onions; grilled mushrooms; green peppers; and mustard. Also had the Regular Fries  The Good News: The burgers had a nice charbroiled flavor and cooked well as advertised. The cheese and the toppings were tasty and plentiful. I liked idea of crumbled bacon instead of strips. I would agree with the published reviews that their fries are the best I've had at a fast food hamburger franchise. The serving size was also generous and a good deal and I liked eating my fries from the cup; which made it easier to add plenty of ketchup the way I like. Enjoyed munching on the free peanuts while we waited for our order. Service was quick and pleasant. Their drink dispenser; what I have decided to call a \Coke Replicator\""; was cool.  The Rest of the Story: The burgers were not juicy as advertised and; therefore; not as flavorful as some other fast food franchise hamburgers. The bacon on my burger was overcooked and; therefore; did not add as much flavor to the sandwich as I would like. The green peppers would have been better grilled like the other toppings. The bun was rather limp and not what I would have expected from a place like this.  The Verdict: The most important reason for going to burger joint is to enjoy a juicy; flavorful hamburger and that was not achieved. The fries compensated a lot; but not enough to make it a truly memorable experience. I do intend to try at least one more location.""",1

jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Just tried Five Guys for the first time today. I ordered a hamburger which comes with 2 patties. I don't like a lot on my burger so I got mayo; ketchup; and lettuce. The lettuce was too warm so I could have done without that. But the burger was ok. I also tried their french fries and they were too cooked for my liking and also very salty. I think I would go back again but I would order the little burger which I hope is just one patty.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Finally; a burger joint that really takes the pain out of waiting in line. This was my first visit to Five Guys and I did an online web order just to see how well it would work; and how accurate and timely it would be.  By the time I got there; there was a line to the door. I was a little early so I figured I would not press the issue of timeliness too much; but I did tell them that I had a web order. My wait time was very short; just ebough time for the swift kitchen team to whip up and cook the freshly cut fries.  The burgers were unbelievable. What's nice is that you can pre-order unlimited toppings from the website. I somewhat expected a burger 10 inches high as I ordered mine nearly all the way. However; to my surprise it was fairly compact in an foil housing and quite edible and definitely not as messy as I expected.  The fries; while freshly cut; were nothing to rave about and were not quite well done enough. A little crispier would have given them the ultimate competitive edge. I was very satisfied with my choice of the little bacon cheeseburger and in fact; I ordered another one from my phone while sitting down. That little juicy beast was ready in no time. I know it was proably not the best way to make friends with the people who were waiting in line. I ordered the burger at 6:47 pm from my phone and it was ready exactly as promised at 6:54 pm. I could not believe it and on top of that; the kitchen was slammed!  The only item missing from the menu is a milshake actually!   The staff was very courteous; friendly and efficient and the whole restaurant was spotless as far as cleanliness goes.  If you have a craving for a juicy burger; I highly recommend Five Guys at the Zocallo Plaza in Scottdale. If you are in a hurry; you really cannot beat the online ordering system and your stomach will thank you and think you're a hero!  There's even salted peanuts in the shell if you are still hungry afterwards wa ha ha!,1
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Great burger! Love the fact that you have so many  add on options for your 1 or 2 patty burger. The fries are good too... You can actually taste the potato; not just oil and salt. Overall with fries and a drink the cost for lunch is $10.00+ so it's not the cheapest place to grab lunch but I would have to say it's worth it.   I've been to this site a few times and have had great service everytime.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Love this place.  The hamburger and fries are fresh...and custom made to your order.  The food is nice and hot right off the grill.  The service is always pleasant.  This is a \eat and leave\"" type of location; not a lounging and eating location.  Great food.""",1

jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Ordered takeout; ala the Bacon Cheeseburger; \all the way\"" with some Cajun fries. I guess it's MY fault for not checking my Bacon Cheeseburger for the G.D. BACON before I left!!!   I am sorry Five Guys; but no matter how fresh your 'taters are; no matter how cool it is to crack peanuts in line; no matter how good my burger was; sans pig; you can't forget a basic function like putting the BACON ON A BACON CHEESEBURGER. Yes I checked the receipt.   Probably the same reason your bathrooms were filthy. Wifey said it looked there was a diaper party for two year-olds and hobos in the ladies room. She couldn't use it and didn't tell me 'til home because she knew I would have publicly embarrassed you in front of your potatoes and peanuts. You owe her... really.   My baconless leftovers went in the trash after I learned about the bathroom. Permanently disgusted and won't go back.""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Five Guys versus In-N-Out Burger - the competition is on.   Five Guys is a terrific burger and fries chain that started back east and has continued to branch out over the USA. It's only recently hit AZ. Word spread quickly and Five Guys has become a phenomenal success around here. If you want to spark a lively discussion; ask someone which they prefer: Five Guys or In-N-Out. It's an East Coast versus West Coast thing; yo. LOL   Five Guys serves two sizes of burgers. The \little burger\"" is the size of a normal burger. Their \""regular\"" burger is actually TWO patties. Not realizing this; on my first visit; I ordered the regular size. I couldn't finish it; so it must really be big. When you place your order; you tell them what you want on your burger. Of course they offer the usual cheese and condiments; but they offer other choices too. Almost anything you want: bacon; grilled onions; grilled mushrooms; jalapenos; BBQ sauce and more.   Their fries are good too; thickly cut and well-seasoned. They serve them in a brown paper bag. I like to add a salt packet to the whole bag and shake it around before spreading the fries out on the table. I prefer my fries a bit overdone; so when ordering I ask for them to be prepared extra crispy. Really good.   I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on their brand new soda dispensing machine. I've never seen anything like it. (see pic) It's only got one actual dispenser; but you press the computer screen to select your beverage choice. Then it offers you the choice of adding special flavoring like lemon; vanilla; power boost; etc. The employee guys in the back said it's an urban legend that if you punch in a secret code of ingredients; then alcohol is dispensed. Pretty funny.""",1
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,5 stars for burgers 2 for service. Ate at 5 Guys in Orlando after hearing about it from all people; President Obama. I love me a good burger. They are delish here! They just opened in the Phx area. I love their food but the wait was horrid. Extra horrid! They also have no seating. You have to go out in the mall; which was packed.  The service wasn't that great but I do love their hamurgers! YUMMY! They do have a few other locations opening up in Downtown and North Phoenix so I will try them out. They might be less crowded.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,I like 5 Guys' burgers.  They make them to order.  The fries are a bit over rated.  They tend to get soggy if you don't eat them right away; like right when you get them and  before you eat your burger.  Mostly I think people rave about these fries because you get so many.  I'd recommend the burgers; but pass on the fries unless you're planning on sharing them and eating them fast.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"The first time I ever had Five Guys was at the Reagan Airport.  I didn't get to it until an hour later and it was still delicious.  Been to this location twice and every time going there hits the spot.  Sharing a medium order of fries with a friend is PLENTY and their mini-sized burgers are just right.  Guys will probably like the \regular\"" ones since they come with two patties.  My husband was skeptical when I took him to this place but now he requests it ... and we have to drive to Scottsdale all the way from Buckeye!""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Took my Dad; brother; and nephew here since they are from out of town and never heard of this place. The restaurant was clean and even though there was a line; it moved quickly. Staff was on their game (I'm a chef so I look for that sort of thing). We got double bacon cheesebugers and both types of fries. The burgers were juicy and had lots of flavor; but for some reason I'm still partial to Carl's Jr.or; better yet; a burger from Delux. The fries are very good. Hand cut and skin on; these babies are quickly blanched in oil; cooled; and then fried to order; I had the Cajun and while nice and crispy; I could have used a. Bit more heat and cajun flavor. All in all; I give this place a thumbs up and will be back.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Ummm okay so this is the most amazing; yummy; place for burgers. If you have never eaten a burger here you will bite into your perfectly made meal; put it down; and tell your friend through garbled words that it's the best burger you've ever had.   Everything is fresh and they offer a ton of toppings. You can get regular fries or cajun flavored. I find Cajun flavored a must since you can't get it anywhere else and the regular frieds are kind of plain; although they are seasoned with salt.   Only problem is this food is really; really high in calories (duh) but it's worth it. Just don't eat and feel guilty about it. Enjoy it.  If you don't want a burger they do have hot dogs and grilled cheese. Both look good. Also; the way the soda machine words is cool and the soda tastes really delicious.   Service is great. I've walked in at 9:50 starving and apologizing for coming in so late and the staff reassured me I was fine. That says something -- although what exactly I couldn't tell you.  There menu is basic and they don't have milkshakes. Some think it's expensive and it is for a \fast food burger\"" -- like $6.00 before drinks or fries -- but the quality is the cause for the price difference.""",1
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Everyone calls this the back east in n out Burger. I thought it was a very good burger a little more than in n out but worth it. Fries are good and they give you A LOT of them in the small order.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Wanted to see what all of the hype was about so I ordered online for pick up.  Arrived to an unorganized place with staff not very engaged in what they were doing after waiting for eye contact at the pickup counter; it was learned that my order was lost and so I got to wait 20 minutes for my order.  Staff unapologetic and really just slinging overpriced burgers. Got 3 burgers and 3 fries was about $35.  Burgers were okay not great kind of thin; in and Out and Carls Jr better for sure.  I will not be back.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Being that I work across the street I felt like I had to come check it out; even though I've had bad experiences at other 5 guy locations. I actually was entertained by the energy the people working had. They were all dancing around to music while making food and looked like they we're having a good time. I decided to order the veggie sandwich ; since I broke and that's the cheapest/healthier choice on the menu. It was really good!!!! Like a boss cheese sandwich it came with sautéed onions; mushrooms; tomatoes; lettuce and American cheese.  The only reason I give this place 4/5 was because their tomatoes weren't ripe.  Definitely coming back for that sandwich though; even with a jimmy johns next door. Lol,1
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,I was severely disappointed by my experience at Five Guys.  With all the hype that this chain has garnered; I found that little of it held up.  As soon as I walked in the door I was overwhelmed by the smell of smoke that the griddle was wafting through the restaurant.  There were plenty of people cooking and preparing the food; yet it all looked chaotic and unorganized.  Just as other people have mentioned; you can choose a whole array of toppings to customize your burger.  That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly (which mine was not).  Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.  Along with my burger; I also ordered the regular-sized Cajun fries.  These were definitely fully-seasoned; so if you are averse to spice don't order them.  The regular order of fries turned out to be a modest cup of fries stuffed in a brown bag full of more fries.  It is almost as if Five Guys' strategy is to overwhelm you by their generosity with their fries; so that you forget that their burger is mediocre and their fries are sopping wet with grease.    The AYCE peanuts were good though; it is a shame that these were the highlight of the meal.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"A friend told us about the awesomeness of Five Guys food. We were in the mood for a good burger so went to this location to try it out. I like the simplicity of the menu; it's just a burger place. It's also extremely greasy... makes a good burger but also makes you want to immediately change your clothes - no going out after you walk into this place. We decided to get our food to go for this reason. We ordered 2 cheese burgers and fries.  The burger was delicious - greasy and moist... like a good burger should be. The fries - Meh. We were expecting better fries especially with all the signs about how good they were; perhaps the spiced ones were better. They needed something more... or less. More seasonings or just less potato. We dipped them into steak sauce; ketchup and ranch and still just \meh\"".  So if you are looking for a good burger - def. go here but perhaps skip the fries.""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"This place is sooo conveniently close to my office... it's hard not to go to often. But; as other reviewers have stated its a little pricey for a \fast food\"" style burger joint. Granted that this is NO McDonalds!! But... In and Out is not far away either... and they are pretty damn good too! This is a place I come 2 -3 times a month... more than that and you will need to see your doctor and have them check the cholesterol!   I love the burgers here. They are huge; delicious; and fresh. Be careful ordering the larger order of fires... as they are huge! And you can get them with Cajun seasoning.    One thing I absolutely love... as I am a gadget guy; and \""buttons\"" make me happy... is the soft drink dispenser!!! It is uber-cool.... and hard not to play with!""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"I have to say I am a little picky when it comes to fast food burger places.  My husband had been to Five Guys many times and kept asking me to try it.  I finally agreed and was not disappointed.   They burgers are great.  Lean ; fresh; meat; not frozen and most importantly NOT SALTY!!   Most burger places rain salt on their burgers; not so at Five Guys.   In fact I even asked for my burger \not seasoned\"" and the cashier explained they do not season their burgers.  You can get as much of any topping for no extra charge.   Customize it any way you like.   The orders always come out accurate.   Fries are great and always come out hot and fresh.   I have been here several times and will continue to go back.   Give them a try.""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"I needed a salad; but I saw that the Five Guys in my neighborhood had opened so I got a whole lot of greasy goodness.  I'm a fan.  They give you an unlimited amount of shell peanuts for free to snack on while you're waiting for your food.  Nice touch.  The regular burger is actually 2 patties that are 1/3 pound each.  So if you get the regular burger you're eating well over a half pound of meat.  I would rather be a wimp and order their \Little Burger\"" which is still a huge bun and a nice 1/3 pound pattie.  The burger and fries come served in a paper bag (grease stains are free).  The burger comes in foil wrap and the fries come in a paper cup.  After they put the burger and fries in the bag; they create what they call \""a topper\"" by placing a whole order; or so; of more fries on top of everything else. So when you order a small fries; you're really getting one huge order due to the topper.  The fun part is that because of all those extra fries you can't even get your burger out of the bag!  I noticed one customer ripped his bag down the side.  I managed to scoot the topper fries to one side and I somehow managed to squeeze the burger out of the bag.  Too much food.  I couldn't even finish it all.  At first I thought it was pricey; but when I got the food I realized it's a good deal.  Another nice touch is that the burger toppings are all free with no extra charge for grilled onions or grilled mushrooms.  NICE.  Finally; (and this part I love) they have ample amounts of malt vinegar for the fries.  I ADORE vinegar on my fries and these are the kind of fries that say \""pour malt vinegar on me and dip me in ketchup\"".  Welcome to town FIVE GUYS.""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,We wanted a burger today so we decided to try Five Guys. My daughter recommended this place so here we are. The service was friendly and prompt. I ordered the cheese burger which is really a double cheese burger. If you I want the single then order the lite. I like the concept of ordering your toppings. They have a nice selections of topping including grilled mushrooms and Jalapeños. Burger were very juicy and tasty. The fries are good and fresh. They put your fries in a cup and then add extra by just dumping them in your bag.  We sat outside cause it was a really nice day. I was impressed cause the place was very clean inside; outside; and the bathroom. They even had people wiping down the tables outside. Expensive burger for $6.59 each but worth it every once in awhile.,0

We go to Five Guys a couple of times a  year because their hamburgers are awesome and their fries are outstanding. The burgers are just the way I like them - greasy and dripping with fat. The only toppings I put on are sliced onions and cheese. The fries are tasty and very salty (in a good way - at least for me). They have a state-of-the-art soda machine that takes some getting used to; I never saw this type anywhere else. Haven't had their hot dogs yet; so that's next. The staff is friendly and the service top notch. I highly recommend Five Guys for your next burger.""",1
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Meaty; beaty; big and bouncy!  Add \beefy\"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!  After detoxing this morning; I was really hungry...after all; I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal; you're going to need some retoxing!  And since it's Taco Tuesday; I thought a burger fest sounded about right!  I needed to be up north anyway; so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready; hot and juicy when I rolled in.  The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know; when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when; they consistently screw up your order and figuratively; literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).  The burgers are OK; the fries are fresh and peanutty (no; really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!); and the Coke is; well; Cokey.   The atmosphere is nice enough; all red and white checked and tons of \""look at me\"" crap on the walls (\""Best Fries in Hoboken!\"")  The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...\""I come from a land down under\""...I shuddered a little bit at the part \""and men chunder\""...please; no chundering while I'm eating!).  Anyway...  I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).  I know; Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!  I'm no spendthrift; but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.  But; 5GB&F filled me up; they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again; how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you \""accidentally\"" ride over a cliff on your Segway; that's what happens!)   And; in a nostalgic sort of way; they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music); and for that; a reasonable 3.25 stars.""",0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Intended to go to Chipotle next door; but had to try Five Guys. Being a newbie; I asked the cashiers what a good first time meal is. A friend was with me; and we ended up both ordering a cheeseburger; fries and a soda each. While the fries were great; the cashiers failed to tell us the fries could have been split between three people. Burger was as good as any cooked on a flat top. While In-n-out remains this west coaster's favorite; Five Guys stays on the list for when that afternoon food coma is oh so necessary.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,On occasion; only a big; fat; messy greasefest will do.  An evil greasefest of deliciousness.  I like a greasy burger.  Five Guys pretty much redefined the experience for me.  Ordered what I thought would be a good cheeseburger; and got this 2-patty behemoth with 2 slices of american cheese so greasy the top of the bun was shiny.  Add grilled onions and fries cooked in peanut oil; and my heart started waving a tiny white flag even whily my taste buds were doing their happy dance.  As I was fighting to keep my eyes open on the way home I think I heard my son say he just grew a new chin.  At about $10 a person; I only wish it weren't so expensive.  It is just a burger joint; after all.  But they gotta pay for the new building with Scottsdale Rd. frontage rent and seven (seven! like clowns in a car back there!) staff behind the counter somehow.  And it really is a killer burger.  Time for nap.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,My parents told me about Five Guys back East a few years ago. So; when they came here to the Valley; well...  we had to try it.   First off; the peanuts are a great idea.   The staggered circular line is a great idea. It's these little things that you first notice as you come through the door.   BTW; we also like the food!    The idea of a Little Hamburger (one patty) and a large Hamburger (two patties) works very well.  What doesn't work as well is the pricing of the Pop and French Fries...   I've read other reviews of different restaurants over the years and I have always felt the discussion of pricing to be a little..  well; petty.    Okay; so now I've broken one of my rules; but... don't get me wrong; the fries are delicious ; but $5.00? Come on.  I know in the restaurant industry they make their money;  their profit margins on the soda and side items they sell; but do you need to be so obvious about it?    So in summary; I would say great food at a premium price which works most of the time.  Will we come back; yes.  Will we order fries; well sometimes.  Here is the real question...      are they better than In-N-Out?    Umm; maybe.  Enjoy!,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Sometimes I crave a big; juicy burger.  On a recent Friday; a few co-workers and I went to Five Guys to get our dose of beefy goodness.  The menu is simple - burgers; hot dogs and fries.  One thing that is important to know is that the regular burgers come with two patties; while the 'little' burgers come with one.  Convinced (or perhaps challenged) by my co-workers to try the full-size; I went with the cheeseburger.  From the long list of toppings (all free) I chose to go 'all the way' except for the tomato which meant mayo; mustard; ketchup; lettuce; pickles;  grilled onions and mushrooms.  The burger was pretty good - juicy and messy.  I think I should have skipped the grilled onions; though; as there were far too many of them.  The fries come in two sizes (big and huge) and two ways - regular and cajun.  We shared a large order of cajun fries among the three of us; and I think it would have taken two more people to finish them.  The fries were thick-cut; which I really like; but the cajun seasoning made them very salty.  All orders are served up in plain brown paper bags; even if you are not taking the food to-go.  A cute idea; except that the brown paper really soaks up that french fry grease.  I know burgers & fries are greasy.  Duh.  I just don't want to have such obvious visual confirmation of that.  The shiny glistening sheen that had soaked through the brown paper bag was NOT what I wanted to see after finishing my meal.  Overall a tasty burger; and so-so fries.  Would I have the burger again?  Sure.  However; Five Guys will not replace In-N-Out as my go-to place to satisfy my burger cravings.  Yes; I will always be a California girl at heart!,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,I was driving up Scottsdale Rd. on the way to my one guilty pleasure that I have In-and-Out; to have my once a month double double.  I looked up and saw the 5 guys sign; made a quick turn; and decided to go there instead after hearing how great this place was from my East Coast friends. I Had the regular burger (two patty's) and my wife had the small burger (1 patty) we split a large order of Cajun fries (huge portion) and each had a soda.  Set us back about $20.  Loved the variety of toppings we could put our burgers; loved the free peanuts; loved the variety of diet drinks from the soda machine (ordering a diet drink at place like this is a little twisted when you think about it) although they had run out of a couple of the varieties.  Did not like or dislike the Cajun fries after a few I had had enough. Only thing I did not like is the price.  If I had gone to In-and-Out I would have had a meal I would have enjoyed just as much but would have ended up with about $8 more in my pocket which is why Five Guys will not replace In-Ad-Out as my once a month guilty pleasure.,0
jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,I was told that this place had one of the best burgers in town. Yesterday; I waited for 56 minutes for my burger and fries...56 minutes! And the burger was average; not the best.  I could have  a gourmet lunch in 56 minutes.   You don't put 1 register and 3 guys behind the counter between 12 and 1. You put 2 registers; 6 guys when it's busy.  Service was horrible. Wait was unforgivable and the burger was actually over done and very thin.  Disappointed; again!  Where is the real burger; real service? Please !!!!!,0
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,I would definitely give them a try. I got the large shrimp po'boy and I was stuffed. The fries were hot and fresh and the sandwich was tasty. I tried my aunt's rice and beans and they were really good unlike what I expected from the other reviews I read. The people were very nice and the lunch prices were good. Dinner is more money but maybe they increase the portion size. I'm not sure. Also they give a 20% military discount on the whole order and my aunt has a military I.d. So that worked out. I'd go again for sure.,1
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,this place is bomb diggity; it is a family favorite and a quick delicious dinner night option; the staff is always friendly; and more than half the time our order comes with little extras in the bag; don't be scared by prices as each order comes a la mode; we feel their chicken rivals only Lo-Lo's in town; beware as the locals will tell you; it is more of a call it in place; but be sure to try some lemon cake!,1
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,I came a while back maybe in November; and was craving some chicken. I knew the name sounded familiar; because I went to a Louisiana Fried Chicken out in California. I knew the menu was gonna be different because they are separately owned franchises. However; the food was still on point.   I got the chicken tenders; fries and a drink REAL SIMPLE.  The chicken was hot and spicy very good; and the service was pretty quick took less than 10 minutes there was a good amount of ppl waiting inside as well as outside chilling outside.   I def would go back here over popeyes or churches!   4 STARS,0
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,The two best things at this chicken joint did not include the chicken. The sweet corn nuggets; basically a tiny corn fritter; and the cup of red hot sauce were the show stoppers. I really only like breasts and somehow this dude screwed up my phone order. I just wanted two breasts; but ended up with one breast; a wing; thigh and drumstick. Regardless; the piece I ate was semi-crunchy; but didn't really make any memories for me. If you dipped the chicken in that hot sauce though; it made things much tastier. The roll was a roll and the dirty rice was pretty average with some nuggets of ground beef or sausage running through the rice. The whole meal was only $8; so its a good price; but not a top 10 fried chicken in my book.,0
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,Best fried chicken so far in the Phoenix area... Great customer service; you can't go wrong.,1
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,"I've been to this location several times and I really do enjoy the food. the chicken is always crunchy and spicy. The fries are seasoned with season salt. The rolls that come with the meal are decent considering they are store bought. The catfish and shrimp appear and taste to have the same spicy batter as the chicken. This place is super small so don't expect to eat here; it's a takeout place. There are  two small tables inside and two outside but I highly doubt you can get a seat. I highly recommend phoning your order ahead of time and then picking it up because it can get crowded and the service can be painfully slow. \like\"" them on Facebook to get insider offers.""",0

M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,Back in March; I Ordered to go. I ordered the Value Pac #5 that comes with 8 pcs. (2 each) + 6 Rolls; Fries or Rice and a large coleslaw. Instead of 8 pcs (2each) I received 9 pieces; 1 breast; 2 wings; 3 legs; 3 thighs; the rolls were hard on the outside; the coleslaw was too sweet; the rice was good. The wings were huge; makes me think they purchase factory farm chickens instead of local farm chickens. The coating of the chicken tasted like it had been under the hot lamp for hours. The Cajun flavor itself was good however the coating was like a separate entity to the chicken. I would not go there again.,0
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,LOVE this place.  The spicy fried chicken and catfish are delicious; the fresh made sides are equally so; especially the fried okra. I haven't tried the Peach Cobbler yet; because if it's as good as the chicken I may end up there every day.  The  food is SO much better than other fast food chicken options.  The location is clean and the staff is friendly.  The truest mark of their customer service was when I asked for a one piece thigh combo. The thighs they had were on the small side; so they gave me 2.  I go to the Location In Arcadia; on Thomas and 40th St; in between the theater and Walmart.  If you like chicken; check this place out!,1
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,There are very few foods I crave as comfort food splurges more than Fried Chicken or Pizza.  I had been wanting fried chicken for a few days and Friday afternoon thru Saturday evening are my splurge days.  Wanting to try something new and different ( I usually end up at Churches) I turned to my trusty Yelp app.    I hopped in my car and drove south to a shopping center on Baseline and 20th Street.  It is a small shop with just a few tables for dine-in.  One person was waiting ahead of me and as I placed my order; the fryer timer went off.  The guy who took my order then politely excused himself  and scrambled to the back kitchen area in response to the timer.   Poor guy was the only one here at the store today.  Forced to work the register and the fryers; but he was handling it well.  He was very polite and provided great service.  (4 Stars for service)  I ordered a 10 piece Shrimp and Fries and an 8 piece chicken (only chicken).    My order was prepared right then after ordering.  Makes all the difference in the world when it comes to fried foods.  Taking my order to go; I dug into the fries on the way home (you have to enjoy them while they are hot right?) They were awesome.  The shrimp were intermingled with the hot fries and both had been well seasoned with a spicy cajun salt.  Hot; salty (in a good way) and perfectly spicy.  Once home I enjoyed the shrimp with their spicy southern fried coating (not a thick dry breading).   I would absolutely go back just for the shrimp and fries.  As for the chicken it was just ok.  I didn't find it any better than fried chicken I can get at the grocery deli.  For me I still prefer Churches Chicken but wouldn't rule the chicken out here completely.  (3 Stars for the Chicken)  In the future I would love to try their chicken tenders or nuggets and will absolutely go back for the shrimp.,1

M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,Inspiring food. Shallow selection; inefficient service and tiny operating space on par with a bathroom; but if the smell pulls you in you'll be up against a crowd hungry for the same thing.   They're worth the hassle and the fact that you'll be shoulder to shoulder with a fire code violating amount of folks at any time; but it'll be worth it. If they could work out their efficiency issues they'd get the five stars from me.  Not a good place to stay and eat; expect to make a to-go order.,0

M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,I work about 3 miles from this place; and after passing by it numerous times (and being a huge fan of chicken) I tried it out for the first time last year. In all; I've probably eaten here 4-5 times.  The chicken itself is very tasty! The breading is spicy and flavorful and the chicken itself is juicy and tender. The fries are OK; I'm more of a crunchy fry person and more often than not mine seem to come out mildly soggy.  Customer service is nice; the staff is pleasant despite working in such small quarters (behind the counter is TINY) with each other. It takes awhile for the food to cook though; so if you're going when you're on a time budget; like lunch hour at work; I recommend calling your order ahead by 10-20 minutes.,1

M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,I love this place! We have to drive over the mountain to get to it so we do not get there as much as we would like but every time we eat here it is soooo good! There is no other great fried chicken place on this side of the valley. It is spicy and juicy and tender. The sides are good too. Peach cobbler and Sweet potato pie; lemon cake; pecan pie. Can you tell I like sweets? The dirty rice and coleslaw; even the fires are all reallllly good. We took my mom with us this time because she said she was craving some good fried chicken.  Her wish was granted. This is a family owned business and they really care.  Spend your dollars with local companies. More money stays in the state that way. This is one little out of the way place you will love. It is made mostly for To Go orders but we usually eat there while it is fresh since the drive is a bit long from Ahwatukee,1
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,This little place just opened in a strip mall and you'd probably miss it if you didn't know it was there. Fortunately; I knew thanks to a well-timed coupon arriving in the mail.  The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings. I had coleslaw and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides and they were great. The gravy had just the right kick and the coleslaw was among the best I've ever tasted.  They also carry fried shrimp which I'll be back to try and they have many other sides including fried okra for those with the stomach for such things.  Friendly; helpful; and quick counter service in this to-go-only restaurant. It's small; but it has a big heart. It's part of a chain of restaurants; but this is the only one in Arizona so far. Here's hoping it's not the last!,1
M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,The chicken is wonderful. You get quick service with a smile. Sometimes it can be over cooked but just take it back and they will recook u some chicken. The chicken and dirty rice is what I love most. Keep in mind you cant have a large family here the lobby is quite small. Only three tables inside and about 4 chairs. Their are like 2 tables outside so I would  do takeout only when trying to feed 8 to 12 people.,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Fast service and super good food! I've eaten here twice and both times the food came out pretty fast! Super clean and surprisingly big inside! I love the soda choices how there is so many! Clean bathrooms which is a huge plus for a mall! Super yummy food! Worth the money and they definitely give you a lot of fries for one meal so you definitely can share the food here!,1
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Great burgers; excellent service and a shovelful of fries...all at a great price.   What's not to love?,1
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Woah.    What just happened? I've never heard of this place other then seeing it next to the Jimmy John's sub shop in Tempe and thought it was a local chain. I went to the movies at the mall this past Saturday (X-men: First Class; was amazing btw!) and saw Five Guys Burgers in the food court.   I really felt like a burger and everything in that food court is kinda gross so I decided to give it a shot.   Back to my Woah.....how did I never hear of this place? For a quick cheap burger fix...this is the place. I hear all the comparison to in and out but honestly I dont see it....this place is better. Dont get me wrong; In and out has good burgers that hit the spot...but this place has amazing burgers that have customizable options AND fries to boot....and please dont say you like the fries at in and out....because they are plain bad.   These fries are large cut and freshly made that get just the right amount of seasoning on them. Delicious!!!   I've also read a couple reviews that mention price and I do have to agree....I'm taking 1 star away for value. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger and fries with NO drink and my total was like 11$...that is a little much for a quick fix burger joint. I dont know if prices are like this at the mall location only because rent is probably higher but I'll check out the Tempe location soon enough and find out.   All in all im very pleasantly surprised that there is a decent quick fix burger option out there other then in and out and smash burger.,1
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,I absoluetly do not eat hamburgers out if we ever go to a burger place i always order chicken sandwhiches but i decided to give this place a try and OH WOW it was so goooood everything is fresh the fires are great mmm will def go again and again and again,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"Things I know about Five Guys:  1. They displaced In & Out on Zagats; 2. According to my husband; one order of fries can feed three people; 3. According to a good friend (who shall remain anonymous) \Yeah; it's good; but I can eat at In & Out for half the price.\""  I agree with all three.   I went to the food court for lunch after a fine time at Nordstrom with the express desire to have a chicken caesar at Ranch One Chicken; but they were gone (I don't get to this mall very often). So; after looking around I decided to try Five Guys to see what all the hype was about. When I left; I felt robbed.  Yeah; the food was fine. Not brilliant by burger standards; but fine. I threw away about half the fries because; generous though the serving was; I was by myself and didn't need to feed three people. They also had an incredibly cool soda machine with loads of flavors but it was on the seltzery side. And throughout the afternoon I couldn't shake my frustration over the amount of money I'd spent.  If I want to spend that kind of money; I'll go to Fez.""",0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"I was pretty excited to try Five Guys after reading up on the buzz all over the 'net.  Zagat is practially in bed with 'em and practically every town/city newspaper thinks they're the next best thing; according to their decor.  What I mean is that their place is literally plastered with praises given to Five Guys by different publications.  As I stood waiting for my food; I really came to hate their decor.  I can understand \Best of Phoenix\"" plaques and maybe a framed newspaper review; but every inch of the place covered with quotes of how great their food was... kind of made me a hater.  I missed In-N-Out.  Maybe it was because it was so hyped; but I was seriously underwhelmed by their food.  I paid over twelve dollars for a bacon cheeseburger; smallest fries; and smallest drink.  I started to doubt the quotes on the walls since \""Best Value\"" seemed to be the wording on several of them.  Now; the burger.  Let me start out by saying I really really really like burgers.... I can't really say this or that place is best; because I seriously like alllll of them.  Whether it be the super-processed flavor of McDonald's to the flamed-broiled goodness that is Burger King; or even the super fresh taste of In-N-Out;  I love burgers.  I love how not every burger tastes the same.  I looove burgers.  I don't think there has been a burger I haven't finished.  However; I literally had a moment to myself where I thought to myself I didn't want to finish this.  It was a fleeting thought; but that shocked me.  It was that tasteless.   Whenever I create an opinion on ANYTHING; I like to do the research and try it out before creating my own.  Every single bite; I was trying to find the great-awesome-spectacular-best-of-(insert city)-awesome-value-better-than-In-N-Out-burger taste everyone was talking about on the 'net.  I could not find it.  T.T  I ordered it with \""Everything\"" and everything was bleh.    But don't hate me.  Like I said; I really like to do the research and try things out before I cement my opinion on something.  Sooooooo; I'm giving Five Guys 1 Star this time around for their underwhelming; super-overpriced burger.  However; I will go back once or twice because I love burgers and I like to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe the guy behind the grill forgot to season my patty?  Maybe my tastebuds took the day off?  Stay tuned for my updated review of Five Guys!""",0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,CONSISTENT QUALITY  I wasn't exactly overwhelmed and felt a little cheated by my re-visit to Chino Bandido. So while walking around Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall; I couldn't resist ordering a double cheeseburger with mayo and steak sauce plus grilled onions that would tie me over for dinner.  As it turns out Korean dinner wasn't anything to write home about.  The one thing I did notice different about this FGB&F is no peanuts to have while waiting for my order. What's up with that ?  One thing can be said is that their burgers are of consistent quality no matter which store. Like others; the place neat and super clean.,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Been hearing about the place.  Walked in every table was dirty so I had to set outside.  The guy at the register cared less that I was there.    Burger; Fry and a drink. $14.11!!!!  Really!!!  Call your number and it's pilled in a brown bag with all the grease leaking threw.  Was so appetizing to get.  Burger like a drive in; fries terrible. #Sorrywontbebackever  I can go to any Old Town restaurant and get a quality burger with service for the same money.,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.  Another excellent burger; I have to say! Plenty of meat; freshly made - and hot off the grill!  Top notch fries as well; overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great; fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,This was my first time eating at Five Guys. As soon as I walked in; I was greeted and asked for my order. The wait time was under 10 minutes; so that was a plus. The atmosphere was also great because I felt welcomed. All of the workers were kind and seemed like they were happy to be at work. I received excellent customer service overall.  After I got my soft drink from the fountain; which was also a cool experience because it was different from any other soft drink fountain I've seen; I sat down and prepared to enjoy my food. I can easily say it was one of the best burgers I've eaten. The french fries were also delicious and everything just felt comfortable. I felt like I was eating at a local burger joint rather than a franchise. My meal came out to around $11; which wasn't bad at all for the quality. Definitely going back soon!,1

jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,1st time at this 5-Guys location; never had a complaint about their other Scottsdale location; so thought it was safe to order take-out from this Fashion Square location; WRONG my regular burger was the worst non-meat burger I have had from anywhere in the past year; the meat was no where to be found ! probably less that 1/10th pound !!! if I wasn't already at home eating this it would of been brought to the managers attention; I managed to eat 1/2 of it then why waste my time because all the meat was gone already; maybe this was a fluke & someone only put 1/3 of the meat in ? I will never go back to this location again; as a heads up to anyone take the time when you are handed your order & take a look at the burger & contents to be sure you are receiving what your paying for.  I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,A burger? With anything I want? FINE....I'll do it.  I need no convincing for a burger; fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.)   Earleir this afternoon; after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors; I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.  I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?  It was PACKED! But I digress.  As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall; you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)  You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.  Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!  My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions; tomatoes; etc.   The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school; when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft; perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.  Oh; I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!!   (I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon; since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).  Ultimately; I left this place happy; satisfied and I will come back again.  Oh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind? YES; BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Very good hamburger made from meat that was packed into a patty on site (or at least it looks that way).  Bun was lightly toasted too.  I do like the option of A-1 sauce.  Really good burger...but just isn't worth over 3 dollars for one patty.  The fries were cut into a good size.  I can't stand in-n-out style fries where you can't taste the potato.  The fries here I could actually taste potato...you know...the stuff fries are made from.  Unfortunately; these fries were still quite a bit too crispy for my tastes.  Additionally; they put WAY too much salt on them.  I assume they would be better if I ordered them without salt.  They have one of those fancy coke machines which is nice.  Unfortunately when I visited more than half the selections were unavailable.  This place isn't bad; but just isn't worth the $9 I spent on a small hamburger; small fries; and a small soda.,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,All I had here were the fries to feed my 2 yr old twin boys. I ended up feeding my whole family of five with the large order. So five stars for fresh fries and overflowing bag...,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Five guys gives a good burger! I think their meat is of good quality and their toppings are on par as well. The fries are also very good. I like them Cajun style. Plus; they give free peanuts - who doesn't like the free nuts that Five Guys offer?   This particular location was good. The staff was nice and the food was good. The service was quick. The only down sides to this location is that; one; it is at Scottsdale mall (seriously - the clientele at the mall  seem to find it impossible to see past their own selfish aurora.) and two; the soda machine. They have one of the new; supposedly high-technology dispensers. Really; people can't seem to understand it and it takes 3 times as long waiting in line to get a drink as it would normally.  Otherwise; great place!,1
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Fenomenal fresh fries; fine burgers and sandwiches; friendly good service.  If you're going to go crazy and break all those resolutions about not eating....this is a pretty good place to break that resolution with fries and a sandwich.,1
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"Do Not Go To the Fashion Square Mall 5 Guys. At 4:30 pm (not the lunch rush) last Saturday the guy taking our order could have cared less that we were standing there.  It was our first time at 5 guys and we were perusing the menu and asking him for help.  You would have thought a robot was talking to you.  After we got our greasy bag of fries and beverages we had to search high and low for a clean table to sit at.  Not only were the tops of the tables filthy but there was food and garbage underneath them.  After eating greasy fries we looked at the two garbage receptacles and they were overflowing. Absolutely overflowing.  I went back to the counter and told the robot that the place was filthy and we couldn't get our garbage in the cans.  He says \Thanks.  Have a Nice Day\""  What a joke this place is.  Won't go to any Five Guys again ever.""",0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Oh m!y these are the greatest burgers I've had in a long time.  My grandkids love to munch on the peanuts while waiting for our meal. The service is fast (a fast food resturant) with a nice family friendly atmoshpher. The burger with the works is so messy and so good.,1
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"This is good stuff! I ordered a burger with almost everything; and I don't mean their definition of \everything\""; I mean almost every single topping  except mayonaise and BBQ sauce.   The burger was absolutely delicious; but I'm probably biased because I'm a toppings whore when it comes to burgers. You might argue that I eat burgers simply to eat the toppings. So this place was clearly geared for me with their policy of not charging for as many toppings as you want. We also ordered some fries. We tried both the cajun; and the non cajun versions; and I wasn't really excited about the cajun version.  The regular fries were cooked well; and delicious though.   The star of the show is probably their crazy drink machine. Maybe my yocal roots are showing through here; but I've never seen this before! They have a soda machine with about 20 choices for soda (coke; sprite; energy drinks; etc); EACH with up to 5 or 6 flavoring choices (strawberry; berry; etc).   Next time I'm in Scottsdale; I'll certainly be going back :D""",0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"It's true that Five Guys serves up a good burger and their fries have a nice flavor; but for me; it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the average fast food burger chains out there. Being in the mall and coined as a \fast food\"" spot; I have been disappointed with their service twice now. The first time; we waited over 20 minutes for our burgers and fries; but I thought it might just be a fluke. Sadly though; last night the same thing happened again. I was surprised that the wait was was so long for such simple food and also since this is a fast food place. The staff was also very rude when we asked about our food after waiting so long. The wait resulted in us being late for the movie. I won't be eager to visit 5 Guys again; unless I have a lot of time. Then again; if I have a lot of time; I won't choose a \""fast food\"" spot and instead go to a sit down restaurant. I hope they fix their service and turnaround time.""",0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,I like 5 guys.  The burgers are always fresh and made to order. I also love the assortment if free Topping from mushrooms to mayo to grilled onions.   My biggest issue is the lack of shame when it comes to grease. They toss everything; dripping into the bag. A box or better wrapping would help.   Also; I'm not a huge fan of the fries. I know people write novellas to their glory but it escapes me. I don't know if its the peanut oil or the pepper but I just don't like it.,0
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,I LOVE 5 GUYS so much that I decided this was where I was going for lunch in the Scottsdale Fashion Square. The order was quick; the cashier was friendly and seemed to really like her job. She was amazing. Also; the order was done pretty quickly despite a long line of people of waiting for their food.  But here is why they get 1 star: The greasy-faced young teenager at the end of the line decided that when he called my number; he was going to wait only 2 seconds before putting my burger in its bag back in a place away from the other food. I tried getting his attention 3 or 4 times after I approached the counter; which is farther than 2 seconds away no matter where you sit (go there and you'll see). I didn't know his name since he was facing away from me. He was getting the fries out of the fryer so I understood he didn't want to overcook and waste them; so I wasted a few more seconds before saying excuse me louder when he was not busy.  He continue to call out other numbers and ignored that at this point I was leaning on the counter with impatience. I asked if I could get my burger and he turned around and put more fries into the deep frier. Only about 5 minutes later; after being obviously upset; did another employee who was a dirty blonde male notice after coming out from the back and grabbed my bag from where the other employee put it on top of the fries heating lamp.  As I snatched it and stated I was waiting a while and tried getting the other guy's attention; he seemed confused. As I walked away he said to have a great day; and if there were not children in the space I would have flipped them off. To be honest; though; he actually made me feel taken care of in comparison to the other employee who was blatantly ignoring me.  One star for the amazing cashier and the kindness of the other gentleman; of course the food was on point but I waited entirely too long for it; and despite the fact that it was on top of the heating lamp for the fries; half the burger was cold. I'll go to other 5 Guys locations in the future.,1
jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,A short review:  Want to know what their burgers taste like?  Go to Jack in the Box; and order an Ultimate Cheeseburger.  That's what it tastes like.  The fries are similar to those at Teddy's Bigger Burger.    Disappointing.  In n Out is most certainly better.,0

jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Been to other Five Guys and loved it...but this was an epic fail.  Should have known when the guy in the grey t-shirt kept questioning the guy in the red t-shirt about when he was going to drop the fries.  Can anyone say raw potatoes here?  Worst fries I have ever had.  And it was obvious by looking at them that they were not done...SO SAD!  Burger and dog were OK but ruined by my disappointment...and not great service to boot.  Will not be back.,0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,EXCELLENT !!   This was my first visit to a Firehouse Subs and I doubt I will ever go to a Subway again.  This is actually REAL meat and REAL cheese with GREAT customer service.  Dylan realized quickly; and confirmed by asking; that it was my first visit and took extra time to explain the sandwiches; the menu; and the condiments.    I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich and will be back for sure!  Friendly employees all the way around !!,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,"Thank god for somewhere being open till a decent hour (10pm) on a Saturday night in the far east valley.  This strange sub shop in the Dana Park area was better than I hoped.  I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak (which they call a \steak & cheese\"") not expecting a whole lot but still having visions of the amazing cheese steak sliders from District.  The whole process took a bit longer than I expected since there were 5 guys behind the counter and we were the only ones there but it was still quicker than any Mr Goodcents I've ever been to.  The sandwich was a lot smaller than I expected.  The bread is similar in girth to a hotdog bun only longer.  They crammed a decent amount of meat and cheese in there to make a pretty good value.  I would have been happy if it had come toasted or baked but instead they gave it to me steamed.  Why anyone would want their bread steamed is beyond me.  It makes it soggy and spongy.  Really; it ruined what would have been a great sandwich.  If you are feeling adventurous; or you like steamed bread; then go check this place out.  Otherwise; maybe just ask them to microwave it.""",0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I love the firehouse theme; and like how the restaurant pays tribute to firefighters. The food was just okay to me though. It tasted just a tad bit better than Subway; and it was more expensive than $5 footlongs - so I'd doubt I'll return to Firehouse Subs.  I ordered The Engineer sandwich - packed with turkey; lettuce; tomatoes; onions; and mushrooms. There wasn't many mushrooms in my sandwich :( I really do like the original hot sauce. Definitely add that to any sandwich you try there. Maybe if I had kids I would bring them to this place; the kids meal comes with a complimentary firefighter hat.,0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Sorry to write a downer..  I ordered the Club sandwich fully involved (without the spicy mustard and onions); it was warm and drippy.. Warm is good; taste is good.. all good so far.. but the Drips from mayo :(; ugh i dont want wet spots on my slacks from lunch.    I also felt queasy afterwards; couldnt get the sub i had off my mind..   Ive had Firehouse sub in Florida years ago; it was fine. Maybe it's this location?  BTW i ordered online and i arrived a minute early from the expected time and my sub was ready; that was cool.    Subway seemed to be better?  maybe next time ill try a different sub and ask them to lay off on the mayo to prevent drips..i'll also ask around for favorite subs from firehouse.. maybe the club wasnt their specialty..   I felt like i was in a little firehouse with a lot of patrons.. :),0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,After spending Halloween handing out candy with my parents in the East Valley we were super hungry on our way home; about 9:45.  I always get nervous going into places like this right before closing time because I used to work at Paradise Bakery; and I know what a pain it is to clean up after just one stupid sandwich.  These guys definitely didn't show any displeasure.  We were warmly greeted with nary an evil eye in sight.    The decor is super themed but cute.  I like the cheese thank you very much.  The employees are even in a sort of fire fighter uniform.  Their menu is diverse enough to make most people happy.  I was really hungry so I ordered the Firehouse Hero; a trio of roast beef; turkey; and honey ham.  The meats and cheese are steamed before hand to seal in extra juice and just make it really good.  Nice touch.  The bread was exactly the way I like it; sort of soft; sort of crusty.  The meats all tasted really great and were actually distinguishable from one another; unlike other certain sub shops.  The honey ham was my favorite; it was really sweet and really good.  I wouldn't mind if they brought one of these Downtown.  Good sandwiches for a good price.,0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Great place for a sub.  I think it is one of the best sub shop franchises going these days.  the mesa location had great customer service.   good sub shop.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Firehouse Subs is a great sandwich place.  The food is great and the employees are always very friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is nice and they also have one of those cool soda machines.  I work in the same plaza and my company has ordered a sandwich tray from them for lunch many times.  It's always ready on time and reasonably priced.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I love Firehouse subs; food is awesome and they always remember my name which is awesome customer service.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I judge my lunch and dinner places to a different set of criteria.  For lunch it's about convenience; cost; and taste.  A distant fourth criterion might be the relative nutritional value of the meal.  Firehouse; wins on the first three and is worthy of inclusion into the lunch time rotation.  The sandwiches are hearty; heavy; and tasty.  Denser and more robust flavors then you'd get at the chain sub spots.  I doubt that this place will win any accolades from the American Heart Association but I also doubt that 85% percent of its patrons even consider calorie counts when they order one of these sandwiches.    A great sub.  Just make sure you eat fruits; vegetables; and other healthy options when you're not here.,0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Came here with a co-worker. Got a dr pepper from their really awesome modern soda machine. My co worker got a meatball sandwich. He said he was the best meat ball sandwhich he ever have. Which is saying a lot because his from ny; I believe they ate a lot of sandwiches haha... The service was fast. The place was really clean. Tried a bite of the meatball sandwhich; I hate meatball sandwhiches; to my amusement I really enjoyed this one.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I've been here twice and I just don't think it's any good. For the money there are much better sandwich shops. The customer service was fine; the store was clean and nicely decorated but the food was just average to a little below average.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,"The Steak &Cheese were first rate; lots of meat & cheese; good bread (ordered 2 large). The Smokehouse Cheedar was good but very heavy on BBQ sauce; so if you don't want a sandwich overwhelmed by  & dripping of BBQ Sauce I recommend you tell them to limit it or eliminate it. The sandwich was full of meat and otherwise excellent. The Oatmeal Raisin cookie is entirely too sweet for my taste....too much brown sugar in that recipe.   I returned the next day. I tried the large Pastrami Sub; it was loaded with meat & cheese; but was also topped with a healthy helping of lettuce and tomatoes.   Unfortunately; while the sandwich was very tasty (and filling!) I became ill a couple of hours latter and spent too much time in the restroom for the balance of the day. Since this was my only food for the day; the lettuce and tomatoes become suspect (since they were the only change to the sandwich I'd had the day before which was meat and cheese only).  The two other sandwichs were a repeat of the Steak & Cheese with onions and those guests; loved them and had no illness problems (neither sandwich comes with lettuce or tomatoes).   It's been good enough for me to return; but it'll be \meat & cheese only\"" from now on for me.  These subs are about $7.50 - $8.00 for a 12 inch. You really can't compare them to a Subway Footlong; since the Footlong is often $5 and the $2.50 - $3.00 additional cost at Firehouse should be expected to buy a better more meat/cheese filled sub (which it does).  BTW; on my second visit; the very pretty cashier repeated my order back to me three times...incorrectly; I really expected something would be wrong when I received my food;  but in the end; she got it right :-).""",1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,The best samich I've ever had. I'm hooked on the turkey bacon ranch sub. I love going here; they are friendly and never get my order wrong. I definetely couldn't work here; I'd be fat as I don't know what.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Good variety of subs/ ingredients. Good location. I loved the little area towards the front w/ the pub tables. They have one of those crazy; newfangled Coke machines w/ 100+ flavor options too.  My Italian sub was good. Basic; but good. Service was quick; staff was nice.  We'll likely be back if were in the area again.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I've been literally ordered by many people to try this place for lunch; so I finally did. Short and sweet; I've made up a new word to describe Firehouse Subs; phenomenaltastic. Best sub I've had in.. well; ever.,0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Maybe I'm just caught up in the moment; but on my neverending quest to find the best sub; I think I finally found it.  I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out; but I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the hot pastrami combo.  At first I thought it was a little pricey ($8.00) but that was before I took my first bite.  It only took one bite and I knew I was onto something special.  It all starts with the bread.  It was fresh; warm and very tasty.  The melted cheese; sauce; lettuce; onion and pastrami were incredible when all rolled into one bite.  Not much else to say except try it for yourself.,0
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,This place is pretty good and the atmosphere is fun.  Although I'm generally not a fan of subs; the sandwiches here were good.  For those who like a lot of meat; the subs here are stacked thick and the servings are big.  I though the meat-to-veggies ratio was off; but I guess that's because I like a lot of veggies.  There was also slightly too much sauce; causing the sandwich to get a bit soggy. Overall; I like this place; and the restaurant itself is nice; clean; with friendly service.,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Always a good choice and love the friendly environment they bring to the table. Prefer the meatball sub but everything looks great and yummy! Gotta love the personal service they also have,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,We tried Firehouse a few weeks ago and are telling all our friends and family to check them out! The subs are SO good and the variety on their menu is much more extensive than most places. The staff is friendly and I love the atmosphere.  Another huge plus is that they are one of the few restaurants I have been to that has the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine which is AMAZING!!  The only reason I couldn't give them 5 stars is because the service is a bit slow and they have forgotten things both times we have been there for the kids meals (the fire hat and Oreo cookie). Not a huge a deal; of course :)  We will be returning very soon!,1
n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,This was my first time eating here and my last! I am not a subway fan so I figured I would give this place a shot as it is near my house. Never have I had so big an issue with ordering a sandwich. When I walked in I took some time to look around the store and the menu to see what they had to offer. Big mistake! The lady at the counter gave me this look like I had spit on the floor or something. After about 5 mins of looking at the menu I decided to order the firehouse hero sandwich. Their prices are way more than I expected but figured if the sandwich was any good then it would be worth it.  As I paid for my sandwich and went to sit down I heard the counter lady say something like this guy needs to be going to Jenny Craig not here! I could not believe she would sit there and talk about a customer like that. Her personal feelings aside (btw aren't sandwiches supposed to be a healthy food option?) She should have kept it to herself. Or at least said it once I left. I am a big person but that has nothing to do with how I should be treated. As for the food I have to say I was not impressed. The Virginia honey ham was way to sweet for me. It had this weird almost maple syrup flavor that overpowered the rest of the sandwich. After 2 bites I was done. Bad service; high prices; and even worst food earn this place a nice spot on my never again list.,0

n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,"Firehouse is a solid sub shop and really isn't much more expensive than Subway.  They don't have a five dollar foot long; just better subs and a really cool soda machine.  The hot specialty subs are my favorite.  If I had to pick my favorite I would say its the \Engineer\"" but every sub I have ever ordered; at any location; has been good.  They are consistent; friendly and the subs are huge.  Get your sub \""fully involved\"" and there's no way you're leaving this establishment hungry.  If I want a sub sandwich and there is a Subway and Firehouse sitting across the road from each other; I'm going to Firehouse because the food is better and lets face it; firefighters are a lot cooler than Jared.""",1
WAqACt7FfSFcJs-gqysIlQ,Today was the first time I ate In-N-Out here in Arizona and I'm proud to say that it was delicious. I've never been a fan of burgers; but In-N-Out was always the exception when I lived in California. It's something about the buns that make it so yummy. Anyways; I ordered a #2: a cheeseburger; fries; and a medium drink. Of course I animal styled them fries. Mm! So mouth watering. Their pink lemonade is really great too. If you're ever here; definitely give it a try.  The prices are so affordable. I never really checked out the prices when I used to live in California because I was never the one to buy the food so I never noticed how cheap everything is. I mean; it's seriously affordable. The meal is about $5.30 (+ tax) which is a normal meal price I guess; but the quality of the food is just perfect that you truly get your money's worth.  Another thing I love about this place is the staff. They are so sweet and outgoing. They're awesome! Anyone who is reading this must stop by at this In-N-Out and enjoy a delightful meal with friends or family.,1
WAqACt7FfSFcJs-gqysIlQ,"Burger heaven!  OK Yelp team... you might as well toss this review in the \not recommended\"" pile; as this is going to be as biased as it gets.  I used to frequent In-N-Out for 5 years in SoCal... it has been over 5 years since my move to back to the east coast.  Currently; on business travel in Phoenix and first chance I get I hire a CAB to come here... Desperate?  Dedicated?  you decide.. either way.. In-N-Out does not disappoint.  I order my usual off menu order of Neopolitan shake; animal style cheese burger and regular cheese burger with onion.  Oh not to forget the animal style fries...  My dear cabbie waited outside as I feasted...  All he could say was that \""he understood\""..  Just like old times; the delicious flavors meld together in what has got to be one of the finest cheese burger experiences ever.""",0
WAqACt7FfSFcJs-gqysIlQ,Best Hamburgers on the west coast.  Usually a long line; but its well worth the wait.  This family owed restaurant is opening new locations throughout the southwest.  From Baldwin Park CA; they are now in Nevada; Arizona; and Texas.  If you live west of the Mississippi they might be opening or opened one in your neck of the woods. Hamburgers are made with the freshest ingredients and are made to order.  Beware of the hidden menu it becomes addicting.  I like the fries extra crispy.  The Milk shakes bring a happy ending to a wonderful meal.  If you are heading through the drive thru and they have a double order lane; pay extra attention who is ahead of you.  Usually the business guy is ordering for more than one.  The same with the pick up truck guy; he might be getting the entire work crew an order.  This is not the lane you want to pick.  Instead opt for the guy in the sedan all bye himself usually single or with a friend type cars are the best option because they know what they want and will get through a lot quicker.  Good luck and the best part is you can write a review while you wait for your meal like I am right now! Cheers!,0
WAqACt7FfSFcJs-gqysIlQ,In-N-Out Burger is a fun place to grab a bite to eat. The menu is fun with simple options that pack a good portion of flavor for a lunch or snack. Service is a tad slow considering they have hamburgers and hot dogs but the staf behind the counter were professional and nice.,0
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,This is one of my favorite chain fast food places.  Everything seems pretty fresh and can be a bit more healthy than your typical fast food fare.  This location is just like all the rest.  It is clean; the staff is friendly; and the prices all seem to be reasonable (though I think a bit higher than they should be for what you get).  The line can get pretty long during peak times; but it seems to move pretty fast.  I always get the same thing:  a bowl or salad with chicken although I don't know how a bowl and a salad are different.  Anyway; I get lettuce; chicken; corn salsa stuff; hot salsa and shredded cheese.  LOVE it!  Light on the carbs but probably high in calories...oh well...I try.  Pro Tip:  If you want cheese; sour cream and/or guacamole; order it on the side.  Even if you say you want a little bit; they will put heaps on your bowl/salad.,1
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,Stopped by for lunch with some colleagues and ordered my normal Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans; Sour Cream; Guacamole; Rice; Hot Salsa.  Since the weather was awesome; we sat outside and enjoyed the day.  The Burrito was actually kind of small for Chipotle....I guess they were stingy that day.  The only downside to sitting outside is all of the birds that bother you and fly overhead....you have to be careful.  Next time; I'll probably sit inside.  Return Factor - 60%,0
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,The food is good. The customer service is horrible. I asked 2 of the workers questions and they both ignored me.,0
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,Great food. Almost all gluten free. Wonderful service; above and beyond.,1
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,The service is always fast and friendly. Large dining are both inside and out. The food is always fresh and tasty and plenty of it. I've never had a bad experience.,1
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,I come to this Chipotle often; and it usually doesn't disappoint. Today; however; they were completely off. When I walked in; there were about 3 or 4 people in line in front of me; but only one guy on the line making their burritos/bowls/tacos etc.; and the cashier walked away to wipe down tables. It wasn't until about 5 minutes later that another guy walked out and put on gloves to assist him.  Then; when I got up to the counter; I ordered a steak bowl with guacamole to go. The portions this guy gave me were so small and when I mentioned possibly adding more rice; beans; meat; etc.; he gave me a surprised look and scooped an extra edge of a spoonful into my bowl. I usually wouldn't mind getting a smaller portion; but for $9.15? Then when I got home; the steak was chewy and I ended up spitting out more than I consumed. Not too thrilled; I don't know what was up with them today.,0
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,Chipotle is an interesting animal. They have many unique qualities and their service is always streamlined.  This review is for this and all locations I have been to prior. Chipotle......GO!  ~Fud/Drink~ The food is tasty...enough said. Delving deeper; you can see a bevvy of food options you can sink your teeth into. The meats are delicious to say the least. My personal fav; the barbacoa; really ties the burrito together (Big Lebowski reference). The other meats taste great; but barbacoa is seasoned perfectly. As for the ingredients; everything always tastes fresh; from the salsas to the beans and rice.... everything. You can stack as much of an ingredient into your burrito as you see fit; and I take advantage of this by piling on the the grilled peppers and onions. Is it the finest Mexican cuisine? No... But for someone looking to dine out and not eat a ton of calories like myself; Chipotle does it right. They provide you a menu off to the side that shows all the calories in each ingredient; and its easy to keep the calories off by following what you are putting in. I usually keep out the tortilla; which saves a lot of grief and calories; and still allows me to fill up on fresh Mexi-food. This is completely different to most Mexican restaurants. Nothing is deep fried; but rather fresh and filling. As for a bar or drink; there is nothing beyond a couple generic Mexican beers or a soda fountain.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ I never have much liked the overall restaurant concept; which oozes eat quick and leave. There are no TV's for you to lounge around and watch; music is not piped through the system; and the  chairs are wooden and not overall comfortable. Really; it makes sense; many people do not eat in; they get the burrito to go. It still might help to add a little more atmosphere to the overall experience; if you ask me. The service is always lightning quick. Despite long lines; they still get you in and out quick; and are quick to add the ingredients. Overall; they also are quite kind and talkative; I have never had rude service from service crews. Its a nice way to get Mexican; just no real atmosphere to experience the food in.  ~Extras/Rating~ Not much else to note; besides the various options you can get when choosing how to dine. There are so many combos you can go with; its fun to change up your burrito experience by coming here. As for the rating; they lose a full star for having no atmosphere whatsoever. I know its their concept; but still; not even a TV? It would be something if they put out some new options; like board games or other items to entice customers to stay more...Open up more bar options; then revenue increases.....gah; who am I to complain about business models? 4 Stars for outstanding food and great quick service!,1
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,The food is good but the portion they give you is terrible. I counted 10 steaks in my entire burrito; I got more rice than anything and very little cheese. I can't even taste the cheese. The chips are stale and very salty! The salsa is pretty good. The service was okay... Seems like they all were trying to talk and it was confusing me. If their portion size was better I'd be more satisfied.,0
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,This chipotle is a staple of Tempe Marketplace fast food eats. You can never go wrong eating here - fast service prepared by friendly faces. What's not to love?,1
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,I think I'm seriously missing something here. Am I the only person in the world that thinks Chipotle sucks? There isn't one thing on the menu that I enjoy. Not even the chips and salsa. How can you mess up chips and salsa??  EVERYONE I know loves this place. I feel like I'm an alien. Maybe they put something in their food that not only makes you bleed when you go the bathroom; but also hypnotizes you to think they have the best food when really its the worst.  My two most recent experiences are as follows:  A friend of mine insisted we go before a movie. I asked him if he really wanted to eat that garbage and then sit for two hours but he said yes. I watched him eat a burrito while I ate stale chips and the cashier made fun of me (YES HE MADE FUN OF ME! WHO DOES THIS?) for not ordering something. He actually asked me if I was watching my figure. I'm a skinny girl so it was really insulting to the bigger girls behind me in line. I could tell they were visibly offended.  Another time my boyfriend got a coupon for a free burrito for selling his books back to the school. I guess they figure that if you're stupid enough to sell your books back to the school instead of online then you're stupid enough to eat Chipotle. I went with him even if I didn't want anything. I just wanted to spend time with him. Well apparently everyone and their mother wanted Chipotle that day because the line was so long it went outside. The door was open so it was hot. Imagine every possible thing that could go wrong in a line happening at once. That's what it was. Sweaty people all over; screaming kids; crying babies; loud cell phone talkers; cutters.... Ugh. When we finally reached the front of the human labyrinth they almost didn't take his coupon even though it was completely valid.     In the end. Not a fan of the food; the experience; the staff; the building. No. Please someone tell me what I'm missing here!!,0
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,Every time I come here I receive excellent customer service and the manager Dusty is very personable and frequently greets guest by name as does JJ. They are both very professional and courteous. Great team leaders which reflects from the service given from this Chipotle's team members.,1
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,After walking around shopping;  what is a better way to sit down; relax and enjoy a fresh veggie bowl.. yummmm. The mild and hot sauce is super delicious!!! Yummm. Brown rice; bell peppers and onions; black beans; sour cream; corn; all three sauce; a little bit of their guacamole; cheese and lettuce.  Two squeezed lemons and Booooom. Delishhhhh Im so needy; I need hot sauce inside my bowl anddddd extra hot sauce on the side as well. :))  Great and friendly customer service!!!!  Ohhh how I loveeeee chipotleeeee.,1
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,My husband ordered take out for us last week. I ordered the chicken burrito bowl; the chicken was very hard and chewy; the guacomole had some brown spots. It tasted disgusting; I had a few bites and threw it away. Then got very sick with food poisoning symptoms for the next  3 days. In all fairness my husband ordered a steak burrito and liked it. I normally go to the chipolte @ baseline and stapley in Gilbert; there food everytime is AMAZING AND FRESH!,0
Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,This Chipotle is located in the Tempe Marketplace and for those of you who have ventured here well you know it can be a beast to get to it. The food and service is typical of any other chipotle but the parking and the crowds make this location a real challenge. So if you just have to have chipotle this one is as good as any other...but again be warned this one may not be worth your time due to all the parking and crowd issues. Eat; Drink; and be Merry my Friends!!!!,0
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Fast & friendly service and fast food as good as you can come by. I wouldn't expect anything less of Chick-Fil-A!!,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,I love chick-fil-a!!! Im a huge fan!  I usually get a number one (original chicken sandwich combo) with a sweet tea. If Im in the mood to be somewhat healthy I get the grilled chicken sandwich. Their honey mustard is really good too...my favorite kind from any fast food.  I just ate at this particular one today and had excellent service. The  lady that was helping me was really sweet. She just seemed happy to be there and in a good mood unlike other places. She even gave me a free breakfast sample (a sausage biscuit) since it was right after breakfast hours. I have never got this from any place before. It was a nice gesture. I didnt try it though; I just saved it for my boyfriend...he said it was really good though (and it was reheated),1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,I am not a huge fan of their food but their service is spectacular. All the employees I've encountered are incredibly friendly. I usually don't order food; I just pick up a lemonade. I LOVE that lemonade! But if you are ordering food; the chicken sandwich is doable.,1

5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,My family loves Chick-fil-a; and this is probably the location closest to me; but after at least 10 visits over the past couple of years; find their service to be friendly yet slow and inefficient.  I recommend taking the 202 two more exits to Power Rd; and visiting that location.  They have consistently great service; speed; and food quality.  I've been their more times than I'd like to admit; and never had a bad experience. In short; this is good; but great is just down the road.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,This review can go for pretty much any Chick-Fila-A because all that I've visited are awesome; but this one I frequent the most. Customer service is the best; they set the example on how it should be done. Don't let a line at lunch or dinner time detour you; they usually get through the line fast and the food comes out super fast  after you order. They bring the food to the table which I love. Great food; i always get a chicken sandwich. Very clean and well maintained. Friendly staff. My favorite for sure in this industry!,1

5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,My wife and I ate at this Chick-Fil-A this weekend and I liked it. She eats there all the time and has been trying to get me to go and I wasn't disappointed. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and some chicken tenders. Lemonade was awesome. More importantly the service was great. Everyone seemed to have such a great attitude which I appreciated. The person at the registrar was Camry and she was very helpful. We told her we were going to the movies and she told us where the theater was and how to get there quicker. I appreciated that she took the time to tells. My wife was impressed with how kid/baby friendly this place is. From diapers in the bathrooms to Cheerios in small cups for hungry kids; this place rocks!,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Folks; this is not your typical fast food place.  The employees are glad to be working here and it shows in the way they interact with the customers.  I go here and to the one on Stapely Dr. and both places the employees can sometimes be heard chatting and laughing happily while they work.  It's true... I kid you not.  The morale is A1 and that makes it a pleasant place to eat.  If there is a problem with your order; they are happy to fix it.  The food is served very fast; it's very good; and the place is always very clean.  There is a gluten free menu online and they can actually print out the nutritional values from the cash register.  My favorite item is the Charbroiled & Fruit salad.  The cross cut fries are not smothered in salty seasoning with MSG (Except for the kind of dressing I get has it.. not sure about all of the flavors though).    Oh; and one more thing... you won't find any *pink slime* here.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Best fast food place I've eaten.  Perfect if you have children.  Nice play area.  Food good and timely; service excellent.  Would eat here again.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,"We don't have fast food very often; but usually when we do we like to go to Chick Fil A.  Generally speaking; Chick Fil As are clean with polite; friendly employees and consistently good food.   This location is the exception to that rule.   The restaurant is constantly filthy in one way or another. It is still possibly a step up from some other fast food restaurants; but in the context of Chick Fil As standards; this one is completely sub par.  On one visit; I was standing in front of the counter while waiting for part of my order; and I noticed that my shoes were sticking to the floor. Initially I dismissed it and moved over; but found that I was STILL sticking to the floor. I looked down and found that there was a thick layer of sticky soda (movie theater floors x 1 million) that was now caked onto my shoes and causing me to stick to the floor even after I'd moved away from it. When I was finally able to catch an employee's attention to let them know; I was told \oh; there's a leak; we know about it\"" with no further action (no one came to clean it up; at least temporarily; during our entire visit to the restaurant)   On another occasion; I went to get a child's booster seat and when I looked over the few seats available; found that each and every one of them was disgustingly caked with various food splattered all over them. I selected one that had the food mostly relegated to the edges and sides of the seat; and proceeded to grab several Purell packets to wipe it down myself. Several employees glanced at me during the process but weren't too terribly concerned apparently.   On a regular basis; there are consistently a variety of smaller but still obnoxious ongoing issues; such as overfull trash cans and gross bathrooms. Additionally; a tiny thing that I've noticed (and appreciated) at other Chick Fil As is that when you get a highchair; they always always have a sticky placemat laid over the back of the highchair - this is so nice; because when your hands are full of a baby; your food; etc; it is great that they are anticipating your needs by having this readily available; and having it on the highchair means it is one less thing you have to grab. However; at this Chick Fil A; it is extremely rare for the placemat to be on the highchairs; you pretty much always have to stop and pick it up separately. Again; it is small; but it does make a difference and just shows that they don't care quite as much about their customers as all of the other locations.  The staff at this location is nice enough in the scheme of fast food places; but again; does not really live up to the standards that I've come to expect from Chick Fil A as a brand. They are your typical teenaged fast food employees; where I usually find that Chick Fil A employees are respectful; polite; conscientious; and engaging; these employees tend to be a bit more removed; more interested in joking around with other employees; and while they go through the motions of decent service; they're missing that little extra that makes such a huge difference at other locations. Additionally; I usually see quite a bit of management presence on the floor at other locations; but it seems much rarer here. I've also observed managers being pretty rude to employees once or twice - most recently a manager belligerently ordering someone in the kitchen to get \""some soup that is actually hot\"" in a very sarcastic tone with very angry body language.  The food is generally pretty much the same as other Chick Fil As; but our order does seem to be messed up more often here than at other locations. We usually order our sandwiches without pickles; and this only actually gets done about 50% of the time. It isn't a huge deal; but does completely change the flavor of the sandwich to a more pickly flavor; which no one in our family cares for.  If we had a location even only slightly further away; we would definitely make the trek; but as we are quite far from the next closest restaurant; we end up here anytime we need something quick; and each time we regret spending our money with this particular restaurant since it is so disappointing.""",1

5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,The service today really was disappointing and slow.  They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties.  It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order.  Funny thing I was the only person in line.  Normally; we never have any issues with this location.,0

5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Always a very friendly staff.  When one of my visits took a little longer than anticipated the comped my bill.  Excellent experience and customer service.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Chick FilA is one of the best fast food restaurants out there. They have really worked on the friendly-ness factor. BUT...This particular location has the most languid bunch of workers I've ever seen. I saw four people walk out because the 7 people working behind the counter didn't step up to wait on the customers -- they were too BUSY doing other stuff like paperwork; and stacking cups.   When it was my turn; I waited at the counter for 5 to 7 minutes in awe of the complete lack of service. Only one cash register was open while four more customers behind me waited to get somebody - anybody's attention. Plenty of employees were there all milling about and chatting amongst themselves. Hello???  Is there anything more important than the customers? Here's a case where they have gone out of their way to provide decent fast food; a clean environment; small extras like diapers in the bathrooms; fresh flowers; and great attitude by the employees; but then FORGOT to take their orders. I won't go back to this one.,0

5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,The food is great; but DON'T rush from the drive through without checking your bag for all of your ordered items.  And also check your receipt for that matter.  I ordered one meal; one sandwich; and one small fries.  Did not get our fries and the receipt says we were charged extra for the drink that came with the meal (that was given to us WITHOUT a straw).  So frustrating!!!!,0
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,"Bad food - bad service. The chicken salad sandwich made the roof of my mouth hurt because the bread was so hard and dry.  I had to repeat myself numerous times before they got my order \right@; then it still came out wrong.""",0

5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,This is the best location ever. Best customer service and always amazing food! Go here every day!,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Love the playground for kids at this one.  For that reason alone - 5 stars.  I mean its a chick-fil-a and you know what kind of food they have; so nothing amazing; but always good service and good food.  The staff is always friendly and asking how they can help.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Our favorite fast food place. They have the best service and good fast food.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,We went on a Tuesday for lunch; And sorry we did... We placed out order and found a table. 10..15...20....25 Minutes go by and no food. The Bus boy / Food runner stops by and ask what the name on our order was. He then comes back and offers us Shakes for our wait. (which we gladly accepted) 10 Min later her brings us our food with a 1/2 Dozen cookies... ( A FOOD RUNNER... WHILE ALL 3 MANAGERS are standing at the counter) Not once did one stop by; ask or give an apology...   So I thank the food runner for stepping up and taking care of us. But what a poor showing of Management....,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Ok Im going against the grain here. I really don't understand what the big deal is about Chick-Fil-A. Everybody raves about it. I've gone several times and I really dont think the chicken is that great. Yes they give you lots of choices in dipping sauce but if the chicken is so great do you need dipping sauce? The only reason why I'm a return customer is my 3 year old loves the play ground. Yes I do agree their staff is always very friendly. But the chicken never hits the mark for me Ive tried several items on the menu. Yesterday I had the spicey chicken wrap. Uh wheres the spice? Not spicey what so ever. It was loaded with lettuce and dry; I could tell it was not made fresh. My son ordered the chicken nuggets I tried one of his it was ok; didnt blow me out of the water. My son could care less what they were serving he just wanted to play. The place was busy and my food still arrived quickly. Im sure I will return if my son bags again as we drive by,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Consistent top notch service. In the three years I have worked near here; I have not had bad service even one single time. This is a great place to eat; and a breath of fresh air when compared to the service at most fast food joints.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Great service; the food is good; and I like what they stand for.  The Play yard is a little small; but my kids still love it there.,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,I go to this restaurant at least two to three times a week service is good as any exceptional. And you can't beat family night or a play place in a restaurant if you have small kids,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Genuinely friendly employees. Fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. What I really like; though; is that the kids meals come with books!  And they even have board books for kiddos under 3! If you have a smaller appetite; you could order the kid's meal for yourself and then give the book to your kid.  Win-win!,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,I love Chick Fil A; I always have. This location is pretty dangerous for me as it is right by where I work. As I've stated in previous reviews; I'm crazy picky when it comes to what I like to eat. This location is *outstanding* because they always get my order right. My food is always nice and hot and the chicken is never dry.  The employees are always super polite and professional; the restaurant is always clean; and the food is always deeeelicious. I love this place. *yum*,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,This chick fil a used to be the best; we went every week for family night on Tuesdays. Apparently it's taken over by new ownership in the last month and its just awful. The food is still decent but customer service and cleanliness is definitely lacking. The high chairs are horrifying now; which is one reason we used to like to go there; it was super clean and I didn't worry about bringing in a thousand things to sanitize my child's eating area. I'm not sure who the new owner is but he better step his game up; family get used to be super busy but it's dwindling down a lot now.,0
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Great environment and top quality customer service. I stopped in for a quick lunch with my son.  The place was packed full of people; but a manager was out of the floor refilling drinks and smiling! Great experience and great people!,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Excellent food; excellent service. I eat here frequently as I work within walking distance; and have never had it any different. Great place for a quick lunch or a family outing. My son loves the playground here too!,1
5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,"As fast food chicken goes; this is probably the best.   I have tried a lot items on their menu; my favorite is the chicken nuggets.  These nuggets are not just chicken  \parts\"".  These nuggets are real chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces;  with 8 or more sauces to choose from.  I like the honey mustard and buffalo sauce.  But the best nonfood item is the service.   I usually go early in the day and I find the staff to be extremely friendly and they will go out of their way to make sure your order is correct and served in a timely manner.""",1

jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,It's hard to go wrong with chipotle. The food always tastes great. Don't let them skimp you. Everything except meat and guac you can ask for more and there's no extra charge; so there's that tip. Anyway; the lines are always long but you usually get through it fairly quickly so I don't mind. Chipotle is always busy no matter the location. The service is kind of inconsistent. Sometimes; I'll deal with fantastic employees and other times not so good at all. Don't order online; because 2/3 times that I have they hadn't even started making it yet when I went at the pick up time and there were no apologies of the sort given. Also; sometimes the rice is severely undercooked and crunchy. Three stars for flavor; but that's pretty much it.,0

jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,We get the fastest; most friendly service here! We have frequented this chain in 4 other states and this is the best by far! The food is always fresh and I love that they use locally grown ingredients.,1
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,Been here twice in the pat few weeks an I must say that I enjoyed it quite a lot.   Very consistent in flavor and service.  Better than almost every chipotle I have been to in the past few years.,1
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,"This review is solely on the service at this location.  I tried the app for ordering from my phone. While I was placing the order; I received a phone call which switched some of my order choices; the main thing being the pickup time from 5:30 to 4:45.  After the order was placed (paid with credit card); I tried to call the location to have this corrected but nobody answered the phone. I attempted to call 3-4 times but to no avail.  When I arrived at 5:30 to pickup my food; I asked what their phone number was; someone pipes up \it's on the card\"" so I compared number and indeed I had dialed the correct number.   Side note; I began to explain the checkout girl that the order was probably sitting for 45 minutes excuse of the incorrect time; she said \""we made it no more than 15 minutes ago\"" does this mean I would have had to wait if I indeed ordered for the correct time?  Either way; I definitely had to re-heat my food web I came home...  Back to the phone number fiasco; I proceeded to dial the number in front of them but heard no ringing and nobody picked up. I tried again 5 minutes later and lo and behold they answered after 1 ring....  Also note; when it's a busy time of day; every 15 orders the entire line gets held up so they can refill the selections. They work really slow and don't know how to get the line moving.  P.s. Lately their chicken has been sub-par; lot's off fatty pieces that are inedible..""",0

jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,Stopped in for a quick bite today to recharge.  Got a basic beef and cheese burrito with salsa and sour creme along with some black beans.  I probably would pass on the black beans next time; but they were good; just not the right taste for my burrito.    Given all the variety of how to make the burrito; really the end product is up to you!    I would not be so crazy as to call this healthy food; but it sure beats a greasy burger.  (What doesn't?)  Anyways; worth a repeat.  The service was quick and alert.  The staff there was nice; and not zombified.  Well worth the visit!  Enjoy!,1
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,I am addicted to Chipotle.  There I said it.  I previously reviewed Chipotle prior to truly understanding just how darn good this food is.  Five stars; I scream it from the top of the mountain!  Folks that work here are always helpful and laid back friendly.  But very very efficient; professional and awesome!    ALSO; Check out the iPhone app they have now so you can pre-order EXACTLY what you want!  AWESOME.   ENJOY!,1

jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,I am very disappointed to be writing this review. I love Chipotle!  However; this one in Surprise Arizona; is the worst one that I have been to; and I have been to a lot! I have been to this one at least 8 times to give them a fair shake.  There has not been one good experience from this Chipotle. May it be from me ordering a Chicken bowl online; then to get home and there is no Chicken. Or I order a Chicken bowl and the Chicken is burnt to a crisp; not just seared or chard but burnt.   Then there was the time that rice was still kinda wet; so it was more of a burrito soup bowl.  Or when the bowl makers glare at you when you ask for fajita veggies. That was a good one!   The worst part is; when I go to this Chipotle; my bowl is always only about half full when they are done building it. I eat it all in one meal; and am still hungry.   When I order a bowl at Chipotle in Peoria; Prescott; Salem Or; Covallis Or... etc... It is always; and I stress always two meals.   This Chipotle is so bad; I will drive to Peoria all the way down Bell Rd to get Chipotle vs. Going to the one in Surprise; the customer service is always rude; rushing; don't smile; and don't conduct business how they should.,0

I usually get workers that work well. However; today I ordered gauc and chips; barbacoa bowl; and a carnitas quesadilla... and the only items I received were the quac with NO chips and a barbacoa bowl. I think the workers were either new; untrained; or deaf. And the line also literally didn't move for about 10 minutes... two girls were working at the time.. I don't know there names; but they don't do there jobs well and need to find another one.,0

jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,The food here is always very fresh and consistent. The employees are very nice and put together the food orders very quickly which is nice when you are in a hurry. I've never had a bad experience here; I would recommend this location.,1
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,"I actually love Chipotle; especially when they're \attempting\"" to phase out gmos. BUT this location needs to have more workers on the Fridays and Saturdays when it's late. It gets busy and feels like I'm iniatially being pushed by the workers to order fast; but then made to wait at the 'second' station; while they help the next people.  I mean geesh; at least get a decent number of staff. The place is certainly getting enough extra money out of us. The one by my work is a lot more generous. The manager of this place can also be rude. I once went in unsure of what to order and decided I did not want anything as my boyfriend stood in line to get his own. The manager went from extremely helpful to suddenly offended and too important to notice us once I decided not to order. How childish. I used to go there all the time; he could have  remained courteous to regulars. But his flip flopping attitude isn't the whole problem. What I loathe is this location and a few others are price gouging for guacamole. I ALWAYS get the veggie bowl with guac at no charge. But this place is suddenly charging (while the one by my work isn't); so I definitely feel gipped. Especially; when I have no interest in their new Sofritas -which are meh. I feel like the new tofu option is just a way to justify the extra charge for veggie bowls and frankly; it's not adequate. I tried it and I go without it. To make this particular Chipotle seem even more stingy; they now claim they are \""not supposed to\""  give out a side of cilantro. Really! I just gave you the extra $1.59 and now the cilantro is suddenly valuable too!? Puh-leeze. But I'm sure they will charging for herbs soon. I will not go to this location anymore; I could ignore the manager but not the attempt to nickel and dime us for every bit of food-even freaking seasoning.""",0
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,Busy Busy Busy!  Seems like everytime I go there is a line out the door.  Our entrees were good as usual; and I don't mind the wait.  If  you don't like to wait in line to order your food; you might want to consider calling ahead to order and pick up your food.  The location is usually very clean; loud either from the music or people talking; but there's also an outdoor area you can eat at.  They have very good guacamole for a fast food place; and the tortilla chips have a lime-salt flavor that accompanies the guacamole really well.,0
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,"Having three orders and wanting to bring my food home; I decided to use the option of placing an order online. Upon completion; my order was said to be placed and ready for pickup at 6:00. When I got here at 6:00; I skipped the long; long; long line and headed up to the front cash register (this feels inherently wrong; but the site encourages you that this is the way pickup is done; and the line is to be skipped; why else wait throughout the ordering process?). The cashier notified me that she did not have any orders placed for pickup. In other words; despite receiving confirmation online; my order was not ready or even sent to the location. I had to recall my order from memory while the cashier jotted it down on a piece of paper and sent it to the front of the line to be made. I waited a total of 30 minutes for my order to be made. Yes; I was offered a drink and extra chips; and they discounted my price by maybe 30%; but I was definitely not expecting to wait 30 minutes for the long line to dissolve before they began making my order. Had I known; I would have just stood in line or left altogether (although; I was really craving Chipotle..).  Bottom line is; do not rely on \pick up\"". Bring a confirmation with you; at least. Or you may just opt to stand in line. Would most likely be the quickest option.  The cashier who helped me was very cosiderate - it was out of her control and you could tell she felt bad. Wish I would have gotten her name for reference. When she was trying to help me out; the manager seemed uninterested and offered a quick \""yeah; sure\"" when she pressed him about discounting. I know this place gets busy; and I was by no means demanding a discount; just a bad situation altogether.""",1
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,"I watched a great documentary about Chipotle on Netflix recently. I never have this place a second look until then. I'm not a \burrito\"" fanatic; but after watching the documentary I was impressed by the quality and quantity of their ingredients. So I gave them a try.   Saturday night; around 830pm. My GF and I rolled in and we were certainly not the only customers. It seemed that this was a go-to place got a lot of people at that time of night. I ordered a chicken burrito; dark rice; cheese; salsa; sour cream; and lettuce. The employees were not skimpy with the ingredients... that warm burrito was packed to capacity!   Overall delicious! Very nice employees sealed the deal. I'll be back to try the steak next time.""",1
jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,Robert and Curtis; your location has a lot of opportunity today. Very poorly ran front line today.  Need to come up with a better plan when you have large pickup orders also. Folks in line should not be subjected to a longer wait for them.,0
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,I go to Chick-Fil-A once every 1-2 months. I typically order the chicken sandwich; but for this visit I decided to get nuggets. My 8 piece actually had 9; which was a nice bonus. They were warm; but not fresh out of the fryer as they usually are. The waffle fries were fresh and tasty. Good unsweetened iced tea. I'd give it 3.5 stars (rounds to 4).,0
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,Friendly but not the same since Josh left. I see many new people working here and they don't seem to offer the friendly service as before.,1
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,I think I have been to two C-F-A's in my life; one in Chino Hills; CA and this one.  Even though I gave it 2 stars; I really want to say this: the staff were friendly and accommodating. The manager and employees were smiling and you felt a genuine desire to serve folks. Bathrooms were clean; tables; too.  So why the 2 stars? Well; ordered the soup and salad combo...sorry I don't know the name...but the portions were nice. However; when I opened the salad container; I found two pieced of cardboard. At first I thought it was tortilla chips. Then I looked very closely to confirm that it was cardboard. I took it to the counter; showing the manager. She too was shocked and very kindly asked if I wanted a refund or and exchange. I'm not mean person nor anal retentive. She was kind and genuine and gave me excellent customer service; so I just asked for an exchange. Happily she did so and I returned to my seat to finish it and my soup.  After I was about half way through with my soup; unfortunately; I began to feel kinda sick to my stomach; felt a little queazy and a bit dizzy. And then it passed...I chalked it up to perhaps there being a bit too much salt in the soup.   But like I said; it passed and I finished both. My friend also finished her meal and we were both fine.  I might give them another try...not sure though.  And one last point: It took me about 10 minutes to find them in Yelp because they are listed under 'Chicken wings' and I don't think they sell one wing dish....very frustrating...,1

aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,Chick-Fil-A does a few things right.  They serve your food promptly out of a very clean restaurant with a very courteous staff!  They have a large play area for the tiniest customers and even have wipes to clean off their little hands before eating their little meals.    As a person who follows a Gluten-Free diet you ask what the heck are you doing here; let me share my secret.  They will make any of their salads with non breaded chicken.  Upon request they will also make naked chicken strips that are quite tasty.  My daughter loves the sweet tea where I like mine unsweetened.  They have waffle cut fries as one of the sides.    You are able to order off the lunch menu during breakfast if you don't find anything to your liking.  Their super friendly staff is the main reason I keep returning not to mention my teenage daughter is a fan and can't tell her no!,1
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,I come to this Chik-fil-A a lot and rarely have an issue; and today was the first day that I thought an employee was being snarky. The girl in the box and the girl in the window were nice but Will;  the guy bagging up the food; made a comment to the person in the back about how I ordered part of my food and rolled his eyes when I was asking about how many extra pickles were on my sandwich and how that wasn't enough.  Not sure how he is an employee at Chik-fil-A.,0
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,Good service.  They could work on keeping the tables a little more clean but better than most fast food places.  The playground is for 3 and under I think and it is pretty small but keeps my 2 year old entertained.  Definitely a nice place to stop by for breakfast.  I always think their chicken is on the salty side but every once in a while I like it.,1
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,I love Chick-fil-A!!! Always great service and great food. Strawberry milkshake and one of the NEW Grilled Chicken Club Sandwiches is the perfect meal.,1
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,Chick-fil-a is one of the few fast food chains I will eat. Especially now that they have made some changes to their ingredients and removed some of the chemicals from their food. So when I'm on the road I always seek them out. Anyways; this is a very clean location with good customer service. I usually get a kid's meal with side salad but this time I tried their new Market Salad....hands down best fast food salad I've ever had! Actually one of my new salad favorites outside of one I've made in my own kitchen. Well played Chick-fil-a; well played.,0
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,I'd never been to a Chick-Fil-A before; but I expected it to be like any other fast food place. Boy; was I in for a surprise! We were greeted coming in the door and the people that helped us were quick and very nice. They even brought our food out to us. My son had a blast playing in their little toddler area; too. With service and an atmosphere like that (not to mention the food was really good); how could you not go back?,1
aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,About 12 years ago; I was working with a business consultant from Atlanta.  She told me that Chick Fila was a potential client.  I said.... What is his name?  And; what business is he in?  I had no idea that Chick-Fil-A was a restaurant serving chicken.  I thought it was a persons name.  So far; I have been to Chick Fil-A twice.  Once at a grand opening in St. George; and once now here in AZ.  I give it a solid 3.5; so it rounds up to a 4 star.  The good -  Well; chicken; chicken salads; chicken wraps and chicken type burgers.  Plenty of sauce.  Like the calories listed on the menu; great pricing. Decent tasting product.  Great staff; management and customer service.  The bad - Nothing really bad; But; they have all the unhealthy choices here like milk shakes; soft ice creams; tons of sauces and the like. I always find it funny to see someone ordering a complete meal; a shake and washing it down with a diet coke.... Otherwise; choices are all your's.  The end result - Overall; the place is pretty good; I am NOT a fan of fast foods in general and Chick-Fil-A is no exception.  However; besides; Raising Cane; I find that the stuff here is pretty decent!   GK says; check it out.,1

aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,Tad bit disappointed this morning with the breakfast. Chicken; egg & cheese bagels were bland and seemed to have shrunken in size. Both were ordered regular but one came without the cheese. To our luck as the Mrs. Didn't actually want cheese. The restaurant must not have been wiped down the night before as it was plain to see that the booth walls and backs of chairs were covered in greasy fingers and hand marks. However the highlight was that service was adequate and associates were polite as always.,1

dWVc-Pes8olLaUIM1NC14w,location is not too bad. in my experience Cane's has always had spectacular customer service. and the food seems to always be made in a timely manner. furthermore the Cane's sauce is to die for. The only critique may be is that I expected the dining room to be a bit bigger considering its in a very high volume populated area. other that this by far one of the best chains out there.,1
dWVc-Pes8olLaUIM1NC14w,Can never go wrong with Cane's. Great location fast services and I'm glad there's finale one in the arrowhead area,1
dWVc-Pes8olLaUIM1NC14w,The food was amazing! The service was great. The food came quickly and was piping hot. We Will  definitely be going back.,1
dWVc-Pes8olLaUIM1NC14w,Slow service; management doesn't even know there own promotions (ASU Game Ticket) which is on the counter by the register; if it wasn't for the good food I wouldn't bother but I'm not going to drive to Avondale for chicken fingers,0
dWVc-Pes8olLaUIM1NC14w,Solid chicken strips; but not much else. Unlike many; I'm actually not a huge fan of their toast or their fries - they always seem to get soggy by the time I get them home. But that's ok - because their chicken strips; along with their delicious special sauce; is reason enough to stop in. The strips have just the right amount of breading; are fried to hot perfection; and are consistently tender and juicy. They have a number of meal deals; but we usually opt for a tailgater pack - 25 strips with sauce; no fries; no bread. Always a hit for snacking during football games or for parties.  The Peoria location is easy to get to across from Arrowhead Mall on Bell Road; and is a lot closer for us than the other location by Metro Center.  It may not be the super fast; but it is worth the wait and the service is always friendly!,0
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,"I do like Chick-Fil-A but noticed some quality differences with this location from the other locations I have visited. The drive thru line at lunch is ridiculous (prepare to wait at least 15 minutes) but decided to wait anyways just for pure convenience and part laziness. Service was pleasant as always; I do like when they address you as \Sir\"" or \""Ma'm\"" and say \""My Pleasure\"". Staff is very accommodating and helpful. However; when I got back to eat my lunch; I noticed the chicken sandwich I ordered was very overcooked and the lettuce was soggy and almost brown in color. The usual large piece of tomato was just two measly tomato slices plopped down. Honestly; I did eat it but was very surprised at what the quality was here...I've never had this issue before. I hope management reads this and can improve their product.""",1

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Well Hello There;  I must do a review here at Chick-fil-A on 16th Street and Camelback. This place is so clean; professional; and calm. I love the décor it is so cute and cozy and it promotes a longer stay and with that comes more money. But it is worth every dollars; dollar; pennies; penny; cents; and cent (Hahahaha) if you get my drift. They can have it! (Hahahaha)   The service I received was stellar by a man at the register named Vandell. He is customer service with a smile and with a friendly and professional demeanor. Boy; that man is awesome. I have never seen anything like it in fast food. I hope he is getting paid what he is worth. Or that would be a total shame on Chick-fil-A!   NOW THE FOOD: The regular chicken sandwich $3.19 minus the pickles was ohhhhhh sooooooo AMAZING! I have dismissed this restaurant brand for many reasons over the years to only discover: I WAS AN IDIOT! (Hahahaha) And I must be honest I was being cheap because a chicken sandwich just doesn't appeal to me or my wallet. But boy was I wrong; wrong; wrong; and I have missed out all these years. The sandwich was so juicy with every bite that I had to look at it and really look at it with every bite and to ask myself: IS THIS QUALITY REALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?  Man; YES IT WAS! I pulled out a waffle fry and with no salt to ensure its freshness and (I don't eat salt when cooking anyway) so the fries must be salt free. These fries were piping hot and perfectly crisp. The large fry was the perfect size for the meal. I didn't feel cheated in portion in any way. The fries were so hot; fresh; and crisp that I just couldn't resist another large fry. And for $1.95 for a large one; why should I not get another. GREEDY I know but OHHHHH well; they were just that magnificent. And McDonalds will not see me on fry excursions anymore! Waffle fries come to mamma! I will be glad to give you my $1.95 anytime! (Hahahaha)   The drink was so perfect in carbonation that I really enjoyed the ice cold Coke. Now should I have to say anything else? Oh yeah and by the way; I saw a salad at the table across from me and it was the prettiest green salad I have seen in a long time. I just cannot leave that out of this review.   I will be having many salad rendezvous' because the one I saw was so pretty and green. Trust me go try it and eat it! I did not go at a rush hour so if that may make a difference go when it's not busy. Enjoy and think of me sitting in a booth somewhere with no salt on my fries and my juicy grin; from my juicy sandwich. And these sandwiches have a super soft bun that does not over power the quality of the meat. Well enjoy and now I must go make up for my Chick-fil-A ignorance over all these years. (Hahahaha)   C-Ya with a new piece of chicken already in my hand! (Hahahaha),0
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Service is above and beyond;  chicken is great...  The prices are insanely high. Still don't understand why it's so busy.  I have a business meeting nearby every week and come here when I am early;  out of the 40 times I have been here I have only eaten here 3 times.. What,1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,they forgot my clucking sauce!! How am I supposed to eat my chicken without my clucking sauce?! My order was chicken nugs whit some sauce. And not to mention home girl look like she hates her job; don't take that out on me Chick fil A!,0
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,I had never really been to Chick-Fil-A before and I admire their Christian stance. I don't have a car so the other restaurants were kinda too far for me to get to. I was thrilled when I learned one was opening up on Camelback and 16th street. I went to the opening day and had the charboiled chicken sandwich; waffle fries and a drink. Food was great. I was simply amazed at the service provided. It does not have the fast food feel to it. Numerous employees stopped by to see if I needed a refill on my drink or if I needed anything else. They brought my food to me. All employees were courteous. Right before i left; I decided I needed a milkshake. So I ordered a cookies and cream and it was amazing.   Thankful I have a restaurant to go to that stands up for what's right and is pro traditional marriage. :),1

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,I absolutely love and support chick fil a and was please to hear they would open one by me. But since they have opened I have had nothing but problems; atleast on their drive thru. The first time I let it go. The second time I called to let them know; then the second time I was put on hold while an employee talked with another employee on how there was a complaining costumer in the line. At that point I was livid. Hung up and wrote a complaint on their website. Finally of weeks of not going there I finally decided to try it again and once again I was disappointed. The food is great it just seems like their costumer service sucks. There is no difference now from that place and mcdonalds next door,0
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,"Somewhere between Costco and Starbucks I got hungry; and I didn't want samples.

First of Parking sucks here; especially with a full sized truck but I ended up across in front of Verizon since I'm still able to walk.

I wasn't more than 5 feet inside the store and I was greeted by a young man manning the registers; \""not bad\"" I told my self.

I ordered was given a cone and started to find a seat; must've wandering around for about 30 seconds before I chose a seat but by that time my meal was ready.   The chicken \""patty\"" was an entire chicken breast!!!! Nuff said. From a guys prospective; its a done deal; leave me alone; I'm eating; who cares about the decor....I'm eating.

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,When I saw the sign that a Chick-Fil-A was opening in the Biltmore area I was jumping up and down for joy.  Chick-Fil-A is by far my favorite fast food restaurant.  The closest Chick-Fil-A was 20 miles from us house.  :(    I really like the new layout of the restaurant and it is pretty cool to be able to see the kitchen when you are eating your food.  Also I love how there is always someone at the door greeting you with a big smile on their face and that the line went really quick to order your food.     Last but not least; I order the spicy chicken sandwich with fries and a coke zero.  After all it is my favorite sandwich.  Thank you Chick-Fil-A for opening a store in the Biltmore area; if you have not been to Chick-Fil-A before then you should definitely go.  They are always really friendly; quick and hopefully.,1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,We love this place. As a mom with kids; I really appreciate the extra attention I receive at this Chick-fil-A location. Food is great with lots of healthy options; and they not only carry my tray to my table for me; they keep checking in to see if there is anything I need (like a refilled drink) so that I'm able to stay with the kids. I love getting to have a salad (try the Grilled Market salad--grilled chicken; bleu cheese; toasted pecans; strawberries--delish!!) while also getting my kids the chicken nuggets and fruit they love. The kids meal toys are also way better than others--usually a book or something else educational. And of course you can always trade the toy for an ice cream cone!  We enjoy the play place; too; and will be spending more time here now that they have delicious coffee for my morning cuppa!! Overall; great service; yummy food; a wholesome; pleasant environment--a good experience every time. (PS--to the other reviewers; if something isn't right with your order; let them know! I'm sure they will do their best to make it right!),1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,We love this place. As a mom with kids; I really appreciate the extra attention I receive at this Chick-fil-A location. Food is great with lots of healthy options; and they not only carry my tray to my table for me; they keep checking in to see if there is anything I need (like a refilled drink) so that I'm able to stay with the kids. I love getting to have a salad (try the Grilled Market salad--grilled chicken; bleu cheese; toasted pecans; strawberries--delish!!) while also getting my kids the chicken nuggets and fruit they love. The kids meal toys are also way better than others--usually a book or something else educational. And of course you can always trade the toy for an ice cream cone!

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,What a great experience!   Despite this being a fast food. I enjoyed it.   Customer service was great. Very friendly employees; great and clean atmosphere. I was impressed.   Food was good as well. I ordered a fruit salad instead of fries and it was actual fruit that tastes good. There were even blueberries in it.   I am not giving it a five stars just because it is still fast food chain.   Nice job chick- file :-),1

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,"Favorite fast food restaurant of all time.  The manners and customer service are impeccable; always a \pleasure\"".  Food is always amazing; and yes; it's more costly; but you get what you pay for!""",1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Food is what you would expect. However I did not expect to be waiting over 20 minutes in the drive through line just to get my food. And once I got home I realized that they messed up my order - I ordered a deluxe chicken sandwich with everything on it and the only thing that was on it was the chicken and cheese. Very disappointed in their lack of customer service and attention to detail.,0

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Chick-Fil-A always seems to have some of the best costumer service anywhere in town. I recently came in here with my pops for a quick bite to eat and we were greeted the moment we walked into the door. The cashier was super patient with us; being that we had no idea what to order. He was so nice to use the entire time we were there. I wish I would have gotten his name and given him a compliment to his manager.  Our food was served to us very shortly after placing our order; which was almost troubling since I did not think they had time to make it properly; but it was fantastic. I would love to go here more often.,1

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,"I don't eat at Chik Fil A because I support gay rights and I'm also bisexual. However; my dear brother sent me a number of gifts cards for xmuss; including Chik Fil A. He loves me. I still have his kids' Christmas presents in my closet; because I'm a despicable human being (just kidding; I'm broke and forgetful).  So I was making a run to Trader Joe's/Whole Foods and I remembered I had the card in my clutch; so I stopped by. First off; I had trouble finding the entrance. So I sort of walked all the way around; almost to the door; and directed my attention quizzically to an old man with white hair; drinking out  of a Chik Fil A cup; where the entrance was. He shrugged with a mild snarl and said he didn't know.  Okay; so my first impression of the patrons is that this guy's a d-bag. Ruh roh.  I made it to the line and nervously ordered a chicken nugget meal; feeling very out of place amidst a sea of white people with money while I was wearing my dyke shorts and a tank top. That's okay though; I'm all about diversity. The cashier gave me a cone for my order; in which there was a bit of confusion; but I made it to an empty booth and slid; relieved; into the faux leather. I also went to get some napkins; and I offered some to the man at the table next to me; because he didn't have any. He accepted. Alright; jerks: 1 nice people: 1.  The server was a charming older lady with pretty; curly red hair and huge; beaming smile. Good vibes. So I texted a few friends who had recommended this place that I was diving on in (har har; get it; get it).   Holy cow. No; really; holy cow. When Ashley told me there was crack in the chicken; I thought she was overreacting. And then the waffle fries? Is that ketamine I taste? But I was full halfway through the nuggets (I got the 8 piece); and I had refilled my Cherry Coke once. If I was going to break the diet; by God; I was going all the way.  So anyway; I'm nearing stuffed territory; and I paused to think; What Would My Mom Do?   Mom would say that there are starving children in Ethiopia; and I HAVE TO EAT THE REST.   On the last bite of chicken nugget; I suddenly remember that I don't eat fried food; because it makes me ill; and then my stomach churned. I made an inner sign of the cross and finished. Afterward; I stopped and people watched; eavesdropped for awhile. I tuned my ears for one intellectual conversation; or at least a three dollar word. Nope. It was all about kids and babies and church and guns; blah blah blah blah. By now; my stomach is rumbling like I've been impregnated with an alien baby; and naturally; I place my hand to my belly. I decide it's time to go.  I texted my brother that the food was good; and rode home. Then I threw open the front door and promptly threw up in the bathroom. You win this round; Chik Fil A. That lesbian kryptonite you put in the chicken did its job.  Will go back to use rest of gift card; plus probably only for a drink and fries.  As a side note; I will say that the staff is clearly trained in diplomacy. The cashier asked why I hadn't been in so long; and in my articulate tongue; I said; \the gay thing.\"" She replied in a robot voice and plastic smile that everyone was entitled to their own beliefs. Then she blinked and smiled some more.""",1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,I went to this chick fil A a couple weeks ago and it was breakfast time. But I asked if I could order lunch and they said yes. service was great as usual but when I got the sandwich and return to work the chicken on the sandwich was half the size of the normal chicken. I know this cuz I eat there multiple times a week.,1

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,I've been to numerous chic fil a restaurants across the phoenix metro and this one by far has the fastest service; friendliest staff; and freshest food. the lobby was being immaculately maintained by Drew; who was unrelenting in making sure my family's dinner was going well; stopping at nothing to clean around the table; and reload our sauces and drinks. we were very pleased with his and the rest of the staff's most excellent service. above and beyond your average chic fil a location!,1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,This is for all my fast food spicy chicken sandwich connoisseurs  When purchasing spicy chickens your committing to such a delicious food coma and salty bloated haze followed with a gross nap because you just endured a forgot to chew your food face stuffing. Opposite of anything cute or decent.  (Always order 2)  Wendy's was a strong contender until consistency of the sandwich leaned towards more bread than meat. Weak. Time to move on. Be smart.  A guilty pleasure of mine. Will be a tough habit to break... will i ever?... (to be continued)...,0
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Oh no; Chick-Fil-A did not put a new location within a decent driving distance of home. Oh no... Before; the closest Chick-Fil-A was in PV!   If I have to have fast food; Chick-Fil-A is my favorite. This location's people are as nice as they are at any other location. The menu; however; is missing the cheesecake (boooo). Also; this location is always insanely busy. The planners didn't do a good job designing the traffic flow -- you can easily find yourself out in the lane to exit onto 16th Street; or even all the way back into the Sports Authority/Verizon parking lot. The cool thing is that they bring order takers out to the drive through line to take your order on an iPad; and you never have to bother with the speaker  So bottom line; the food is still great; the service is still great; and I'll still come here. But the property planner needs to find another job.,0

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,They have screwed up several orders and one order was missing a sandwich...so instead of inviting me back in right away to get the sandwich; they sent me a coupon for a cheaper sandwich.  Not too happy.,0
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,First time at Chick Fil A was delicious! We went through the drive thru and had wonderful service! They helped us find exactly what we wanted. We ordered every sauce and a bunch of food!   Their special sauce was amazing and I really liked the Polynesian sauce. I just wish they had one in Las Vegas! Hopefully I can go back someday!,1

XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant for weeks now. I was fortunate enough to dine in the restaurant this evening on its grand opening. A co-worker and I rushed to this Chick-Fil-A immediately after leaving work. The architecture is stunning throughout the interior as well as the exterior. We ordered the classic breaded chicken sandwich and each one was consistently delicious.  Aside from the delicious food and impressive building; I believe that it is the staff members that will bring success to this restaurant. I have never been to a fast-food restaurant where a staff member touches each table to ensure a premium dining experience. As we sat enjoying our dinner; a staff member by the name of Kevin stopped by our table to inquire how our food was tasting and if we needed anything. Kevin then arranged a tour of the kitchen for my friend and I. We were guided by an eager Chick-Fil-A employee named Ryan. He brought us on a trip through out Chick-Fil-A's interesting history and then elaborately explained the operation of Chick-Fil-A's kitchen. Kevin and Ryan made our visit memorable and I foresee weekly visits to this restaurant. Congratulations Chick-Fil-A on selecting such a hospitable group of employees.,1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Most amazing chicken you can get anywhere I've grown up loving Chickfila chicken and now that there's one close by where I live I live it even more! The Summer Strawberry Salad is amazing as well it has chicken with strawberries and blueberries; cheese and granola! So yummy for my tummy! The only thing is they are a very religious franchise and they close on Sundays to honor their values ...which sadly is usually the day I most desire to eat there. Bummer but its all good. If its your FIRST TIME just order an original #1 chicken sandwhich make sure you have the special HONEY BBQ SAUCE and you will be dreaming all day wondering what you've been eatting all ur life! Next stop in I will be ordering a platter of chicken bits!! Oh yeah:)  SassiMissCassi,0
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Great addition to the Camelback strange. Great customer service. Always a smile. And the food. Lovett Lovett Lovett. Would highly recommend this to any connoisseur of chicken.,1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,The tastiest fast food chicken around. That being said; it's still fast food. I've visited this location about 15 times in the last few months. Here's what I gather:  - for being fast food; it's good. Above average and consistent.  - it's still fast food. Sweet; salty; and a little greasy at times. It's an indulgence.  - service is fantastic and no fast food joint compares.  - ambiance/design/feel is incredible. Again; unmatched in the fast food segment    The food deserves a 3.0 the service and ambiance deserves a 4.6 lets average that out to almost 4 stars.,1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,I stopped by this Chick Fil A because of a disastrous catering experience at a different location. Danielle helped me with a last minute strip and nugget tray that only took about 15 minutes to put together. The chicken was piping hot and smelled great. A huge hit at my event!  I felt the need to do a review because Danielle was so great. She offered many items (mints; hand wipes; serving utensils; extra napkins and dipping sauces; etc) without asking and even gave me an advertising stuffed cow in appreciation of my order. Would definitely go to this location again!,1
XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,A month old and still a huge line; staff still seems overwhelmed and inexperienced. My order is correct about 50% of the time. I will still go as it is the closest location to my home; but I prefer the Paradise Valley location; which is cleaner; has better staff; and I've never had a problem with my order being wrong; either. Drive thru logistics are mind boggling; but can't really be blamed on the franchise. Hopefully the experience will improve over time.,0
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,"I was raised in the south and have been eating Chick-Fil-A since before I could talk. My favorite fast food place without a doubt!!!!  Food quality is good; employees always seem to love their job and if you eat inside you get table side service! What's not to love?  I have never had anything that wasn't good a CFA and they have some of the best milkshakes EVER!!! I highly recommend their summer special Banana Pudding filled with little bites of Nilla Wafers!  Super friendly location that is kept clean and food is always fresh and the play area will keep my almost 2 year old and 8 1/2 year old content!!   For fast food; it is truly \As good as it gets!\"" for fast food. There you go Chick-Fil-A; you can have my 5 stars!""",1
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,"This weekend I went to one of my favorite fast food joints; Chick-fil-A. When I walked in; I was surprised; I was actually greeted to \Welcome to Chick-fil-A! How may I serve you?\"" Let's be honest; how many times does one actually get greeted at a fast food restaurant? Chick-fil-A is best known for their original sandwich; which is made up of a breaded chicken breast with pickles and a spray of butter on the buns. I; myself; love the Number Four Meal.  The Number Four Meal is also known as the Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe. The juicy chicken is a piece of boneless breast seasoned with a spicy blend of peppers. Included is a bun; topped off with Green Leaf lettuce and a slice of Pepper Jack cheese with pickles.  Also included in the meal are their scrumptious Waffle Potato fries with a hint of salt. Of course; you can't just eat your sandwich plain without having anything to dip it in. I personally love to have my spicy sandwich with Buffalo and Buttermilk Ranch sauce. Buffalo makes the sandwich spicier and Ranch just cools it off for the wimps in us. Normally people love their waffle fries with ketchup; but I love having my waffle fries with Chick-fil-A sauce. When dipping my waffle fries into Chick-fil-A sauce and putting it in my mouth; my taste buds just want to scream out loud and thank me for the delicious taste of my fries with Chick-fil-A sauce. Last but not least; you've got to have something to cool everything down. It could be either a soft drink or a milkshake.  Overall; my visit to Chick-fil-A was worth it. They have friendly customer service and most of all my meal was just enjoyable. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves great customer service and most importantly appetizing food.""",1
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,Great fast food!!! Yummy chicken!!!!  Always superb service! Great Breakfast too!!!!,1
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,I go here regularly.  The employees are always super friendly. Orders are always accurate.,1
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,Clean; family friendly; fast; superior service; and awesome food. Made a complaint one time to the manager about family night. The next time they did that activity during family night they had addressed my complaint! We are frequent customers for life!,1
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,This is without a doubt the best quick service restaurant I have ever seen (21 years in recruiting). Every employee is polite and helpful and demonstrates outstanding customer service. It is sparkling clean and very kid friendly. Each Tuesday is Family Night and there is a balloon artist and crafts for kids...and great healthy food,1
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,Everyone loves Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwiches (and they are pretty damn good) but the service here is friendly and the place is just damn spotless clean.  The men's can even has some kind of dried flower arrangement; is this a fast food joint or a sushi bar?  Don't rely on the stupid google map for directions; this place is actually south of 202 at E. Ray Road.  I never trust that idiotic GPS stuff anyway.,1
nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,I've been here many times and have yet to have a bad experience. Today; after I had ordered my meal; I proceeded to pay with a gift card I had. Upon swiping the card; the employee notified me that he was having trouble getting the card to work. No sweat. He offered to grab me my drink in the meantime as I wait for him to try and fix the card. A moment later another employee greeted me; and attempted to help see what was wrong with the card. After about 5 minutes the two employees figured the gift card may not have been activated at the store that it was bought at. Not the end of the world; I went to open my wallet and pay with cash; and the staff member told me the meal is free for today!   I was shocked! I've been to full sized; dine-in restaurants; and I've still never seen the staff deal with an issue (that wasn't even their fault) with such politeness; and professionalism. I wish I would of taken down both of their names to thank them in this review. But for any managers reading this; know that these are the type of employees that have a positive impact on your business.   The whole situation took about 5 minutes; both staff members involved were more than happy and understanding about the problem. And even when we came to the conclusion the card had not been activated properly at the walgreens I had bought it at; they still INSISTED the meal was free.   Very impressive; and I hope Chick-fil-a values it's employees. I'll gladly return again.,1
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,Unless it's a chain restaurant with crappy food to begin with; I generally start my base rating of chains with 3 stars and then add or subtract depending on various factors such as cleanliness; service; etc.  I like Chipotle because they focus on getting their meat from sources that place an emphasis on the welfare of the animals.  I feel that when the animals are treated humanely during their life (not stuffed in a tiny box all their lives and walking around in their own waste) it reflects upon the taste of the meat.  As a result; I'm a big fan of their carnitas.  I feel you can really taste the difference; and if it's a few dollars more for it; it's worth it to me.  When I went here they really loaded up my burrito so I got a lot for my money; and everyone was very friendly and provided great service.  Would go here again!,1
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,"The Chipotle Chicken Burrito: Impossible Behemoth; or Bonding Experience? When one examines a Chipotle chicken burrito; one thing is plainly obvious: it's GARGANTUAN. Simply  thinking about eating the thing is enough to make your head spin. However; thankfully; there is a solution to this massively meaty treat; bring a friend along and share a meal!     Chipotle is set up as sort of the \Mexican\"" Subway. Known for its savory burritos and salads; it is even more popular due to customer's ability to custom order their burrito. Don't like rice? Ditch it! Want extra salsa? You got it dude! (Thumbs up!) The possibilities are endless. You begin with rice; and then you have your choice of beans: baked; black; or refried. Next; they pile on the chicken with your choice of vegetables: peppers and onions; corn; lettuce; etc. And finally the sauces: salsas; sour cream; and guacamole. Make your combination and \""voila!\"" it is ready for you. All for about 6-8 dollars!     But no matter how few or many ingredients you choose; inevitably; by the time your done; your burrito will simply be to copious  to comprehend. That's when you're buddy can join you. Not only will you enjoy a hearty meal with a good friend; but you'll have some money in your pocket left over for chips and salsa too! The atmosphere in Chipotle is very friendly and welcoming; the perfect place to stop by for lunch or dinner to have great food and conversation with a good friend. The décor is delightful; the aromas are mouth-watering; and the cacophony of conversations around is somewhat reminiscent of a cafeteria. As you take in your surroundings you feel at ease and a sense of comfort there. As you and your comrade share this blimp of a burrito; you'll have great fun wondering how someone came up with this perfection of flavors and spices!""",0
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,I love Chipotle.  They offer huge burritos as well as you can skip the tortilla and get a bowl.  They also will make cheese crisps for children.  Prices are $5.50-$6.00.  You can have anything made into a salad for an additional $0.50.  They can get crowded on the weekends; but you can also fax or do your order online and just pick it up.  We love going to Chandler Mall and get the kids a meal inside and we get Chipotle for us.  Best bargain there!,0
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,I see a couple recent negative reviews and I'm surprised.  My family and I eat here quite a lot.  There is always a long but fast-moving line.  We worry about having an available table but there's always one available by the time our food is done.  The food is reliably good and our orders accurate.  The employees are always really friendly; yet fast - they work together like a well-oiled machine.  I have yet to have a bad experience.,1
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,OMG Burrito the size of my arm! This is a great location; and the staff is amazing.  Everyone is always so friendly and nice.  I love the cilantro lime rice Chipoltle offers; and when I want something filling but not *terribly* bad for me; this is a great option.  I usually get my order to go; and they are always super nice about adding extra layers of foil to keep my burrito at optimum munching temperature.   All I can really say is YAY BURRITOS!,1
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,Very quick service! The three workers greeted me right as I was walking in. Not something I am used too. The portions are smaller than at other chipotles; the rice and chicken in particular. Overall a good experience. I was in and out in no time.,1
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,The staff at this location are friendly and accommodating! They are very accurate with phone in orders and online orders and the line moves fast when its busy. Highly recommend.,1
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,Seriously they need to figure out how to follow instructions. Every time I order online; it is completely wrong.,0
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,I love this place!  And so does my family!  It's so cool that you can order your dinner on the Internet or on your iPhone; bypass the line and eat a great and healthy meal.  The kids love the build your own tacos.  The burritos are so huge; I usually get one to split with my wife.  So; I can feed the whole family of 6 for less than $25--which is a deal these days for this quality of food.  Again; if you haven't tried ordering online or on your phone--you've gotta try it!  Great food!  Great service!  A+,1

WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,This chipotles is very sloppy and has major issues with customer service. The short female manger is a bitch and doesn't have a clue on what customer service is.... I have never seen so much turn over in an establishment. Watch the grill guy when he make rice...... he puts his bare hands in it..... gross.,0
WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,I love chipotle and go at least once a week and usually more. I always get the exact same thing....bowl with brown rice; lettuce and steak or a three point meal they ALWAYS say; as this is a little cheaper than the regular bowl.  Today the girl at the register and I believe the manager were so rude. They told me all the other Chipotle's haven't been charging me enough and basically arguing with me in front of everyone.  I can't believe the service at this place; it was so bad. I will never go back to this Chipotle.,0
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,Staff was fantastic.  It was our first time in and they were incredibly friendly with a smart alec like attitude (in a funny way) and we loved it!  First timers get a free cookie!  The place was spotless... very very clean.  Loved that.  Now for the food... Hubby had a Hickory smoked turkey sandwich - cold sandwich... it was really good.  yummy chewy bread - very soft and fresh.  And mind you it was about 8pm at night.  I got a California Turkey Club - this is toasted...  I didnt know that when I ordered it but my bad for not paying attention to the menu board.  It was still very good but I liked the cold sandwich better... its all just a personal preference... hot or cold... they were both very tasty and all ingredients were fresh and delicious.  I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to eat here but it was a good sub.,1
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,I could eat subs for lunch every single day and never tire of subs.  Usually I go to subway because of location and price; but when I want a real treat I order Mr Goodcents.  I order the same thing every single time and consistently it is delicious.  The delivery driver is so professional and she is a sweetheart.  When I am feeling extra crazy I order chocolate chip giant cookie.  All very delicious!! Not the cheapest but definitely worth it!!,1
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,Mr. Goodcents is a great alternative to Subway.  They have more ingredient options and a few locations around the valley.    I ordered the Italian sub with Capicola; Pepperoni; and Salami.  They have Asiago bread so I got it on that.  The vegetables are very fresh and the sandwich was great.    For the $5 footlong lovers they have 8 subs on that menu and if you want a different one it's only .49 extra.  They also have many sub size even 8 inch so if 6 is too small but 12 is too large have an option.    If you've never been check it out you won't be disappointed.,0
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,"After some shopping at Norterra my husband was in the mood for a sub. He saw a sign for Jersey Mike's & headed over. When we got closer we saw the \coming soon\"" part. Haha; he was bummed. Then I used my handy Yelp app on my phone & found Mr. Goodcents; which is only a couple miles from our house. We got there a lil after 7 & there were a couple people ahead of us in line. I decided on the Nickle sub which had capicola ham; pepperoni & salami. I got the 8 inch on white & added  provolone cheese; lettuce; pickles & mustard. Hubby ordered the Penny sub which had turkey; ham & roast beef. He got the 12 inch on white & added swiss cheese; lettuce; onions; tomatoes; pepperoncinis & oil & vinegar. We both got combos with drinks; but I got a cookie & he got chips. Total for both meals was a lil over $15. The subs were very fresh & tasty; we'll definitely be back!""",0
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,We love us some Mr. Goodcents!  Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and welcoming.  I am obsessed with the razor-thin onions they put on the sandwiches. Everything is cut fresh and to order.  Unlike Subway; their bread tastes freshly baked and is very soft.  If we have a hankering for a sub; you better believe we'll be heading for this place!,1
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,What like about this place is the service.  Cold cut meats sliced as you order your sandwich and it goes right on your choice of bread.  The guy doing the slicing had an awesome customer service attitude; totally aggresive but also friendly.  The sandwiches were good.  If you need a quick bite for lunch I would say Mr. Goodcents is the way to go.  Don't expect anything too extravagant; its a sandwich....,1

ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,"I've been coming to Mr. Goodcents for a while and was interested in their \new\"" toasted selections.  I ordered their California Turkey club; they took my name and disappeared to the back only to come back out and continue helping customers.  I figured it may take a minute or 2 so I let the customers behind me move ahead with their non-toasted selections.  Quite a bit of time passed and what had to be 10-15 minutes later a lady emerges from the back with my sandwich.  I got a \""sorry for the wait\"" and took my sandwich to my table.  It was then I found out that the guacamole was left off; so all I had was a cheesy turkey sub.  I then had to go to 3 employees to get this guacamole; with another \""sorry\"" to go with it.    Needless to say by the time this saga came to an end; the rest of my group was done eating and got to spectate as I ate my sandwich; as well as eating additional time off our lunch hour.  Pretty disappointing; maybe all sub shops aren't equipped for the toasted game.....or maybe they could have better communicated the ordeal that was to come.""",0
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,Dear Subway; although we have had a delightful relationship over the years; I must confess that I have recently started frequenting another sub shop ... Goodcents. While I enjoy the aroma of fresh baked bread and a happy greeting when I enter your doors; Goodcents has been able to provide for me in ways that you have not. I must confess; it's true... portion size does matter. And while you can provide 6 inches or 12 inches of delectable options; Goodcents can provide me with 6 inches; 8 inches; 12 inches or even 16 inches of satisfying deliciousness. Also; Goodcents has bared its soul; thinly slicing its meats and cheeses right in front of me when I order. It's refreshing. I'll still visit you; Subway... afterall; Goodcents isn't everywhere. At least not yet. But I thought you should know that they have stolen my heart.,0
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,The grandkids wanted Mr. Goodcents for dinner. We've been to this location several times throughout the years especially since it is right up the street from us.   I have always been  very impressed with this place!!  If you've never been; when you order a sub they literally slice the meat in front you... to me is what a sub should taste like.   I have always had a great experience with both the food AND customer service ).I prefer this over Subway or Quizno's anyday!!! Very reasonable prices and great food.  If you get a chance; try this place.,0

ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,I love Goodcents way better than Subway.  Their bread; meats and cheeses are so fresh.  They slice the meat and cheese right there for you.  In addition t bread is heavenly...They are fast; courteous; and clean. I've never had a bad experience here.   Just an FYI I get the veggie sub on wheat. My wife like their tuna sub Goodcents is super clean and super efficient.  Easy parking lot to get in and out of as well  FOOD: Excellent sub sandwiches. They don't skimp on their toppings.  When I want a sub I choose this place over Subway. PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Fast; friendly service. Very personable; Sam kept our soda and iced tea filled to the brim. CONCULSION: There's really not much to say; I've never had a bad tasting sandwich from there and they have never messed up. Makes me wonder how I put up with subway all these years.  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!,1
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,Great place to go for a sub sandwich!  Meat & Cheese is sliced to order - no pre-packaged/pre-sliced crap!   Plenty of sandwich & topping choices!  Owner and all workers are always friendly & service is fast!  Penny Club; Italian; Buffalo Chix are some of my favorites - yet; all are good.  They also have a kids menu & pasta which my little one loves!  Stop in & enjoy!!,1

ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,Hands down the best customer service..!and even better subs the wheat bread is super good I've been coming here for many years..the subs are better than Subway or port-o- subs thats for sure..! Besides who wants to eat at a place named after a dirty subway or a stinky port-o-potty..? Not me,1
ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,This place has been here forever.  One of the best sub places in the area.  Friendly staff and great pricing.  They shave the meat and cheese right in front of you so you know it is fresh.   Today I visited Mr. Goodcents and I ordered the Penny Sub without ham.  The sandwich maker added a couple extra pieces of roast beef and turkey to compensate.  The bread was soft and the overall sandwich was great as it normally is.  We seemed to get into the place just in time because the place filled up right after we sat down (I guess word could have gotten out that I came in.)    This place is leaps and bounds ahead of Subway so do yourself a favor and pick this place when you have your next hankerin'  for a tasty sandwich.,1
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,I am a big fan of Chipotle... nothing new there. The only reason I ever hesitate to eat here (especially; this location) is because it is so damn busy... However; today; for the first time I used their fax order form- Totally awesome. I faxed it in; I called to confirm; I got there; the lady asked my name; handed me my bag; I paid and I left. I almost wanted to tease the suckers still in line.   This is officially now the ONLY way I will order Chipotle. Score one for me and my time!!!,1
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,This is one of my favorite Chipotles! They give you generous portions and don't skimp on the guac when you ask for it. I ordered veggie tacos from here and everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!,0
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,This chain seems to be consistantly good everywhere. Food is always good quality and service is always fast.   In this location the manager and staff seem exceptional. The manager works the line serving food and gets to know the clients. Great job.,1
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,I enjoy Chipotle and appreciate their consistent food. But fresh organic food does not mean low cal.  I normally get the barbacoa bowl; no rice; black beans; fresh salsa. But lately I have gotten the crispy tacos with lettuce on the bottom; steak; black beans; corn salsa and fresh salsa. I used to get a side of guacamole and chips but found out that that one bag of chips is like 1000 calories. Ouch. No more chips. I get the crunch from the taco shells. I like that we can order with the phone app and it is ready and waiting when we get there. Unfortunately those waiting in line do not like that we go right up to the front of the line to pick up the food.,0
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,The night before we were to leave on vacation; we decided not to cook dinner. So; we thought of Chipotle on Shea. I used the Chipotle app on my iPhone to order two burritos.   Drove over and picked up our dinner and headed home. When my wife cut into her burrito; it wasn't what she ordered. I wasn't going to drive 13 miles to have it changed. She couldn't eat the rice and sour cream. She scraped all of that stuff off.  I called Chipotle and talked to the manager he was gracious enough to make up for the mistake the next time I showed up. I just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.  I love their food and the only reason why I'm giving them two stars is because 'I've experienced better' from them.  The next time I go there; I'll watch them make my meals.Forget about ordering on the phone.,0
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,Amazing service; amazing food. What can I say?! Super yummy salad bowls... :) yay!! So glad they have vegetarian black beans!! As a vegetarian; being able to eat here is awesome and delicious!!! Not all Mexican places have 100% vegetarian beans. Often the beans have lard; so again; happy for chipotle!!!,1
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,this chipotle is SUPER TINY!! and so the line can be a bit crowded.  there's plenty of room on the patio; but that doesn't work out so well in the middle of summer when you might as well just go sit on the sun.  i was SHOCKED at how efficient and friendly they were here.   i mean; i've come to expect quick  friendly service at Chipotle; but everyone seemed to actually really ENJOY working there.  nice! and of course the food was  fresh and delicious!  this is a great location if you're going to take out; but if you want to eat on premises i recommend NOT going to eat lunch at noonish.  go early or late if possible.,0
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,Always fresh; delicious; and quick service. This is a staple for me.,1
QJ4iodv1xkUYBSZ9y1MWVg,My go to Chipotle in Scottsdale. I have been to pretty much every Chipotle in Scottsdale and non of them compare to this location. The food is always seasoned perfectly and the chicken is never burnt. Staff is always friendly and my internet orders are always waiting for me when I get there.,1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,The food is excellent ! Great price/quality; the food is always fresh!  The service is excellent !,1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,I must preface this with the fact that I eat at chipotle quite frequently. However; after today I don't think I will be eating there any time soon. I went on lunch break to get my husband and I a quick bite to eat.   I ordered a burrito with chicken for my husband and a burrito bowl with chicken for myself. It was the lunch rush hour and the chicken was empty; so I agreed to wait a few min for some more to come out. I patiently waited about 3-5 min and finally the chicken came out they finished our meals with the toppings and I was out the door. At home I opened my bowl and much to my DISMAY the chicken was RAW in the middle like not just kind of pink; TOTALLY PINK. I ran to my husband to have him check his burrito before eating and it was also RAW. I couldn't believe it so I called the branch immediately and asked to speak to a manager. The girl on the phone informed me that due to the rush hour I couldn't speak to one. I explained to her that my food had raw chicken in it and she offered for us to come back for a free replacement.   I quickly said absolutely NOT! I watched them throw the chicken from the grill onto a used cutting board with a used knife that cuts all the cooked chicken; they MUST know that if there was just ONE breast of raw chicken that was cut with those instruments; that means that the whole process and kitchen area has been contaminated.   In conclusion I will NOT be returning to that Chipotle.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,I'm taking a long break from this location. I've been here 3 times...the last 2 visits I've had issues. Once; I ordered 3 carnitas soft tacos; which came w/ moldy taco shells. My last visit I ordered a carnitas burrito. My first bite included a huge piece of plastic bag (like they cut open something into the tub and let the plastic fall in w/ it). I'll stick to my normal location for a bit.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,This is the last of my visits to this location.  3 strikes and you are out.  Especially when its 0-3.  Since Chipotles inception; I have always had good experiences at all the locations I go to.  The only complaint I ever had was that it may have been too busy; but thats a good thing.  This location across from Scottsdale Fashion Mall is (To me) a horrible example.  95% of this is attributed to the staff there.2 out of 3 times Ive been there; they didnt have any Chicken at lunch time.  I can see once; but twice?  And then I was told 20minutes before it would be ready.  They didnt see that they were getting low and have it started.  Each time Im dealing with the staff on the line; they are inattentive at best.  No beans; they start to put beans on.  Ask for Fajita; they pass it by so I ask again.  Light Hot sauce; nahhhhh how bout a huge spoonful.  Light SC; nope..you want a giant glob of it.  Today I saw 8 people working.  somehow 1 of those 8 was making orders alone. (this is at 115 pm).  Finally as hes making mine some backup arrives.  Well at least I thought so...and then he leaves to take out trash with my poor burrito sitting in front of the cheese; incomplete.  He said someone finish that.  after 2min someone finally got some gloves on to finish it up and they instantly rolled it without asking me if it was done.  It wasnt.  So they unrolled it; made a gdamn disaster of it to finish it.  Guess what; it fell into 3 pieces when I took it out of the foil because of the gallon of hot sauce on it; and the re-roll.  Oh; how delicious; the fajitas were black/burnt too.  yum.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,Chipotle is a sure thing; and this location is very good at getting a long line of people moved through the line quickly.  Not a ton of seating; but a lot of the customers are getting their orders to-go anyway.,1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,I love Chipotle but I'm giving them five stars not on their food but on their service! I went there a few days ago and the guy checking us out was so nice and helpful! He was very friendly and even though they were busy ( it was lunch time so everyone was there) i didn't feel like he was rushing me out the door just very friendly. :) I love seeing good service I think that is big thing a lot of businesses miss! so props to Chipotle ! :),1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,i love chipotle. i love that when i go here my most difficult question is chicken or barbacoa? always happy with my meal.   with that said...  talk about age discrimination. they just started doing a kids meal. it comes with a small taco or quesadilla (a few other things to choose from); two sides plus chips and a drink. for some crazy $3 amount. i am very jealous of all the young people now.   a lady in front of me tried to cheat this kid meal system and man did the people working there handle it poorly. they were clearly talking about her while she stood right there; awkwardly waiting and pretending like she didn't understand why she didn't get her sides and drink. um ya; because its a kids meal crazy lady; you're like 30; sorry you're short but you don't pass for an 11 year old.   but ok chipotle; people. get over it. give her what she thought she was getting and let her know they cant give her a kids meal next time but they will let it slide this time. they held up the entire line while we all got to experience this awkwardness. i was embarrassed for her. i was nervous waiting in line. all i could think was 'do they need to make this so uncomfortable?'   i say no more age discrimination; we should all be allowed to comfortably order the smaller portions. and lady in line before me- next time order by phone to go. that is the proper way to cheat the system.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,Is every Chipotle the same? Is every prom date the same? NO!  This location is fantastic. The staff is fast; the food is fresh; and the restaurant is kept clean.   I've never been disappointed.   I'm not going to get into the nuances of what makes for a great meal at Chipotle; because they are quite prominent around town. The menu is simple; and you can pretty much order whatever you want; as long as they have the ingredients.  My only piece of advice for you is; when you walk in; turn left to get in line. Don't be a jackass like me and turn right. You'll see what I mean when you get there...,1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,Outstanding service; food quality; portions & speed. The employees are excellent!,1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,Had an amateur roller today. The veggie burrito is made big and I messed up the rolling process by getting mas rice; light beans and the roller could not handle the switch. It was knife and fork city upon my return home. Guacamole is still great and really makes the burrito slightly above average. Chicken is poor quality and not white meat and beef looked bad this visit (once every 6 months). Did you know that this month is the chain's 20th birthday and the first one was in Denver; CO. Felt very safe as 8 cops were also eating dinner as I was getting to go order. Line moved fast; but if you want chicken; try cafe Rio; much better.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,Excellent Service; and even better food; i'm still amazed that they can fold these burritos; and for the money these are excellent.,1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,The food is delicious and a great price; however this review is in regards to how I witnessed employees treating what appeared to be a new trainee. I felt uncomfortable as a patron because a redheaded seasoned employee was barking orders at the new trainee and proceeded to make fun of her with the a tall; slender; brunette cashier. It is upsetting that such unprofessional treatment of employees is tolerated; maybe she is a new employee and a little slow and doesn't get it; but there is no excuse for humiliating her in such a way.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,"As with most chain restaurants; the main difference between different locations is the service. I love Chipotle; and it pains me to give them only 2 stars; but this location just isn't cutting it. I've been in for lunch quite a few times; and it's usually fine. My main complaint is with the phone; online; or fax orders.   The first time; I placed my order from my iPhone; and naively assumed all was well. I showed up to pick up my order; and the girl explained that their system was broken; and it didn't send my order. She said \this is all it printed\"" and held up a sheet of paper with my name and phone number on it. Okay; now I completely understand that my order was supposed to be on the piece of paper; but why didn't you just call? I would have been more than happy to repeat my order over the phone 45 minutes ago; so that it was ready when I got there; rather than standing here 5 minutes past my order time repeating it.  One time occurrence; I thought. So; round two. I placed my order online; waited 5 minutes; then called to ensure they received my order. They confirmed my order and the time; and assured me it would be ready. I arrive at my scheduled pick up time; say my name; and they go to check on my order. A moment later; they return; \""it will just be a moment\"". I wait; and wait. I glance toward the back area; and it looks like they are making my order. I wait; and wait. And wait some more. Finally; they come out and hand me my bag; with a \""Sorry for the SHORT wait\"" (they didn't emphasize SHORT; but I am). I glance at my clock; and I am now 17 minutes past my pick-up time. 17 minutes!!!! Meanwhile; the people who walked in the door behind me and went through the line are sitting down; halfway done with their meal. What was the point of ordering beforehand?  Will I go back to this Chiptole? Probably. But I'll only do it when I have plenty of time; and I definitely won't be pre-ordering.""",0

-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,1. The tomatillo red is the absolute best. I could eat it on anything.  2. They have a great app for your phone. It stores your favorite order; your card # (if you want); and you just click; send the order; walk in; laugh at everyone waiting in line; and get your food.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,"I LOVE this place!  I could eat here every day!  I never have any problems getting in and ordering.  The staff are very nice and friendly.  My favorite dish is the chicken bowl and chips.  I love Chipotle's \Food with Integrity\"" motto.  Chipotle isn't just good for me but good towards the animals and the environment!""",1
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,I LOVE Chipotle. I'd give most Chipotles at least 4 stars (probably five).  Food-wise this Chipotle is no different than any other location (solid & 5-star worthy).  However; I've been to this location one time. In addition to my burrito bowl & mom's 3 soft tacos we ordered chips and salsa. Got home; opened the bag; no chips & salsa (granted; I probably should have paid attention to make sure they were placed in the bag...they were on the receipt). First impressions are everything; and this oversight left me cold to this Chipotle :(,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,"I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to review Chipotle. Are you wondering why I'm reviewing a spot that is practically common knowledge to most people out there? Well; I figured that there's got to be just one person who looks on Yelp and who doesn't know about Chipotle. So for that one person; here is my review.   Once you've seen one Chipotle; you've seen them all. Similar to most chains out there; each Chipotle mirrors the next. It's the same food; the same service and the same experience. In Chipotle's case; this is a good thing because I know what I'm getting when I step through those doors. Chipotle kept me fed in college and it continues to feed me when I'm on the go and need some food quickly. It's a couple steps above drive-through and the ingredients are always fresh. You can even go healthy (kind of ) if you scratch the tortillas; avoid the sour cream and chips and focus on the proteins and veggies.   Now for the one person out there who has never had Chipotle; the system is \cafeteria-style\"" where you first choose the type of meal (burrito; bowl or tacos); then you go down the line and pick your meat and toppings. It's pretty basic. I'm kind of the Chipotle weirdo of the bunch because I'm not a fan of their burritos. They are the size of a mini van and just too much for me. I'm also not a fan of the beans and rice at Chipotle. Like I said; I'm a weirdo. I typically opt for either the soft tacos or the bowl and choose chicken; add peppers/onions; add the pico and medium salsa; corn; lettuce and I can't keep myself from adding guacamole.   I suggest Chipotle when you're feeling lazy; you're hungry and you want some solid and decent. You won't get mind blowing; but you'll leave full and satisfied. *** You'll also be need of a mint or gum stat.""",0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,Hello. I have been to this store 3 different time in the past 3 weeks. Including today. Everytime I order I give specific instructions and it is always wrong. The staff becomes rude and at times unwilling to fix the issue. It is rare a staff member will actually remedy the issue. Today I ordered online. I was unable to provide all my notes so I called in and have the remaining instructions. The staff did not give me the extra 2 tortillas I requested. I did not get extra rice or extra corn. Upon arrival at 815 my order was still not ready even though online states my order would be ready by 815. It took an additional 15 minutes. The last time I went here about 1 week prior. The staff did not include my extra tortilla( I called in my order to not have to wait) they also did not put my salsa on the side like requested. I choose to call ahead or order online because I am allergic to dairy. This requires cleaning the area and changing gloves. The staff becomes disgruntled and seeming unwilling to want to do this process. I am made to feel very uncomfortable because of my diet. To avoid being out in the most awkward and uncomfortable position I am forced to call in or place my order online. I love the way chipotle tastes. But the staff has made me uncomfortable in numerous locations and always messes up my Order. I am extremely unhappy.,0
-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,"Chipotle is no secret place; but maybe I can still give my 2-cents worth and readers may still find it worthwhile. I go to this particular Chipotle during my lunchtime half-hour during those days I don't bring my lunch which for me is few and far between. Chipotle in general is great because it can be healthy fastfood eating. It's healthy depending on what combination you put together. One of the great things about Chipotle is they aim for ingredients grown within 100 miles; warning - that doesn't necessarily mean ALL of their ingredients are fresh. They also aim towards making their newer facilities \Green\"".  My particular experience with this location has been great overall. First of all; it's really awesome that I can pay for pick-up on their website and select the time that I would like to pick up; second; it's really awesome that I can go straight to the counter to pick up. I always order the same thing: chicken bowl with veggies; no rice; no sour cream; black beans; mild or hot salsa; cheese; and avocado; which is about a buck or two extra. My tip here is when ordering online; you may want to specify you would like your bowl filled up because on two different occassions they fed me like I was ordering a side. I finally learded my lesson.""",0
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Have come to this location in the past and today I had the worst service experience in my life. There were 2 employees that very rudely handled a request that was very small. Then when I let him know he was out of line; he became even more rude. Between arguing with me and not listening and having to ring me up twice that was enough to make me want to walk out. THEN one of the employees involved had the gall to come over and asked how we were while we were eating. I let him know the food is fine but that does not change my thoughts that I will never come back to this location. THEN when my husband went to get a lid they gave him a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free.... As one last sad attempt to save themselves. I personally will never step foot in this location again and will rethink even choosing Chipotle as a whole. If this is how the company trains their staff then I will not support or contribute too. Goes back to a simple rule when it comes to service; it's not what you are saying but how you say it.,0
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Great food with quality service. We are happy to have an excellent Chipotle near our house tucked in the Norterra area!,1
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Good food; best to go when they're inbetween meal rushes.  This way you're not getting pushed through the line and miss out on specific items or extra helpings. Ingredients are a bit better than what you may expect at other chain burrito cafeteria.    Manager has tendency to penny pinch the extra salsa requests.   If you see him; try to wait until he's distracted.  You'll be able to identify him by the way he hovers over the other staff.  Otherwise; the employees are usually really friendly with special requests and aim to please.  Sometimes items mix when serving; so if you have allergies pay attention to what they're scooping onto your order.  Restaurant is kept clean.,1
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Can't beat the iPhone app/online ordering!,0
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,I feel weird writing such an awesome review for a fast-food joint but I love this location. I frequently order online or via the iPhone app. Today; I arrived 5-min early to pick up my order and they gave me a free large beverage while I waited. In the past; I arrived about 10-min late because I got stuck at work and they insisted on scrapping my order and making me a new one so that it would be fresh. AWESOME! Businesses don't do cool things like that when it is their fault; much less when it's the customer's fault. I'm hooked on Chipotle. If this location wants to round my bill up to the next nickel or whatever that controversy was - go right ahead!,0
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,The name of the game for fast food companies like Chipotle is consistency.  And as you might imagine; a company that was invested in heavily by Mickey D's; you can count on consistency at each location and this one is no different.  The quality of the ingredients is what really separates Chipotle from their competition; the meat; cheese; salsas; etc was just wonderful.  Every time I eat at a Chipotle I feel like I've eaten the best ingredients available.  Love their ice tea; seems to marry perfectly with their burritos and bowls.  The corn salsa paired with the medium salsa over chicken is terrific.  They will always give you a little extra of each ingredient if you ask (meat however is an extra charge).  This location always seems to have a ton of counter help at the rush hour to get you through the line quickly; much appreciated.  The tables are clean and the condiment area is as well.    Cops always seem to be at this location; added bonus to see sidearms in public from those in Blue-thanks for your service!,0
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Usually this Chipotle is spot on with great service and great food; however my last visit yielded different results.  You know what you get at chipotle; and you see it made. How can you go wrong?  With the service; that's how. When you have 6; mostly chatty teenage girls by the way; standing in a line waiting to help someone; and NO ONE is in line ordering; things can go very; very wrong.   For instance; when I step up to get my burrito I expect complete attention from the tortilla warmer. I shouldn't have to wait 30 seconds for you to finish your conversation about the latest gossip. When I move down the line; I expect my burrito to be artfully and deliciously crafted in front of me; not to be flung aside while you talk about another important aspect of your Saturday-night binge drinking session.   Continuing down the line; you would think this was getting a little ridiculous; but NO! My burrito waits yet again; lustfully awaiting its slathering of sour cream; salsa and cheese; to the tune of who is going out tonight as well. I thought you all went out last night? Surely you can't go out again... with hangovers! To be young again...  Finally my burrito is in the home-stretch; and what happens?! It rips. All that hard work by hungover teenage girls ruined! RUINED! I can't possibly imagine my burrito nirvana going away any quicker. It's just not the same when they rip. And it was completely avoidable BY NOT MAKING ME WAIT FOR EACH STAGE FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL CRAP THAT I DONT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT!  I will go back; because I do lust after the chicken and carnita goodness that awaits; but maybe I should go when it's actually busy and someone in charge is actually in the line...,0

6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,I absolutely love Chipotle and this is the location I go to often with my family. They are very friendly; service is great; and the food is AMAZING!! I definitely will be returning again and again! We love CHIPOTLE!!!!,1
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,"Getting to this particular location is half the battle. As other reviews have noted; it shares a parking lot with Best Buy; Buffalo Wild Wings; Chase Bank; Mellow Mushroom; Johnny Rocket and other locations... however Chipotle; despite being right next door to Best Buy with a lot front location has the longest walk to the door. Not to mention; regardless of where you park; you have to walk past a set of dumpsters.  This location does offer online ordering. That's a great thing these days for people on the go; however EVERY TIME I order online I end up waiting longer than if I were to just in line. Each online order I've placed has caused me to wait an additional 15 minutes on top of the half hour recommended wait by the website; I.E.: If I order at 5:00 the website will say \you're food will be ready for pick up at 5:30\"". When I arrive at 5:30 I find out my order hasn't even been looked at and the cashier has a look of shock on their face; and I don't get my food until 5:45. Instead of rushing my order; they put it through the line with the other people standing in line. At the longest; I've counted as many as 6 people going through the line while I waited for my online order. While the staff usually gives me a free drink to keep me calm I look at this as putting a band-aid on the situation while I'm standing there looking like a crazy person waiting on my food.  One time this happened and the manager actually ran out to me to in the parking lot and he was VERY apologetic. He gave me a coupon for a free taco/burrito/bowl to get me to come back. Well at much chagrin; I went back. This time I stood in line instead of ordering online so I could get out quicker. At the register I presented my \""free food\"" coupon. The cashier looked at it and handed it back to me saying \""this is a buy one get one free coupon if you want we can make you another burrito so this will be legit.\"" I looked over the coupon and no where on it could I see a \""buy one get one free\"". I showed the cashier and she stood her ground on it. I asked if her manager was available and she said; \""no; are you not going to pay because if you're not I'll need you to move so I can help the next customer.\"" I left my food on the counter and passed the coupon on to a group of fire fighters standing in line.  Well; I went home and promptly e-mailed Chipotle's corporate headquarters and explained everything. Within 20 minutes I was in dialogue with the regional manager. She contacted the branch manager; the one who gave me the \""free\"" coupon. He knew exactly who I was according to the regional manager. She personally sent me a stack of coupons for free food and forced the branch manager to train all the staff there on how to process the coupons and how to treat patrons.  Ok; so this time around I went in armed to the teeth in coupons and piss and vinegar. I went through the line. The tortilla guy; as usual rushed me through in a whirl of incoherent muttering about what I wanted on my three burritos. The meat and veggie guy didn't miss a beat on my orders. He saw the coupons and actually seemed stoked that I had them. I got to the cashier and he just looked pissed that I had them and took his sweet time processing them. Then charged me $6.24 for guacamole. Mike; the branch manager saw this as he was leaving his office and told the cashier to comp the guac because it just looked stupid to ring up 3 burritos and chips and salsa and drinks for free and then charge for guac.  So I recommend Chiptole for their food because it is good and  you get what want the way you want it. The service at this particular location; in stark contrast to their food; sucks. They are quick to argue with the customer when their manager is not present yet tuck their tales when he is around. If you have a coupon; prepare for battle. Do not bother ordering online. They will lose or forget your order and just make you wait longer. Going through the line is actually quicker regardless of how long the line is.""",0

6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Service isn't always as great as the food. Depending on the worker the experience could be pleasant or offensive.,0
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Chipotle has the best food of any major chain.  This location is always clean; and the food is always fresh.  I go to this location probably 2-4 times a month.  My problem is the service is usually not so great.  I mean I am a regular see the same people; order the same thing and except for a few of the girls they all seem to be more interested in talking to each other than serving the customer.  There is one guy who wears glasses who always works the register.  I would fire that guy; he has the worst customer service of everyone in that place.,0

The rice is not too oily & the beans are not too salty.  Everything seems fresh; compared to other locations.  One big plus for me; when ordering a vegetarian burrito; I am NOT asked \what kind of meat\"".  As far as service goes; the people working here are very nice & they actually listen to you request.

6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,Great store; fast service; friendly people. Tables are cleaned fast. Wish there was more room between the close tables; and more tables. Maybe they can buy the old chop chop next door.,1
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,"Like every other Chipotle I've been to; the food was good. The service here was pretty good; all server's had smiles on their faces; but the location; the location. I almost missed it. The parking isn't very good as its shared with numerous other \mall like\"" eateries and shops; and the signage seems poor as well.   I wanted so bad to give this Chipotle 5 stars for the great service but I just couldn't overlook the poor location. Eat here if you can find it (and parking).""",1
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,"Chipotle; you're either a fan or not a fan...  Like them or not they have a unique taste and style about how they serve fresh and quality ingredients.  The staff in this particular location is super friendly; but not overly so. Like when I show up two days in a row; they don't even look at you funny. They are very accommodating and their smiles are genuine.  You can get as creative as you want when ordering; your imagination and tummy size are your only limits.  If you ask for \a little\"" they give you a little; if you ask for \""a little more\"" they oblige you there too.    The menu is simple. You can order tortilla chips; a burrito (your choice of meat; beans; salsas; opt for lettuce; sour cream; shredded cheese and; for an extra fee; guacamole;) a fajita burrito (which substitutes the beans for grilled sliced peppers and onions) a burrito or fajita burrito 'bol' (which are the same ingredients sans tortilla; in an Atkins (low carb)-friendly cardboard dish;) or tacos.   All besides the chips; your food is made fresh as it moves down a line of people putting this in; slapping that on; or wrapping it all up.) If you get there right when they open the chips are so fresh that the bags are still warm. They offer ice tea; fountain drinks and a small selection of bottled beers like Corona and Dos Equis.  The carnitas burrito bowl with grilled veggies; little rice; no beans; extra cilantro; both mild and hot sauce; cheese; sour cream and more cilantro on top is my fav. With chips and guac (and it's really good guac); it's a meal that keeps me full all day long.  WHOO HOO!!""",1
6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,"Always a fan of Chipotle.  This place had some service issues when they first opened; but that has changed since then; so they get the 4 star review. :)  What's really cool about this place is that they have the \pre-order pickup window\"".

6TWRuHn24DL6vnW8Uyu4Vw,This restaurant is AMAZING! We eat here regularly and recently had a big event and they handled the catering. Megan; the take out manager; really went above and beyond. She not only made sure our order was perfect (after some initial confusion); but she came in on her day off to do so. I love that your staff is so dedicated to their job and their customers that they will come in on a Sunday to help with a special catering order. This really says a lot about this location and their leadership. I cannot thank Megan; and Chipotle; enough; as the party was a success and everyone loved the food!,1
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Nice pleasant drive thru attendant.  Quick and efficient service.  They ask if you're eating in the car and offer you a lap mat (see picture).  I like to ask for grilled onions and extra spread.  They are always obliging.  Plus; the food is good. Duh.,1
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Steps to a enjoying successful In-N-Out Burger.   1. Get drunk first; this will help your enjoyment of the burger.   2. make sure its late at night so that you are surrounded by more drunk people like you and less teenagers and families.   3. order the double double animal style (with fries and a drink if you are feeling fancy) and get it TO GO.   4. Drive (or if you are too drunk have someone drive for you) home. At this point; you will start to smell the tasty scent of fresh burger with onions and cheese. You are probably dying to rip the paper bag open and devour your burger. but resist. enjoy the smell build-up and tell your burger how much you are going to enjoy eating him/her when you get home.   5. get home and open your burger. Hold it with both hands. For epic classiness; make sure both your pinkies are raised because; after all; you are a lady/gentleman who knows who to eat a burger properly.   6. Make sure you have drowned your burger with extra SPREAD (the thousand island sauce that you have to ask for when you get your burger TO GO). Let the spread and burger drippings fall down the side of your mouth and lick your fingers once you are down.   7. Calm down. control the foodgasm- other people may be watching you and getting the hell creeped out.,0
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Had to try In-N-Out Burger during our vacation; how could you not? Solid burger; yummy fries.  I'm always down for a chocolate shake but I don't order them if I'm splurging on a burger; so had to skip that. Really loved the homemade bun for my regular cheeseburger. Toppings were fresh and tasty; next time I'd get onions too. Liked the outdoor seating in the sunshine. I've had better burgers; but as far as fast food goes this place would defintely come out on top.,
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,OHHHHHHHHHH BABY!!!! I love me some InNOut Burger.  Growing up in Arizona we didn't have InNOut Burger; so when we went to So Cal to visit family; the daily trips to InNOut were like mini vacations within our vacation.  You can imagine how happy I was when they started opening them in the Valley.  I absolutely love this place.  Try something off the secret menu.  3x3; 4x4; animal style; well done fries... grilled cheese! yup!  The service is always good; the restaurants are always clean; and the food is always fresh.  Can't ask for much more.,1
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,"Great and fast service. Tons of people here during lunch time but thats not a reason to dock stars. We were fortunate to get seats as a table was leaving. Line was out the door but the food came quickly. Excellent service and delicious food. Highly recommended: get extra \spread\"" packets for burgers and fries (their special sauce).""",1
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,"Okay. These guys are the best when it comes to the late-night rush (4 cars in the drive-thru at 12:30 AM).

Yesterday service was particularly good and the nice gentleman that took our order came around to make sure that we were doing good. He was friendly and made good conversation.

LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Prob one of the best of the fast food type burger places but way overrated. They definitely have a cult following.  I have to say the burger is really good especially as animal style (one of the not so secret menu options). It is so small though you have to get at least a double or even a triple to be satisfied (3x3 good option). So once you have ordered a 3x3; animal style you got a nice sized burger that has all the right cheese gooeyness; grilled onion and sauce to boot. (prob is it hikes up the price).  I have to say the fries just suck (these are fighting words to the in-n-out lovers). They are cut fresh but they don't cook them right. They are soggy little suckers so i have to say Fry well (or well done) to get them in some sort of crispiness but then they are almost cooked to much. So i usually don't order anymore. They need to learn how to do the twice cook method (blanch then crisp)  Shakes are ok but nothing special what so ever. I do like how they have little hot yellow chiles if you want them.,0
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,"This is what I consider the best of the the \fast food\"" burger joints; except it's not really that fast.  Very simple and tasty menu; with secret ways of ordering.  Try the \""Double-Double; animal style\"" sometime....yum!  You can baiscally get burgers; fries; sodas and shakes here...and that is the whole menu.  All the locations I've been to have pretty much been the exact same...slow and tasty!  Oh; and they are open LATE!""",0
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,In-N-Out is an In-N-Out; only difference is it is in AZ which until maybe ten years ago wasn't so. My buddy used to come to Cali and go right from the airport to In-N-Out but now he has one in his own back yard to gorge on. I like to order a 3X3 protein style when I come here after a good workout. If I am having fast food this is the place to choose for sure for a burger. Clean location; good service; a little slow but why rush excellence???,1

LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Tried In and Out after a year hiatus. Don't know why; just none near me or near work. Arrived at 12:45PM on a Thursday and there were 35 inside plus 25 cars lined up around the corner.   Ordered a Double-double Animal style and small drink for $5.19. The menu is small but they are good at what they do.   My sandwich arrived in seven minutes; fresh and hot. To you noobs out there: don't take it out of the wrapper. It's too juicy; stuffed and fresh to hold up without it.   My burger was animal style; which means grilled onions. The bun was toasted with lots of crisp; cold lettuce; sliced tomato; pickles and relish plus thousand island dressing. Very messy.   Never a complaint here. The fries are good too; I just wasn't hungry enough for them.,0
LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Awesome food but if you get animal style on the burger/cheeseburger; it's free! If you get animal style on the fries; it is a $2.05 mark up for an upgrade... Wth? That's ridiculous! I could understand $.50 or $1 but $2.05???? Crazy!!  I just got my food and they got my order wrong... Jeez,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,This was our first visit here; and I couldn't find anything wrong with it...hence the 5 stars.  We decided to head downtown on a Sunday afternoon to try out their burgers.  Good idea; since the parking garage was empty (plus free).  We were greeted warmly when we walked in; and explained about their ordering system.  I decided on a little cheeseburger with grilled onions and light on the ketchup/mustard.  My husband went with the regular cheeseburger with lettuce; tomato and ketchup.  We ordered one regular fry for the 2 of us (we were told it would be A LOT); plus 2 drinks.  The restaurant was practically empty; only a few other patrons already in there; and it was nice and cold (which I love!).  The music was blaring; and had a fun vibe to it.  When our food was ready; it was steaming hot and delicious!  He wasn't kidding when he said there'd be a lot of fries!  They prepped my cheeseburger perfectly; the ketchup and mustard added lightly.  I love when a restaurant listens to how I order something...thank you for that!  We both really enjoyed the food; and everything was cooked to perfection.    I read some other reviews; and a number of people complained about soggy fries.  We didn't have those at all.  I like crispy fries; so I pulled out those first; but I'll admit; there wasn't a bad fry in the batch.  We both enjoyed them immensely; and finished them off...not too salty and not soggy at all.  We'll definitely be making another trip downtown on a weekend when we want burgers & fries.  Five Guys deserves five stars!!,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,I love Five Guys! Their burgers are always fresh along with everything else.   For first timers I must warn you that there are no combos; so everything is separate: burgers; fries; and drinks.  When I had came with my boyfriend there was no line and I orderd a little bacon cheeseburger because their regular hamburgers come with 2 beef patties and 1 is way more than enough for me!   Although there weren't a lot of people there it did take a while for us to get our food. And 1 thing that I will admit that I don't like about Five Guys is that they wrap your burgers in foil; which tends the make the bread soggy and by the time you're finished enjoying your bombtastic burger it can be a sloppy mess and not really appealing to look at. Plus there is no free parking nearby.  Besides that Five Guys is a good burger place; it might not be the end all to all other burger places but it definitely has potential to be in anyone's top choices!,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Sorry; but we don't see what all the hype is about! We've gone twice now & the burgers seem similar to Carl's Jr. Okay I admit; the fries ARE great & they give you a LOT; but I sill LOVE IN-N-OUT's Double-Double faaaar more!  Five Guys doesn't even have shakes! IN-N-OUT's shakes ROCK; as they use real ice cream & they're thick! ...They are also pricy; too!  ...A double cheese burger & a reg order of fries was over $9! We will most likely not return to Five Guys....IN-N-OUT...here we come!  :),0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"This downtown location is almost always busy.  In a very nice corner of a nice new shopping/dining/pedestrian mall.  Outside seating nice; inside is nice.  It's new; so shiny; bright; clean.  I live two blocks way; and dine here about once a week.  A regular double cheeseburger with back and \all the way\"" topings and regular fries will feed two modestly hungry people; say a skinny woman and man; with fries to spare.   $12.  Get two regular burgers and fries; add 3 or 4 bucks; and you've got a rich meal.    The burgers are great for fast food.  Better than in n out; better than any other fast food burger.  Fries are $2.50 but they serve like the equivalent of 2-3 extra large McDonalds fries portions; so it feeds me; the wife; and two small kids and we are stuffed.    They serve peanuts in the shell for a fun; messy way to pass the time waiting for the burgers to cook; and you can easily wait 10-15 minutes for your food to be ready.    Overally; the only negative is that these guys make such huge margins... charging $12 for a burger and fries in a fast food setting feels like highway robbery.  They get away with it because the quality is outstanding.    But honestly; I could get a better burger and fries; for about the same price; at a great restaurant.    So you be the judge.  If you are a quality over quantity person in terms of bang for your buck; then come here and endulge.  But this would be an expensive lunch habit if you work downtown and eat here often.  Of course you'd likely drop dead from a coronary far before you went broke.  And for the love of god don't order online.  They just hold your order until you arrive; as people have complained otherwise that the fries aren't fresh.  It maybe saves 5 minutes off the process; and of course waiting in line; but unless you are going during lunch rush hour; just head down there with a book or a companion.""",0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"Not great; not awful.  I just wasn't terribly impressed.... everyone keeps telling me how great their fries are but I didn't think they were anything special.   They do give you a TON of them.... my husband and I split a large order of the Cajun fries and only finished about 1/3 of what they gave us.     I did appreciate the large array of toppings available to customize the burger to your liking; especially fresh jalapenos.  Next time I'll skip the fries and stick to the single burger; which for a \fast food\"" burger was pretty tasty!""",0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Good burger; awful fries; high prices. Since I appear to be the only person I know not on the Five Guys bandwagon; I decided to give this location a try. I'm still not jumping on board.   There's nothing wrong with the location. Cityscape is a great spot in downtown Phoenix. Perfect for the busy lunch crowd; and Five Guys is open for dinner and on weekends. For a fast food burger in this area; it pretty much is as good as it gets. The location is very clean and the staff was very friendly. My walking distance options are Five Guys and McDonald's; Five Guys is always going to win that fight.   As I stated earlier; the burger itself is good. I learned my lesson from the Scottsdale location; and ordered the Little Hamburger this time. It's a good size and not too unreasonably priced; but still more than I want to pay for a quick service meal. The huge amount of toppings are wonderful (but I cannot figure out how all the toppings are free yet cheese is an additional 60 cents). It's also a little too messy and greasy to me; but that's probably what appeals to others.   The big problem I have with Five Guys is the fries. Why is there no small? The amount that comes in a regular order is way too much. While you certainly get the value of what you pay for in the quantity; there should be a smaller and cheaper option. You also do not get the value of what you pay for in quality. This time I experimented with the Cajun Fries. Just awful. Way too overseasoned and soggy. I left out the cup so my coworkers could finish them off. Not too many people seemed interested.   A little more than seven dollars for a burger and an unnecessary amount of fries. No drink (had water back at my office). More money than I want to spend on greasy fast food. But (if you didn't get enough food); there's also complimentary (very salty) peanuts you can gnaw on; too.,1

qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,They say they open at 11 AM; but they were already roaring busy when I arrived at 11 today.  The service was friendly; & there are free; tasty peanuts in the shell to help yourself to; to hold you over while they fix your burger.  Their regular burger comes piled up to the sky with two meat patties & your choice of as many of the FIFTEEN add-ons that you want.  I ordered mine with mayo; lettuce; pickles; tomatoes; grilled mushrooms; ketchup; relish; & diced raw onions.  I also ordered a regular fries; Five Guys style.  While you munch on a few peanuts; FOURTEEN people run around behind the counter making your burger (while still others scurry around the in the nice dining area keeping everything in top shape)!  In a little while my order was ready.  It comes bagged up to go; with your MONSTER burger wrapped in aluminum foil; & the big order of fries way overflowing the cup it is served in.  I started on the fries first.  They come well browned; with peels on; & they're 5-Stars; straight up!  With its terrific tasting meat & everything else; this big boy beat even the Smokehouse Burger at Bobby-Q ($10) to become the best hamburger I've ever eaten!  I think it's absolutely worth the money:  (Double) Hamburger $5.09; Fries (plenty for 2 people) $2.59  (Enter the restaurant from near the corner of Washington Bv. & 1st Av.; arriving between 10:30 & 11 AM if you can; as by 11:30 this morning the line was WAY out the door!)     :-)),1

qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Wasn't impressed....my first time at Five Guys and not sure if it was the chain overall or the location. Service was good; so I'm thinking I'm just an In N Out girl? Ordered a bacon cheeseburger; fries; and drink. Burger was just ok (way too big for me with the double patty; but I thought it'd be a single); fries were not good...just too expensive for what I got,1

qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Tried this in Tempe but in a quick moment of haste I asked for the works and it came that way - my mistake as I hate ketchup and Mayo on burgers as it disguises the flavors and both were included; but that was my fault.  Vowed to try it again and when I did I omitted those offenders and it was great.  Came out promptly; result was good; tasty and far better than the competition (In-N-out ).  Mid priced burger was good value and the burger seemed of comparable caliber for price.  The meat was flavorful; the bun soft and they sported crisp veggies.  Order was exactly correct on delivery. A bit pricey; but not that bad overall.  Free peanut starters are a real plus as you wait - somebody was thinking on their toes for both client's hunger and preoccupation.   PS - Note on comments that compare this place to In-N-Out ; I do not consider them competition as I have seen In-N-Out as a filthy; dirty place where fries are scooped across the counter and back into the serving bin.  I searched on In 'N Out's website and it doesn't allow you to report it (like they don't care.  end of rant).,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Great Food! Great Service! We packed the place out with students/parents attending a conference at the Convention Center and Five Guys whipped through the crowd in lightning speed! Great atmosphere and an abundance of fries!!!,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Fan of Five Guys and adding all the toppings you can have on your burger without paying extra for it. Also love the fact they fill your bag up with fries; some of you neat freaks may not like this but re heated in a toaster oven they are even better. My recommendation is to share an order of fries because they really give you a lot. Also the drink machines are very futuristic at some locations don't be afraid to call for help if you don't know what you are doing.   This is good burger. I think it is better then Applebee's or Chile's and half the cost.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,This place was a total waste of time.  My friend and I did a long bike ride; and found ourselves craving burgers.  We considered our options; and decided to go with Five Guys because it was close to my house; would give us  a chance to check out Cityscape; and our president famously ate there shortly after taking up residence in the White House.  I am SO not impressed.  I ordered the little burger; which is a single patty; and the fries.  I got way too many fries; and there wasn't any ranch dressing evident into which I could dip them.  So; I was not inclined to eat my fries at all.  The burger was ok.  The big sacks of potatoes in the middle of the restaurant was not appealing (pun intended).  The place was noisy; the music was too loud for conversation.  And the Cityscape development is lame.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Good burger but they don't do the best on getting orders correct.  There were 3 of us and only one person had their order correct.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,I got asked for money 3 times by homeless people between the curb and the door. Once inside; the music was so loud; the staff was actually yelling to be heard and take an order. A bacon cheeseburger and drink (no fries) was $10.70; and was really bland. I don't understand how anyone likes this place or it stays in business.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"The location of this Five Guys was great; as it was right downtown amidst many other great places. The service was splendid. The food was good; it was better than a normal fast-food burger; but definitely not worth the price I paid for it. The cajun fries are great; you get well beyond the price you pay in fries. I got a \little fry\"" that I was told \""feeds one person\"". I could have fed two guys off of those fries (and I can eat a lot of fries). I am so glad that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine! I have used this machine in another restaurant in Tennessee and became fascinated with it. You can pretty much make some crazy drink combinations; I had a Peach Mello Yello.   Overall; the food was great but not worth the price I paid. Would I go back? Sure; but not often. Would I recommend it to other people? Yes; but with an indication of the prices.""",1
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"After a cool night of sampling drinks and treats at the very first Yelp Helps event at CityScape (downtown); I thought I finally try this place since it's so conveniently nearby.  Well; with mediocre expectations actually; I was not impressed with their BURGER.  I was really; really hoping that it would be better than this! Really! :)  I ordered their \Little\"" cheese burger; which is a single patty burger.  I added my favorite toppings; mushrooms and onions; no extra cost (btw).  For sides; I ordered their Regular Cajun Fries that came in like a 16 oz. cup.  Excellent; seasoned very well and soft and tasted very; very POTATO-ee.  I would go back just for that.  The two problems to me were the BUNs and the PATTY.  If I didn't know any better; the buns were made of saw dust or card board! During the process of them compiling the burger; I did not see them toasting or buttering the buns like most places would.  The patty was not juicy or had that beefy flavor; I tasted mostly the DRY buns.  Same applied to my toppings; the mushrooms and onions. I felt the buns overrode everything!  Victory to the FRIES.""",0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"I had a hankering for a better burger than typical fast food; and Five Guys was in the neighborhood and worthy of a first time check out.  And it is; if you haven't been before.    But despite the rave restaurant reviews utterly plastered on almost every open space on the wall; this place is totally overrated.      The burger wasn't bad.  I dig all the fix-ins you can put on them; but it makes for a pretty messy eating experience.    Unfortunately; the burgers are way overpriced for what they really are--as another reviewer put it it; it really is a step up from Carl's Jr.    I ordered what should have been a \pretty big\"" burger and it said I got two patties on the receipt; but in retrospect I think I got shorted cause the second one was much bigger.     Whatever the case; after two $6 burgers; I was still hungry.   That shouldn't happen in fast food places like this.  In-N-Out is twice the good deal this place is.      I did not try the fries... I thought I ordered them; but in fact did not because I didn't shout that I wanted fries.  Five Guys is annoyingly loud.   Some day I will understand the onslaught of overplayed classic rock played in practically every eating establishment these days.  It's getting annoying; especially when it causes order fuckups.   The service was quick and really friendly.   And I like the free peanuts.   It makes me think my two-star rating is a little low; but the soda machine tasted like soap and some bedraggled man took his sweet time in the *one* bathroom they had available.      And ultimately; it is an expensive burger that would have been forgettable if I didn't have a particular fondness for A-1 sauce and 'shrooms.  I could only see myself going again if I were stuck on the corner; needed to eat quick; already ate at Chipotle's; and had some money to burn; all of which are a stretch for me; but probably not  the upper middle-classed downtown lunch crowd.     And that lunch crowd must be exactly this place's target market--with all of the above being said; you're probably not going to find a better; quicker burger within a short walk from the Washington St office towers.  The plethora of fast convenience stores on the ground floor of Block 77; brought to us by CityScape's cynical over-commercialism; is not without its utility to some people.    For anybody else; I wouldn't bother a second time.    3/10.""",1

qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"I don't get to Five Guys as often as I should; mainly because they started out my way on the east coast and are pretty much everywhere.  So I basically ended up with a case of burnout.  But since it was National Cheeseburger Day; and we were on a tight schedule for lunch; we decided to stop in since it was only a block or so from our hotel.  The thing to realize about Five Guys is that a \little\"" cheeseburger is actually a normal-sized burger anywhere else.  A regular burger there is actually two patties.  So from there I went with a little bacon cheeseburger; with all of the fixings.  And I immediately realized my mistake in overlooking how good Five Guys is.  It was just a delicious burger; perfectly moist; and bursting with flavor.  Hotdogs have always seemed to be a weak spot and that was still the case at this location.  For as complex and delicious as the burgers are; the dogs are always plain and one note.  Even loading them up with toppings doesn't help.  Note that an order of fries is a massive portion.  You can choose between regular or cajun; but either way you'll have your fill of carbs for about a week.  But don't make my mistake and overlook FG.""",0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"I had only eaten at a 5 Guys twice before.  Once was lunch on Mill Avenue; the other was breakfast in National Airport near DC.  (Breakfast items are not on the menu at most locations.)  This is often compared to In-n-Out and I think that the comparison is fair.  The burgers are comparable; but there are so many options that it takes a while to figure out how you want it.  The standard hamburger is actually two patties; so one might want to order a \small\"" hamburger or cheeseburger if they are not accustomed to ordering a double meat burger.  The fries are; in my opinion; much better than In-n-Out.  (The fries at In-n-Out have always been a week point unless you order them Well Done or Well Light off the secret menu.) The Regular order of fries is huge.  Next time we will order one Large for two people.  As a Dbacks season ticket-holder; this place will be handy before games.  My first visit was to get carryout and the shortcoming there is that they don't validate parking.  Your choices are to street park (I got a spot on Adams at First Ave) or to park in the garage and pick up something at CVS; which does validate.  For carryout; we will definitely be back.  There is no In-n-Out in the vicinity; Lenny's Burgers are somewhat inconsistent; and there is a slight edge over Whataburger.""",0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"This In-N-Out wannabe is not worth the money.  No specials so you have to buy the burger; fries and drink separtely.  Food was not worth the $12 you end up paying.  They DO give you a lot of fries; but quantity is not worth the quality...greasy and soggy.   They also don't tell you their burger is a double burger.  That would've been nice to know and I would've ordered a \little burger\"". Will NEVER go back.""",0

Well; we went here before a Suns game last week and I must say; it blew me away.  The burger is; by far; the best fast food burger I've had.  It was made to order and I had all the toppings I love.  I got the \""little\"" cheese burger with hot sauce (oh so good) and grilled onions and mushrooms.  We shared regular fries and they too were sooo... good!    So; for what it is; Five Guys is great!

qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Yes; their burgers are great!  There; I said it.  I'm not a burger lover.  So; take that with a grain of salt.  I'd usually stay away from chains; but on a long drive through Phoenix; I just wanted to drive by and see what downtown looks like.  It's a Saturday after all; and the usual crowd I figured would be away. Come for the burgers; made in different ways the way you wish.  The fries are great; too.  I didn't get a chance to read Yelp before hand; so we ended up ordering two small fries.  The brown bag was so heavy with about 2 lbs of fries.  The good part; they are good; too. I liked that they served several types of tea.  Plus point for that. I was worried about the signs posted all over the restaurant; though.  Is this really their ambiance else where?  Someone join me in telling the chain to get rid of the testimonials by newspapers and magazines on the walls.  It's okay to be good; but tacky to use clippings all over your walls saying so.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,We absolutely love going here prior to a Rattler's or D-Backs game!  Location is great; burgers are fresh;hot & yummy!!  A small order of fries is more than enough for 2 people to share...especially if you get the double patty burger.  Fries are cut fresh there.  We feel it's a great deal for the money!,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,I tried out this place when I was in Baltimore last winter.  It is good; but not the best burger for the money.  The price is right for what you get for the money.  Once you add fries and a drink you are at $10.00; still not too bad.  I ordered the cheese burger.  I enjoyed have grilled mushrooms and onions on my burger; but the overall taste was bland.  The fries did not really have too much flavor.    The place is crowded; but they move you along in an orderly manner.  It can be a challenge to find setting during lunch hour.  However; I was able to find a place to sit quickly.  I do not have all that much to say.  The menu is limited and they provide free peanuts.,1
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,WORST BURGER EVER!!! I'd rather have a .99 burger from McDonalds.  For $10ish I ordered a burger and little fries; no soft drink.  Blech. No flavor what-so-ever even though it was loaded with all sorts of stuff.  The bottom bun was soggy and turned to mush so it was impossible to pick it up and eat. I had to use a spoon. The beef was not seasoned at all and had ZERO flavor. The fries were fine.   No... These guys don't know how to make a burger not to mention a pricy one.  No...no... no... never ever again. I was robbed!,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Sadly the burger tastes a lot like Fuddruckers burgers.  Not that this is bad; it just seems like there is too much sauce going on.  Part of the problem is that you get to build your own burger and I tend to go overboard.  It is a very limited menu; the burgers come in various sizes and the fries come by the bagful.  The fries are delicious.  The lines can get really long in this location but you can order ahead on-line.  Overall; it's a good burger; but I'm not sure its worth the calories.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,I'm a vegetarian so I don't come here often but when I do I always order either a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and fresh jalapeños ; and it is always good...the cashiers are always friendly; and the wait is usually minimal...everything is pretty organized. Occasionally I will get fries but they are very filling and too greasy for frequent consumption. My only complaint is really the size of the grilled cheese sandwich. It's very small compared to the size of a veggie sandwich (with more veggies; roughly the same price) at Jimmy Johns next door,1
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Solid 2.5 stars.....3 for the online ordering system and 2 for the food. While I usually round up I decided to round down.   If I had waited in line for this I would have been even more disappointed in the quality of the food. I placed my order in online through a very user friendly process. They sent me an email confirming the pick-up time and I walked on over to pick it up. Past the early hordes of lunch time downtowners.  The website says they cook your fries once you arrive. Hummm...I doubt that...these things had been sitting around for a while; some soggy; some dry and others slightly burnt. The small serving is HUGE and good luck finding your burger in your greasy bag under all the fries. I finally tore open the bag along its side and dug everything out. Tried to salvage what was good from the fries; I choose a few soggy ones. I finally just got grossed out and tossed the fries.   Now the burger; wrapped in tin-foil; looked like someone tried to force it from hamburger shape into a round ball before putting it in the bag. When I opened the foil that is what it looked like too. A soggy mess. It was all edible with a fork. I enjoyed the thick sliced pickles and the fresh ingredients; but I thought I ordered bacon...oh wait there it is....paper thin and burnt.   Over hyped YES. If I ever get a burger craving at work again; I would rather go to the Burger King on 1st St.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,LOVE the food here. I work downtown and often go in around 1:30pm; when the lunch crowd has died down. No complaints about the food at all. Would like to see them start offering delivery like Jimmy John's does to downtown businesses. I can tell you I would order from this place a lot more often. But....TURN THAT MUSIC DOWN!!! The music is always way too loud. I should not have to yell at my lunch companion to have a conversation. Would have given 5 stars if the music wasn't causing deafness.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"So after reading some not so hot reviews; it took me a bit longer to check this place out than I normally would. I decided after a great workout at Golds; what better way to reward myself than a cheeseburger and fries! So I sauntered into 5 guys; and got down to business. I ordered the \small\"" burger; which just means that you only have one patty instead of two. They have an enormous list of toppings; I ordered it with everything. That included mayo; ketchup; mustard; pickles; lettuce; tomato; grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. They had a bunch of other toppings too; but what I had was more than enough. I decided to go with the regular fries as opposed to the cajun fries; that they're supposedly known for. I do have to say I'm always impressed when burger joints have the hand-cut fries. They were good here; not the best I've ever had; but good. (That honor goes to my fave spot back in Washington; Burger Express). The burger was good; it seemed better than most people's experiences I think. it could be that they weren't crazy busy; as it was just after they opened on a Sunday. It was just what I wanted in a burger. Juicy; messy and a decent price. I still think Lenny's burgers are way better; but the fries here get the nod. Overall a cool little spot in downtown to get a decent burger and fries.""",0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,I finally got to try the alllll so famously awesome Five Guys; I mean it has to be good if the president loves it.... meh!   So; here I am stuck down town on a particularly HOT Monday enjoying my mandatory jury duty. So not fun! I have found myself faced with 2 hours for lunch; where to go. Well; I saw Five Guys on the corner and get 'em a try. It was a zoo; line for miles and people everywhere; no ones fault but the location.   The menu is very simple; burger; cheeseburger; bacon cheeseburger; grilled cheese; hot dog; plenty of fix-ins to choose from; two sizes of fries. I ordered a cheeseburger and a regular (the smallest size) order of Cajun fries (spicy seasoning). The quality of the burger was good; however it normally comes with two patties of meat; which I do not care for. The fries were the most disappointing. They weren't cooked enough; and the bag they handed to me with full of fries; I had to go fishing for my burger. Messy and irritating.   I might try them again; but I will skip the fries and ask if I can get only one patty.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"Ross and I moved to Arizona from Arlington; VA. We use to walk to the original Five Guy's burger stand. So; you can imagine our excitement and concern to see Five Guy's become a \chain\"" and start popping up all over the valley. Frankly; I was worried that quality would suffer.   Five Guys is still exactly how I remember the experience: Long lines; simple burgers; and tons of french fries. It's a great treat and; in my opinion; surpasses In and Out Burgers.  Some tips for visiting:  1. Unless you are a big man or extremely hungry; stick with the \""Little Burger\"" (one patty).  2. ONE small order of Fries should be enough for a table of four. They give you a serving and then they dump an additional serving into the paper bag.  3. Don't visit during lunch hour during the week (anywhere between 11:30 and 1:30) -- the line and wait for a simple burger is outrageous.   We love Five Guy's -- mostly for nostalgia; but also because of the freshness and taste of the burger!!! I think your own experience and opinion will vary depending on how long you have to wait ...it IS after all only a burger.""",0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"Fatburger and In-N-Out move over!  It was the weekend of CityScapes grand opening; and one of the busiest places was this burger joint. I came here with a friend between concerts; and was amazed by how great the burgers were! Here's the rundown:  The place: nice and clean (however; it was opened for only a few days when I went). They have boxes of peanuts sitting out for you to scoop a bunch and eat while in line; or sitting and enjoying your burger. I'm not a peanut fan; but I thought it was pretty cool! However; they make a mess; even with the crew cleaning the shells up constantly.  The service: friendly and fast. Now; when I went; about half of Phoenix was in the area because of CityScape; so it did take a while to get our burgers; but that was expected with a line out the door (that formed in a matter of minutes). I'm sure on a normal day; the service would be much quicker.  The price: it's...pricey. Yes; you get a good burger; and a \Small\"" is the size of a normal burger anywhere else; but almost $6? I felt like it was just a tad but too much. However; you can get almost anything you want on the burger for no additional charge. I didn't get fries or a drink (because of the price; and I already had a Pepsi in hand).   Overall; I'm impressed. So far; Five Guys wins my vote as the best burger in Phoenix.""",1
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Stopped by while I was downtown working. It was busy; lunch hour and downtown = busy; so to be expected.  They actually messed up my order. Instead of a double bacon cheese burger they just gave me a cheese burger.  I only realized it once I was sitting outside. I just took that as a sign I shouldn't really be eating this unhealthy stuff so I just ate it; as well as the couple dollars.,0
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,I was in the area this morning and couldn't think of anywhere to eat  It was 10:58am and I was craving something that would fill me I almost went across to Chipotle but a huge burrito in the morning?   There was a couple of other people waiting to have lunch at 5guys when I was there and we were let in right at 11:00am  The cashier was nice and friendly She made sure that my order was correct and was very friendly  I got a cheeseburger with everything; minus the mushrooms I also got a little cup of fries and a soda  I love that the Coke Freestyle machines are popping up all over I was happy to have Cherry Coke  Mind you; this was all at 11:00am; don't judge me  The burger was really good; and so were the fries  I sat near the window and I was amused by watching the Jimmy John bikers make deliveries I never knew they had so many people on bikes for deliveries Nevertheless I was entertained,1
qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Take Five Guys for exactly what it is and it earns all 5 stars in my book. Despite what other reviewers think; THIS IS A FAST FOOD CHAIN! They just happen to use FRESH; quality ingredients instead of the crap you find at McDonald's or BK! You wanna compare it to something? Try In-and-Out. Which I also love. But being an East Coaster; my allegiance lies with Five Guys.   I love the Bacon Cheeseburger with fresh cut jalapenos and grilled mushrooms; accompanied by the cajun fries!! YES; the regular burger comes with 2 patties! If that's too much for you to eat then order the Little Burger. Or eat as much of the Regular as you can and throw the rest out. It's not something to whine about on Yelp and deduct stars for. The same goes for the fries... yes they give you a lot... why is that a bad thing?  If you're looking for a fresher version of a fast food burger with plenty of FREE toppings to choose from; then Five Guys is right up your alley!,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,"Went here for lunch because it was near. I had the red pepper double cheeseburger with bacon and fries and drink combo. Overpriced. Thin bacon. Nice BBQ sauce (asked for a container for the burger). Crinkle-cut fries I didn't like the taste of. Pepsi MAX tasted off. Overpriced. Near 8 bucks. You can take grandma; nice place; nice people; fast and friendly service. Clean. Overpriced. I enjoyed the burger but it went fast. Strange taste. I guess that was the \butter burger\"" taste. I'm not used to that. Overpriced. Burger King beats this place for flavor. Overpriced. Do they pay these prices in Wisconsin? I wasn't very full even after forcing down those fries.  Maybe your grandma will be.""",1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,This place is special. It has it all. Great service. Excellent burgers and frozen custard. The staff were very friendly. They bring your order to your table.  The burgers ; chicken sandwich; fries and custard  were excellent ...  Culver's Chandler is special.,1

cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,This is the newest Culver's in the area; and now it's easy to get Culverized at lunchtime as this one is very close to the office.  Tons of unhealthy comfort food here; but if you order judiciously; you can actually eat pretty healthy here.  The desserts are excellent; the seating is cozy for a fast food joint; several giant TV screens on display; and free wifi.  Brak is a Culver's fan.,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I have lived in Arizona for 11 years and have heard of Culvers from quite a few friends; all talking about the butter burger and ice cream/frozen custard; so having never been to a Culvers I thought um sounds like a cool little ice cream parlor that I should investigate.  It's Tuesday night and the kids and I don't feel like cooking and a Culvers just opened up in my area so I told them lets go for burger and shake and they said cool mom!    Imagine my shock when I walked in to find out that it's a fast food place LOL I don't know why I thought it would be an ice cream parlor. We walked up to the teller and were looking at the menu and placing our order; we were a party of 4 so it took each of us a few minutes to figure out what we want; at this point there was a customer behind us being very rude and loud and complaining about families who go to order but still have to look at the menu board; why can't they just have their order ready. Really lady? lol Some peoples kids I tell ya.  I thought since I am here I am going to try the butterburger cheese; fries and a chocolate shake!  My burger I made a single; I can't eat a double burger; it had cheese; lettuce; pickle and onion; it actually was a great burger; I was surprised. Now when I have a want for In n Out I just might head on over to Culvers. The fries; I like them; they are the crinkled cut fries they were good and the chocolate shake!! Omg soo thick and creamy! DELISH!!  Glad I finally went and checked the place out; the kids; (who are really young adults; age range frm 20 years to 16 years) loved the place too!,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Customer service was excellent; food was good. We all had burgers with cheese and fries. All items were hot and very good. My only complain was that everything seemed dirty. The bathrooms needed a good scrub and the floor and tables seemed to have a film of dirt/ grease on them.  We did enjoy the food and service; we will visit another location near our house next time.,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Oh the butterburgers and the concretes. Got to love the frozen custard concretes. That you can mix in any two things you want from there list of many. Inside tip: They also have chocolate custard not just vanilla. This I found out after a few visits. I always get chocolate custard with chocolate sauce and Oreo cookies. I think its the best. The burgers are really good. So are the onion rings and the cheese curds. I have never heard of cheese curds before Culvers. Must be a Wisconsin thing but they are really good. To call them fried cheese balls don't do them justice. Just try them. If you like cheese you will like these. The service is pretty good. Sure it takes awhile to get your food but that just means they are making it fresh. For that I am willing to wait. Plus they give you your concrete first so you can enjoy that while you pull forward in the drive thru to wait for the rest of your order. They give you a number and then bring out your food right to your car. It is a little expensive to eat more than once a week but it is well worth it.,0

cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,This is the home of the butter burger and frozen custard. Both are fantastic. And for all you malt fans like me (most places only have shakes) they have some of the best here. This place is consistent; service is very friendly. Is it as good as the ones in Wisconsin? Probably not; but for Arizona; this is a great place for a burger.,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,First of all.... CHEESE CURDS!!!!! AMAZING!   second... my experience. I went through the drive through; where they told me to pull forward because they were making my food fresh. I waited 5-7 minutes as expected. when they brought my food out; they apologized about my wait and gave me a free $5 or $6 ice cream container.   I appreciate the customer service and will return frequently. In tough times; customer service wins business.,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,The food is super good!!! Love the Better Cheddar Burger with bacon and their root beer floats are out of this world!!! The customer service inside or drive thru is always awesome.  Very courteous!!! I was very please when I stopped while I was out Christmas shopping and stopped for a grilled cheese.  I did the basket and then asked for them to add a gift card.  They told me I could get the basket free because I was buying a gift card!!! whoo hoo!!!  LOVE CULVERS!!!!  The prices are reasonable and their concrete mixers are soooo good!!!!!,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,There's something just not right. For those Midwesterners very familiar with Culver's; well; I would rate this sub-par. It's still Culver's nonetheless and their fries are pretty much what I'm used to from back home; but I've been disappointed in the Butter Burger's the 2x I had been here. The taste just seems wrong; the patties over-cooked (maybe left under the heat lamp too long) and they got my order wrong both times. Eeek.,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I died and went to heaven! I have not been able to find Wisconsin Cheese curds anywhere near home. The closest place was Wisconsin! Not anymore! I found my that this place is as good as the original. The food is cooked to order; and is absolutely amazing. I had the butter burger; the way I like it; and couldn't have been happier. They really need to get one out here in Las Vegas. Just saying!,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I love the cheese curds here!!! But that's about it..  I definitely like the country club location better..  This location: -clean and seems organized -burger was flavorless  -my concrete mixer had wayyy too many pumps of syrup - staff was rude; unhelpful;  and not attentive ( I walked up to the counter and the girls continued to joke and laugh with each other and did not even pay attention to my order)  I definitely won't be coming back to this location; even though it is 3 mins away!!,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I grew up with Culvers in the Midwest so I was happy to find this location nearby in Chandler. While I have always had a pretty good experience here customer service wise even during the lunch rush the food has always been only so so. The burgers lately have been really bland which is not the culvers that I remember from back home. The buffalo chicken fingers are really tasty along with the onion rings but lately leaving Culvers I feel unsatisfied. I will give Culvers another shot but I hope the flavor of the burgers improves a bit. So far it's just meh...,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I saw Culver's was offering a Colby Jack Pub Burger and add their delicious crinkle cut fries to the mix and I was sold.  I'm proud to say they did not disappoint.  I ordered a double patty CJPB.  The onion roll was delicious as were the patties but I was a little disappointed in the cheese.  There didn't seem to be a lot of cheese on it but it still tasted very good and I will order it again.  I'll just order extra cheese I guess.  I had my fries which tasted awesome and I saw that the flavor of the day was Mint Oreo so how can I pass up a concrete mixer?  I have yet to have a bad meal at Culver's.  Would I recommend the Colby Jack Pub Burger?  You bet.  Heck; I may have to order the triple patty.,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Their food is pretty darn good!  Everything I have ordered there has been perfectly made so far.  I've stuck to getting the double cheeseburger combo; and Culver's has been consistent so far.    The cheese curds are a perfect side.    People might complain a little about the prices; but I'm pretty sure the prices at Culver's are still cheaper that a place like Carl's Jr.'s.    My daughters love that the kids meals come with frozen custard.  Culver's customer service is at the top of the food chain.  Go there and find out for yourself.    I couldn't find a single reason to deduct a point.,1

cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Great place to go if you want your food fast but don't want to feel like you're sitting in a fast food restaurant. The eating area is clean and much classier than your average booth at Burger King. There are large flat screen TVs with SpongeBob for the kids (or; you know; me) and ESPN for disinterested dads (or in my case; my boyfriend).  The burgers are about as good as you get them at Smashburger - but Culver's is a better value; in my opinion. For about $10 at Smashburger you can get fries; a drink; and a regular sized burger. At Culver's; for about the same price you can get a double burger; fries; and a medium concrete mixer.   So; yes; the burgers are wonderful; and the custard is as heavenly as it sounds. The fries; I'm pretty sure; were brought in from the closest frozen food section. (They didn't taste bad at all; just not like what you would expect at a restaurant.) The service was good; not perfect; but definitely acceptable.   I will definitely be back; but I still need to try Smashburger's Nutter Butter shake...,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I'm from Wisco.... glad to finally see a Culvers in Chandler.  Can't go wrong with a Burger and Cheese Curds.  Very clean and the service is excellent.,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,WHAT.WHAT. The home of the Butter Burger(named so because the bun is buttered). These Burgers are made to order and will Karate chop your taste buds in the best way possible. The cheese curds will judo flip your buds as well. This place is giving my beloved In-N-Out a serious run for it's money. Would be 5 stars but it is a little pricey around $9 for a meal. But the service is superb (they bring your food out to you and will even pick it up for you and throw your trash away). Soleed man Soleed.,1

cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,The service at the Chandler location was so awesome! They really made us feel welcome!,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I SO wanted to like Culver's. After finishing up an evening meeting we walked over to have dinner. We placed our order quickly and then went to fill our drinks. I know it was just after the rush hour but the drink station was a mess. There was liquid all over the place and straw paper wrappers everywhere.   The food was just so-so. I had a sour dough burger. The bread was mushy and the burger tasteless. Did not like the cheese curds at all. My husband had the fish and he said it was average. For what it cost; I'd rather go elsewhere.    One thing I loved; the quotes on the walls were nicely done and inspirational.  Good job here.,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Great service; the food comes out fast and is delicious! They have authentic WI cheese curds and the daily ice cream specials are amazing.,1
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,"Culvers in Casa Grande and Mesa deserve 5 stars but this one in Chandler is barely even 2. I guess I've gotten spoiled with the super friendly service at the other locations and my food always perfect. Today unfortunately I brought friends to this location and it was the WORST experience I have ever had with Culvers. The girls behind the counter and who also deliver the food were unfriendly and almost to the point of rude. The older man was at least a lot friendlier. When one of the girls delivered our food we asked for ranch and mayo for a group of 4 adults and 6 kids; she came back with 2 ranch and 2 mayo's so we asked for more and wow I guess that was the wrong thing to do because she was not happy with that. Well if they had the condiments out where we could get them I would've gladly gotten them myself. And then my friends patty melt bread was burnt (I got the same thing and my bread was not) so I went up to ask for a new burger and the girls all looked at me like \Are you serious??\"" definitely not Culvers friendly not a problem attitude. I didn't even want to go back up to order our deserts they were so unfriendly. Really disappointed with this location!! I am so embarassed that I brought friends to it. They were not impressed. But I LOVE the Casa Grande and Mesa comes in 2nd for service. Their root beer floats are awesome!!""",0

cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,WOW!! I have NEVER received such excellent customer service!! After learning of my not so pleasant experience at his store; Jason the store owner contacted me right away. He was extremely pleasant and apologized. He offered to send me certificates for my next visit but then I got a phone call from him and he had left a basket on my porch filled with goodies and a lot of gift certificates. We live out in San Tan Valley so it's a good 45 minutes from his store. He drove all the way out here to personally deliver the basket. Unfortunately the sign fell off my door bell that it's out of order so I was not able to meet him in person. But I will be going back to this Chandler location for sure. He is an owner who takes customer service to a whole new level and truly appreciates each and everyone of his customers. He did tell me that this is his lively hood so he takes it very seriously. Wow; he definitely does! He has talked to all of his staff and I believe that day was just one of those off days; perhaps even on my part. Thank you Jason for really caring!  I had to edit because I was so shocked by the owner's customer service that I forgot to mention how great the food is. The food is what got me hooked on Culvers to begin with. All the menu items I've tried have been really good but my favorite is the sour dough melt; it has grilled red onions in the burger patty. The root beer float is the best ever!! The custard is delicous and the mint flavor is perfect. A nice surprise is their lemon ice. The ice is shaved like fresh snow and the lemon flavor is perfect. My daughters love it with strawberry topping. A nice healthier alternative to the custard.,1

cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I knew nothing about Culvers until the TV commercials.  Then; I had to give 'em a try. Like the ad says - delicious! Well-prepared food.  Hot; fresh; delicious. Began going through the drive through... OOPS! CONSISTENTLY;CULVERS GETS THE ORDER WRONG on something in the drive through!! I've even called and complained and got coupons for two free baskets on my next visit! To no avail. It seems; even when they are not busy; they cannot get orders right. Now; I know this is not Cordon Bleu food preparation; but c'mon!? Asking for a cheddar butter burger; with lettuce; onion and A-1 sauce ONLY cannot be that difficult. But; it's always wrong.  Either complete with tomato;mayo; etc.  Or minus the requested A-1 sauce! Sigh.  Regardless; the frozen custard is always terrific!  My advice; eat in only.  They bring you the food; and; if it's wrong; fix it.  This place would be damn near perfect if they sold beer! Just don't drive through if you have any special requests!,0
cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,So here's the deal; I'm making this short and sweet because I'm planning a return trip tonight before they close (more on that later).  As for the 5-star rating; it's due to two things; 1) outstanding frozen custard -- the orange creamsicle flavor of the day was outstanding; and we've been enjoying the fudge pecan on a regular basis -- and 2) the customer service is always friendly; and very informative.  As for the return trip; that's due to the discovery that Culver's has veggie patties (apparently there are quite a few vegetarians that work there - FYI the patties are vegetarian; but not vegan); and they allow you to customize your burger as you see fit with various buns.  Anyway; we're headed back for a veggie burger and will let you know what we find. In the interim; give it a try ... apparently there are several Culver's restaurants in the valley but this is the first in our neck of the woods.,1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,We ordered lunch online for pick up and doing so got us in and out in a flash.  Unfortunately;  neither my husband or I was happy with our subs. I ordered a hot Turkey and bacon sub with peppercorn Ranch dressing.  My sub was drowning in the peppercorn Ranch which caused the sub roll to be extremely soggy.  I requested the bacon to be extra crispy but the bacon was so thin and fatty I had to take it off.  My husband got a meatball sub. The meatballs were bland and they put on so much sauce that his sub roll was extremely soggy also.  We will not be eating here again.,0
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,The food here is pretty good. The ingredients seem fresh. I would probably compare them to Quiznos (maybe a little better).  The service is average. The prices are a little higher than normal.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Just an average sub shop.,0
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Had lunch here for the first time a couple of days ago. We will return. Prices are fair and the sandwich was definitely yummy.  The place is spotless and the staff is helpful and friendly.    We each had the veggie sub and I would recommend it to everyone. One tip.  The large sub is huge. Order one large sandwich and split it.  Even a half sandwich is plenty. By yourself?  Order a small sub.  You will not be hungry when you leave.,1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Hot subs; hot sauces; million mix a match Coke machine; and friendly service with a smile and eye contact.  Wow; like this place for sure.  Nice simple menu to keep things going; good choices though; including a hot veggie sandwich.  Located on SE corner of 67th ave. & the 101 next to ACE Hardware.  Can't miss it.,1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Love their specialty subs; ESPECIALLY the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket *drools* its by far my favorite. Also like the New York Steamer (corned beef) and steak and cheese; chicken salad; tuna salad; and turkey; but often times I find myself ordering the smokehouse. The beef isn't like thick slices of brisket; its more like thinly sliced deli meat but they still pack a lot in each sandwich so you're not getting gypped. It's smothered in their delicious bbq sauce and melted cheddar and served hot.   They also do catering as well and we recently ordered from them for a meeting on Midwestern University's campus. After having a less than satisfactory experience with Which Wich's catering; I was a little nervous about ordering from another sandwich place; but Firehouse went above and beyond. The catering package I ordered came with a gallon of iced tea which was forgotten with the initial delivery. I believe it was the manager delivering the order; and he not only went back to bring us the iced tea but also brought some coupon books as a courtesy. The catering order came with all the fixings like 2 different kinds of dressing; condiments; and veggies. Will probably cater from them again; and definitely will be returning for the smokehouse!,1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"Firehouse subs...  If you have not tried it your missing out. \DELICIOUS\""  Food taste great; service is great; prices are great. Awarded Analynn's :)""",1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Loved the subs. Hated the soda machine. 100+ choices; that I can live with. On person using it at a time with a big line while everyone is trying to decide? no; thank you. I just wanted ice for iced tea and still I had to stay in line. I didn't see any other ice machine; so an additional one would be a good idea if they don't have it.  I had the New York sub; on wheat; added mushrooms... delicious. I am not a big fan of subs but I guess I will be back : )  We ordered online so it was ready when we got there.  I didn't know of this place until today; turns out there are a few in the Phoenix area.,0
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"If you like sugar and bread combined then this is your kind of place.    Stopped in for lunch recently with my husband since we were craving a good sub sandwich and was hoping Firehouse would deliver.  In my opinion it failed miserably.   I ordered the \Firehouse Hero Sub\"" which includes smoked turkey breast; Virginia honey ham; roast beef; melted provolone.  Hubby had the \""New York Steamer\"" which includes corned beef brisket; pastrami; melted provolone.     We ordered both subs \""fully involved\"" which includes mayo; mustard; lettuce; tomato; onion; and a dill spear on the side.    When my sub was delivered they forgot the mustard.    The sub looked good but that's where it ended.   The quality of the meats was just terrible.   The Virginia honey ham was so sweet I thought I was going into glucose overload.   That's all I could taste of the sub.  SUGAR!!   Granted a honey ham can be a little on the sweet side but not like this.   Husband's sub had no flavor.   Simply poor quality meats all the way around.   You can get a better sub at Fry's or Basha's using the Boars Head meats.   I would not recommend this place.""",0
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Date of Service: 4/27/2014:  Love this location! I went at lunch time on Sunday to get some subs for take-out. They were so busy (and loud but again; it was packed!) but it's worth the wait! I have food allergies and they were so accommodating and actually got my order correct! Both our subs were delicious and we will be back!  We're from the East Coast where these are all over so it's nice to have a little piece of home out here.,0

Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Awesome Subs!!! Hands down BEST subs - period. The Hot Italian is mouth watering. Generous meat portions like you would make at home. Clean Fireman Theme Restaurant; Fresh Delicious Food; Fast Service; Mega-Selection Coke Machine (Powerade Zero!!!!!). This is the ONLY place to get a sub PERIOD!!,0
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,I ordered the turkey bacon ranch; the #4 but I prefer it without the bacon.  This sandwich was heaven and the mix of ranch turkey and cheddar was just perfect....I took off the bacon but added jalepenio.  This place is hidden near the ACE hardware behind the Paradise Bakery and other business's in this strip mall.  Super clean and casual inside; they have a cool self serve soda machine that has been popping up in upscale fast food places.  You order at the counter and they are very friendly here.  They bring your food to your table and thats it; simple; good; and filling.,1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"Firehouse Subs is one of the best sub places around; in my humble opinion. We miss them from when we lived in South Florida. We found this Firehouse Subs just as good and consistent as back in Florida.  First of all; their meatball subs are like a work of art. It's not often that I have seen such a beautiful; mouth-watering meatball sandwich - I'm not exaggerating about that either.   I came back to Firehouse Subs and got another one the other day and it was like reuniting with that one girl; you know; that one from college you never told your parents about... aww yeah; what memories.  Their other sandwiches; while not being as visually stunning as the meatball; have their appealing idiosyncrasies. Sort of like that other girls from college - all kinds of varieties with their own appeal in one way or another.  Some were \fiery hot\"" while other were more sophisticated and refined.    This is a great place for a sub sandwich!  They food is very tasty; service is fast and friendly and they are conveniently located just south of the 101Hwy on 67th Ave.  I hope to see you there.""",1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Great place!   Clean Good service Fresh rolls Good prices Fast service Great selection  It was busy on a Saturday. Had plenty of people Woking. Line moved fast with three cashiers. Food came out quickly!  Had the Turkey Salsa Verde sub. The sliced Turkey was THE tenderest; moistest turkey I've ever had on a sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious!   Will be back!,1
Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"I had been wanting to check this place out but couldn't get myself in the door even though I live around the corner. Then I found out they have the best birthday deal in town and picked up a free birthday sub. It was full sized; didn't require an additional order; and didn't demand my signature promising my first born to be greeted into the world with a sub and fire hat so I was both shocked and pleasantly surprised. I ordered the hook and ladder because it appeared the one most advertised. It has turkey; ham; and montery jack cheese. The boyfriend stole a bite and liked it as did I. I am personally partial to feeling healthy with a vegged out raw food \healthy tasting\"" fare but for a birthday caloric splurge after a nice run; I am a fan.   Tip: I would order ahead online during rush times; I felt like I waited about 15 minutes for my sub and eyed the people that ordered ahead enviously. I practically pounced on the sandwich when I saw the reciept before the lady even called for it which is why I should be (but sadly am not) too embarrassed to come back.  I should also warn that I raised my star rating to a 4 because it was an awesome birthday deal; I liked the fireman ambience; and I like the cool soda/hotsauce trend. The sandwich itselt was just a little average.""",0
-jBymA8tI-WURtSBcuUdXQ,The front counter girls were great; the manager is not so great under pressure. I went in to pick up a fax order that I could not confirm because they were not answering their phones. 10 orders = 30 minutes give or take even though I faxed it in 20+ minutes prior.  The worst part; I got a LECTURE from the manager (perhaps owner?).    The food wasn't super; the bread isn't what it used to be and I will be sure to visit any other location but this in the future.,1
-jBymA8tI-WURtSBcuUdXQ,I sat in the drive thru waiting for my food for 10 minutes and was not even busy.  slow service. And they gave me the wrong order.,0

-jBymA8tI-WURtSBcuUdXQ,"I had a VERY friendly young man wait on us Tuesday the 9th of April.  But our sandwiches were like ALL BREAD??!!!; and the kid agreed.  I ordered a 3rd for my wife and I with extra meat and the damn thing had hardly any meat; I mean what an insult to your intelligence.  Our bill - are you ready for this? - was $29 for 3 sandwiches and a garbage red beans and rice soup and 1 water and 1 pop.  The meat on their sandwiches could fit in your mouth in one bite.  This is not a jab at the VERY friendly employees; they were so kind and accommodating to us (and noted the 2 of 2 high chairs had non-functioning belt buckles.)  But the sandwiches were absolute insults to you; to your pocketbook.  The sauce bottles on tables were filthy.  If some other outfit would go and steal these nice employees they'd do well.  The meat portion on a sandwich would be ideal for a 2 day old sparrow in a nest that didn't like regurgitated worms; the standard meat portion would keep the 2 day old sparrow satisfied for nearly half an hour.  If we bought just $10 of lunch meat at the grocery store it would be unreal how much we'd get.  This place is a \must-miss.\""  A MUST-MISS.""",1
-jBymA8tI-WURtSBcuUdXQ,First time here. 11:30 on a Tuesday morning and it's only 1/4 full. Where is everyone? Sat by the drive thru window and that line was busy and crawling. Too bad. Maybe that's where everyone is? Ordered the Angus beef and cheese on jalapeño cheddar bread. It arrived in 7 mins. Bread was fresh (toasted); produce crisp and the meat was heated-all good. Not as much meat as; say; Port of Subs. Tasted good tho. Good table side hot sauce. Gave it a nice kick. Good touch guys.  I recommend the beef and cheese sandwich. It was tasty and filling.,0
-jBymA8tI-WURtSBcuUdXQ,Small Santa Fe  for me; a Chicken Cordon Bleu for my son; and we're sharing a Mini Pecanbon.  Service was kinda slow for 230 pm but I noticed business picked up significantly in the drive thru about 15 minutes later.   I got some strange piece of something in my sandwich and the manager on duty sorta explained what it was and offered to make me a fresh sandwich.  I declined the remake and told her it was alright but wanted to let them know.  She was more than willing to make it right.  :-) The Cinnabon just aren't nearly as good as they were when they had them in Fiesta Mall; Smitty's (even their day old); or Chandler Mall.  Dough doesn't seem cooked thoroughly and even on the Minions you get an almost mushy center.  :-(  I suppose it's just as well cuz i don't need to be eating anymore of that stuff.   I like Schlotzskys; but so glad it isn't so close to home because I know I would get burned out on this stuff.,0
-jBymA8tI-WURtSBcuUdXQ,Had the large Angus beef and cheese; was pleasantly shocked at the size of it; I've got a big appetite and it was filling for even me.  Outstanding customer service; mind numbing sandwich. Will definitely be back again.,1
-jBymA8tI-WURtSBcuUdXQ,The Angus sandwich was really good. Fresh; hot and made to order. The front counter woman was pleasant; so was the manager. I look forward to going back soon.,1
j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,"I'm a fan of Chick-fl-a.  They're good (better than McDonalds); cheap; and friendly.  Be sure to tell them 'thank you' at the end of an order.  I'm willing to bet they'll answer with a friendly; \My pleasure\"".  (Try to see what happens at the McDonalds up the street if you try this!)  If you dine inside at this location; they have an enclosed play area for the kids.    If you come for lunch at this location come before 11:00am or after 1:00pm -- ESPECIALLY if you plan on using the drive through.  They have quite a congestion problem in the drive-through at lunch.""",1

j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,"What's not to love about Chick-Fil-A? The original chicken sandwich and waffle fries is the best combo and compared to other fast food options; its not terribly horrible for you.  But;if you are really trying to be good; the grilled chicken sandwich is good.  You can ask for no butter on the bun and order a side salad. If you really want to be bad; they have yummy brownies and ice cream.    Also; the people who work at Chick Fil A are so nice and friendly!  They always say; \my pleasure\"" instead of \""your welcome.\"" See for yourself!  They will refill your drink and clear your table and ask you you're doing.  Its like fast food with sit down style courtesy.  We all complain that Chick Fil A is closed on Sundays; but I like it because it makes the other 6 days  that you can go to Chick Fil A even more special!  Haha!""",0
j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,My doctor says I need more fiber in my diet; she says it's nature's broom.  I say my diet is just fine; relying on the more traditional staples; such as pink snowballs; fritos; and beer. I tell her it's not not exactly nature's broom; but it is janitorial in a sense; almost like a mop and bucket.   But the 'roids need to go or else there'll be an operation she says...one nvolving hot pokers and way too much probing for my liking. This is where CFA comes in handy.  They have a cole-slaw that's to die for; one guaranteed to promote a healthy colon; or at best; keep my proctologist's hands (and hot intruments) away from my precious bum; which has yet to break it's maiden with a hot poker or inquisitive finger.  So if you like cole slaw; and your doctor orders you to eat fiber; this is the answer to your... prayers? You'll be crapping like a sick barnyard animal in no time.  Go CFA cole slaw!!!

j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,Every time I think about going to Chick-fil-a it's on Sunday; when they're closed.  Luckily; I remembered during a weekday and stopped by this location to grab a quick bite.

j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,Had the cool wrap.  Tasted good for fast food.  While I was eating; I looked up the ingredients and nutrition.  Whatever happened to just plain food?  There are so many additives in the wrap.  Because of this; I would come back very seldom. Unfortunately; this chain purports to be healthy food.  I encourage anyone who eats here to check the ingredients in their choices before ordering.,0
j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,Here is my gripe. The food is good. No complaints there. It's the employees. While standing at the register and ordering; there were three girls behind the counter that kept staring at my wife; whispering; and rolling their eyes. They were literally looking her up and down. I had sunglasses on so they could not see that I was watching them; and actually my wife didn't notice it because she was busy ordering for our kids. After we went and sat down; I continued to watch them; and from a distance I not only observed the girls gawking at various femaie customers; but two of the male employees were also gawking at various girls and nudging and elbowing each other and staring. I have noticed this going at a two other restaurants; Rubios just up the street; and Port O Subs at Desert Ridge. And it's not like I'm looking for this; I just have a habit of noticing details in my surroundings. I would like to know if I am the only person in the world that notices things like this; because this behavior seems to be very common and management knows nothing (or does nothing) about it.,0
j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,The worst customer service.   Very unorganized at the cash register.   Waited over 15 minutes for food.  The employees socialize with customers rather than provide service.  Never coming here again when I can drive up the road and be served the correct way.,0

j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,"Let me start by saying that I don't go to fast food restaurants. Like; at all. This is purely the effect of my current San Francisco metropolitan lifestyle; as cliche as that may be.  However; a few coworkers insisted that I at least try this fine establishment. So to cross an item off my fast-food bucket list; I caved. (Still haven't been to Wendy's and Jack-in-the-Box; fingers crossed...).  The food was exactly as you'd expect; a giant menu of chicken--fried and grilled and every way you can imagine. That is a positive thing though; because I'm usually underwhelmed by the quality of fast food when compared to their own pictures on the menu.  Brownie points for the great service (I'm told they have to say \my pleasure\"" when thanked for their service) and the fact that they use all-breast meat and peanut oil to make their nuggety deliciousness.  Chick-Fil-A might just be one of the few fast food restaurants that deserve a 4+ rating.  -----  Distinguishing factor: A genuine fast food joint that is truer to their image than their counterparts.""",1
j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,I made a catering phone order last week and was highly disappointed. I purchased 2 trays of the mini sandwiches. When I picked them up; I was told that they are best eaten fresh and that the bread would get hard if they are left out. Considering I had 2.5 hours until my event; I asked how to best preserve them. They said I would be unable to and not eating them right away could result in them getting stale. Basically; I ended up giving the trays to friends while they were still hot and not using them for my event. $65 bucks down the tubes. You think they could have mentioned that to me at the time of my phone order.,0
j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,Horrendous! Having been in Arizona for 7-months I thought it was time to try Chick fil A. I ordered the Charbroiled Chicken sandwich and Chick fil A Waffle Fries. The order took about 2-minutes to arrive - which concerned me immediately because I ordered my sandwich without lettuce. I got to my table; opened the sandwich box and as soon as I touched the bun I could feel the moisture of it being in a microwave. I lifted the bun to expose 2 hideous looking slices of tomato; and a sickly looking piece of chicken. Okay; I'm at a fast food restaurant; and I'm not expecting a gourmet meal. I bite into the sandwich and it has all the taste of a piece of chicken that was made last night and then tossed into the microwave the next day. I took 3 bites and I was done. Moving to those things they call waffle fries... no taste whatsoever. Ate about 7 of them. My entire dining experience took less than 9-minutes inside Chick fil A and I will NEVER EVER try it again. I should have throw $7 in the trash.,0
j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,"Had to find that \fast food\"" meal and this was a perfect choice for this Cali fam to try.  My kids said this is \""real\"" chicken sandwiches.

78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,Excellent service and the food is very good.  Good value with quality ingredients.,1
78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,Tasty; fast lunch option. The staff at this location are always extremely friendly even if the line is out the door. I do suggest you get here before 11:30am or after 1:00pm to avoid the crowds. I always get the turkey and provolone on wheat Mike's way (without tomatoes).  They slice their meats fresh and they are generous with the toppings; but sometime add too much oil...so keep that in mind.  I think Jersey Mike's has become my favorite fast sub sandwich chain. They may be a bit more pricey but they beat the snot out of Subway and Jimmy Johns when it comes to service and taste.  Happy Lunching!,1
78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,I consider Jersey Mike's one of the premium sub shops. They are on the higher end of the price scale but their quality is the reason for that. Their fixins and bread are always very fresh and they slice the meats & cheeses to order. The employees are always friendly and chatty. They have a loyalty card that lets you earn free sandwiches. They have a few TV's that always have the games on. Because of the pricing; I don't go here more than once a week because I can probably save $3 at Subway with a daily special. It is a treat that I usually reserve for the weekend but we look forward to it because we like their sandwiches. If I did not get the daily specials at Subway then this would be my workweek place too.,1
78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,I just love the Italian subs here.  They are fresh and delicious.  If you ask for a little special attention (extra oil or spices); you get exactly what you asked for.  The service is fine and friendly.  Orders are ready quickly.  The prices are fair.  The place is clean and bright.  What could be better?  Nothing.  This is a great local sub shop.,1

78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,"Worst customer service ever. The younger dark girl who made our sandwiches (I think she said her name was shawny or something) was super friendly and smiley and nice. I ordered a sandwich and asked for double meat; expecting it to cost anywhere between $1-3 (I used to work at subway). She told me it would cost extra; I said it's fine. Then the manager rang me up and it was $15!! I was shocked; she asked if I wanted my receipt and I said yes; and I noticed she charged me twice for double meat which alone totaled to $5. When I confronted her about it she denied it and then said they have an \extra meat\"" option AND a \""double meat\"" option; WHO KNEW?! Not only did they not mention it to me or inform me; ITS NOT EVEN WRITTEN ANYWHERE ON THEIR DAMN MENU. The manager was such a fucking bitch; didn't even offer to give me my money back; let alone APOLOGIZE?! Nothing at all. I told her they need to explain that to customers because we don't have any way of knowing and she just gave me this rude sarcastic ass smile and said OKAY! Fucking ridiculous; I feel bad for the poor sweet girl that has to deal with that thing managing her. Never going back to this location again.  Ps - I also noticed ants all over the floor when I was done eating my sandwich""",1

78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,This location has all of the usual elements: the service is great; the ingredients are very fresh; and the offerings are simple and tasty.  Jersey Mike's bread is my favorite sandwich bread in town (must be the result of my Philly roots).  Getting it Mike's Way really makes for a great sandwich; too:  it's a fantastic combination of lettuce; tomato; onion; red wine vingear (the more; the better!); olive oil (I prefer just a splash); oregano and salt!   My husband and I usually split a Giant Veggie sandwich; which comes for two kinds of cheese and green peppers.  It's a pretty good deal (not priced like Subway; but doesn't taste like Subway; either).,1
78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,"Jersey's Mike's makes a good premium sandwich that for the most part is better then the rest.  A few nights ago; I found myself at Capriotti's waiting over twenty minutes for my sandwich to be made right.  You can read that review; but it made me think about all the different Cheese Steaks sandwiches in the area.    There are no Geno's or Pat's nearby that could take their crown; but I've always found Jersey Mike's and Corleone's on Northsight have done a better job then most.  And; I really don't mean that as a back handed complement.  This afternoon; I stopped by and ordered a 8\ Big Kahuna Cheese Steak to see if my memory and/or my stomach was playing tricks on me.  And; for the most part; I would say that Jersey Mike's does a great job.  I paid $7.25 for the sandwich; and another $2.19 for chips and a drink.  The total came to $10.32; which is a full dollar cheaper then Capriotti's; and there I didn't get chips for my $11.53.    Now; granted their sub was 12\"" to Jersey Mike's 8\""; but Mike's was just as good!  Though admittedly I have a weakness for Capriotti's bread with their corn meal bottoms.  Not being from Philly and not wanting to tread on somebody else turf (and Cheese Whiz aside); but I'm going to give Jersey Mike's Four Stars to Capriotti's Three and half Stars.  Enjoy!  ***Don't forget to ask for the \""stamp card\""; so you can record your visit ***""",0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I decided to try Pei Wei after having not eaten there for a couple years since their menu never seemed very healthy.  They recently changed some of their options so I ordered a few takeout dishes for my family; all steamed chicken or shrimp. They tasted ok; but what really spoiled the experience was my wife's Chinese chopped chicken salad. About 3/4 through the meal she stopped eating; disgusted by the insect among her salad which was still ALIVE.  I contacted the manager (Cory or Cody; I believe) and he only offered a quick apology and to make us a different dish if we drove back to the restaurant. I told him we were too far away and he should check the rest of their salad for similar insects (see the pictures I included with this review). He didn't seem too concerned. Furthermore; my voicemail messages to Pei Wei corporate customer relations have not been returned. This Pei Wei location is definitely a lower tier; fast food version of PF Chang's.  I'd avoid it and go to Panda Express nearby instead. At least there you can see what goes on your plate before you eat it.,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,This was my first visit to this location that just opened up. Upon walking in; you can tell this restaurant is new as it is oh so clean. The decor is awesome and the atmosphere is great! Above the registers the menu is projected on large; easy to read screens.   As for the food; I ordered the broccoli & ginger tofu w/ brown rice. I couldn't believe how delicious it was. It was the perfect sized portion and left me satisfied. Bravo to the chefs at this location!   The place was immaculate!,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Great prices for the food. Love the online ordering,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I've only been here once so my review is probably not worth much but I thought the food was really salty. That's probably why I haven't been back since.   The restaurant is nice though; service is good; and easy to find.,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I visited Pei Wei for the first time last Sunday.  We told the cashier it was our first time visiting and she was very helpful. I loved the fountain drink machine.  The carbonation was good and they have pretty much any kind of soda you could want; including some I didn't even know existed. I ordered a combo plate which was a smaller portion and included a starter.  I went with the Hot and Sour soup which is normally a favorite of mine; and we started with some Crab Wontons. The flavor of the soup was good; but the consistency was much too thick for my palette; almost like a gravy vs a soup.  I would not order it again. The crab wontons were good; had a lot of crab flavor and were presented sitting in a chili type of sweet and sour sauce.  I enjoyed them but some people might now like the wontons swimming in that sauce. My mongolian beef was delicious; and my boyfriend ordered a thai coconut chicken which also had a great flavor.   With the exception of the soup; all the rest of our food was fresh and very flavorful.  I also felt that the value for the money was superb.  I will definitely be going back there.,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,"I didn't think I could be so turned off from a place I was so looking forward to.  Let me first say I'm a fan of Pei Wei but not this location.  The newness of this location has me expecting some serious wait times and I am okay with that.  What I am NOT okay with is the girl taking my order who is so wonderfully adorned with hickies the size of silver dollars all of her neck and also the attitude that I am bothering her by having her take my order AKA her JOB! Apparently there was a 45 minute \to go\"" wait that she decided to not tell me about when ordering (the restaurant itself was relatively empty so I would not have come upon this conclusion otherwise).  When I asked after 20 minutes of waiting where my food was; I was laughed at and told my someone who just got done blowing their nose and NOT washing their hands that it would be another 20-25 minutes. Appalled and disgusted.  This location and Pei Wei in general might lose my years of business because of poor management.  Don't waste your time.""",0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I haven't been to Pei Wei in a couple years and it sounded good. We came during the lunch rush and it was crazy!  After 20 minutes in line we were able to order our food. The woman behind the counter could hardly hear us. I felt like I was screaming my order at her. After placing our order we found a place to sit down. With how busy it was the tables were being cleared very fast which was nice.  The food took quite awhile to come out and after standing in line for so long I was about to eat the silverware and napkins sitting in front of me.   If you want to have a conversation during your meal I suggest you bring an old fashioned ear trumpet horn so your companion can shout into one end and you can listen on the other end. It was LOUD in there.   I ordered the Mongolian Steak with brown rice. I really liked the brown rice. The meat was a little chewy and heavy on the sauce.   Overall I would like to try more items off their menu; however I think I will call ahead and pick up.,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Been to two of their locations ........ The closed Fountain Hills ...... Which was terrible.                   AND This One ........ Which Thus Far Is .........TERIFFIC  The staff at the ordering counter were competent and loudly repeated back your order to avoid errors.  The food quality ....... was outstanding. The Taste .......... of our chicken dish was Delicious. The Other Entree .......... was a Steak dish which was also Enjoyed.,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,We go to the Grayhawk location every week and they do a better job cooking and have better customer service! We had to visit this location for convenience and we're extremely disappointed in the way our food tasted. Not sure why there is a huge discrepancy in the taste between the two locations but I'll drive an extra 15 minutes for better tasting food! Also; sat down on the bench with my toddler and the cushion was sliding out to the point where we would fall out of our seats! When I mentioned it to the bus girl she said it's because they use it as storage and someone probably hadn't closed it correctly! Um OK. Lol,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,The food was good. Excellent egg rolls; wonderful hot and sour soup; good pad Thai. However; service was slow and the noise level was harsh. We would get take out from her but would not come back to eat here.,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I love the chicken fried rice here.  I always get a kick out of the soda machine; every flavor you've ever imagine and who doesn't like to try your luck at a fortune cookie again and again.  Great food at good prices. Fast services.,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,"Not impressed.  Rude woman taking my to go order. I say \hi there - I'd like -\"" and I am interrupted with an abrupt \""for here or to go?\"" No hello; no thank you; no come again. No personality. Just fired questions at me. This was not a busy time; for the record.  Filthy floors. Food; trash and napkins all over.  Egg roll was so amazingly greasy I took a photo and dumped it in the trash. I have never seen anything that weighted down with oil. It actually broke in half.  Low mein was unremarkable. Sort of bland and extremely light on the chicken. Maybe 4 or 5 small pieces.  I'll give this place one more try because previously I had a coworker pick up pad Thai for me it was quite tasty; but they need to step a lot of things up a notch here. Hope they pull it together.   And how hard is it to be pleasant to your customers? Sheesh!""",0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,"Except for the awkward and somewhat confusing \Order upon entry\"" setup they have; very impressed with the food quality / taste and beverage selection... A tad noisy due to the open layout; but nothing to prevent me from returning for another round of Asian deliciousness!""",0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Unlike other reviewers; I always had a great meal and experience at the Fountain Hills location.  However; this location is TERRIBLE!!  The ordering set up stinks; people try to cut in front of you and the staff doesn't care.  Our food all came out at different times.  The Server had a very uncaring attitude.  The rice wasn't cooked all the way.  I was not happy and thinking twice about ever coming back.,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Being owned by PF Chang's; I was really expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered the Spicy Korean Chicken; a cup of Hot and Sour Soup; and a drink. While the food was cooked perfectly there really was no flavor at all. The soup tasted like a beef broth made with buillion cubes without a single hint of sour or spice. The Spicy Korean Chicken was moist; but unless your idea of spicy is black pepper your out of luck. Yes; I know you can add some spice after the fact but when you order something spicy you expect SOME form of heat. Overall; it was not worth my $12 for lunch. I will give it another shot as I know this may have been a one off; but right now I'd rather eat at Panda Express.,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,"Who needs to \yelp\"" Pei Wei; right?  Right.  However; this review is about this particular location.

9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Wait was far too long. After about 25 minutes they brought out the food; not only was it cold and undercooked but it was the wrong order. Won't be going back.,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend; and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals; especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,We've been here a few times for an early lunch or an early dinner before heading to a movie. Decent location for the chain with the typical offerings. The parking lot here can be a little tricky with it being inside of a fairly busy complex - so I recommend coming here at off times instead of trying to be a part of the lunch rush.   The staff is always friendly and the food comes out hot and as ordered each time. They seem to be able to keep up with the rushes by keeping the tables clean and ready for the next guest; which is always nice. A fair number of people seem to get to-go from here; which may be due to all of the local businesses in the area and people wanting to take their meals back to the office; which means that there are almost always seats available in the main area; despite the number of cars outside.    Definitely a place we'll hit up again for a quick bite.,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I'm pretty sure this pei wei was built for the good employees of Vanguard.  Went here for a quick lunch with sister; the place was busy which was nice. The only thing that wasn't nice was how incredibly loud it was inside. I could barely hear my sister talking from across the table; but I could definitely hear all the financial complaints from fellow financial service employees.  The food left a bit to be desired. O ordered my usual orange peel chicken; but what I ended up with was something along the lines of orange peel and vegetables. Maybe 4 pieces of chicken. Really?  The service was quick; but not friendly. The drink station was a mess. Probably won't be re visiting.,1

9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,"This evening my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some takeout on our way home from Christmas shopping. We walked in the takeout door into a chaotic mess. After 10 minutes of waiting in \line;\"" we were finally greeted at the register. I say \""line\"" because it was really more of a cluster of customers being randomly waited on by one of four confused Pei Wei employees.  While attempting to place our order; I repeated \""chicken\"" about four times because the young man questioned what kind of protein I wanted in my \""kung pao chicken.\"" Um; chicken in my kung pao chicken please. When my boyfriend attempted to order his spicy Korean steak; the young man spaced out and could not comprehend \""steak.\"" \""Steak? What do you mean; steak?\"" A young woman walked over and scolded; er; showed him how to enter the entree. \""He wants steak!\"" Young man: \""He didn't specify that!\"" Young woman to my boyfriend: \""It helps if you order backwards from the order of the menu.\"" After the awkwardness settled; the two employees then parted ways from the register and left us unable to complete our order. They both continued to wait on other patrons in the \""line\"" and completely ignored my question of \""Um; can we complete our order?\"" We stood there as I glared at any employee who even slightly made eye contact. Still nothing. We left. The restaurant business is too competitive for this location to operate in such a terrible way.""",0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,This particular location is pretty busy most of the time.  It is located within a shopping complex that in itself is busy regularly as well.  We stopped here for dinner before seeing a movie in the area; and although there was a line; it moved pretty quickly.  I had the Mongolian Beef - which is my typical order when we come here.  We also tried out the pot stickers; which were not as good as the ones at PF Changs.  Probably wouldn't order those again; but the spring rolls are a good substitute. The beef was cooked well and we enjoyed the extra sauce the server brought over to us.  Overall: B+ Busy location; but with friendly staff and pretty quick food service it's not a bad stop off.,1

9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,"When I moved to Phoenix; Pei Wei was one of the first restaurants I went to and one of my go to places for Asian food. However; over the past 7 years; I have found other places I enjoy and would rather dine at. The food is standard and tastes good; but it isn't fantastic. I like that they are doing lunch specials now; so that helps since the portions can be exceedingly large and not great the next day. This location opened up close to work; so it's easily accessible; which is a plus. We came here a few weeks after the grand opening; but it seemed that all the kinks weren't worked out. While waiting in line; there was only one gal on the register and she was ignoring us in favor of folks who just walked in for Take Away. Finally; a Take Away Customer said to her \Aren't you going to help them? They were here first.\"" She glanced at us; then back to the customer and shook her head no before sighing and finally asking us for our order. Not sure what that was about; but I think they need more employees on the registers; especially at lunch time.""",0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I get take out from here 2-3 times a month and it's always right. I've never had a problem.   Today was the first time I placed the order in store; usually it's done online. I expected a horrible wait but I was in and out in 10 min with my lunch.    Awesome food and awesome service!,1

9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Pei Wei is not your typical Chinese restaurant; in fact; they view and market themselves as a Asian Bistro.  So depending on your tastes; you will either enjoy their version of your favorite dish; or not.  We came here last night and ordered a bunch of our favorite dishes and left feeling that there was a new choice in the Northsight corridor.   The area; for those not familiar with the Raintree exit from 101; is a mixture of Kohls; Walmart; Costco; Whole Food; et cetera; along with some quick food options like NYPD; Paradise Bakery; Al's Beef; Luke's; Asian Island and more.  We came around five-forty or so; and found the seating area full; but with some openings.  Two couples were ahead of us in line; but they had three cashier stations taking orders; so our wait was short.  The three of us ordered; a bowl of the Hot & Sour soup for $4.95; six Pork Egg Rolls for $7.25 to share; a Spicy Korean (Chicken) with noodles for $8.25; Mongolian Chicken with rice for $8.25 and a soft drink for $1.85.  The damage came to $30.55; plus tax.  Now; I've eaten Asian food all over the world and I've never had a Spicy Korean (see photo) before last night. I know my Korean friends and relations would not recognize it as Korean. There is no Bulgogie or Kimchi served at Pei Wei; though the noodles might remind you of Kalgooksoo.  But; the dish was good.  Four star good; as the review indicates.  The Mongolian dish (see photo) is similar to the Garlic and Scallions dish you would find in most Szechuan restaurants.  It's as good as any we've had before.   The Hot and Sour soup is also a winner and is easily recognizable. What  does  Pei Wei not serve?  Well; General Tao's chicken; pan fried dumplings; the afore mentioned Korean dishes; dim sun; and Pho of any kind.  I could go on.  The food is good; if you look past the name and accept the general Asian-ness of what is being offered.   One shout-out to Adrian; who acted as the dinning room Server/Clearer. He was great and very responsive in getting additional items for us!  Enjoy!,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Love the fried rice and broccoli beef. Pretty fast service as well. However their wifi connection sucks. Hope they can fix it soon.,1
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,First time here.  They have light choices & you can customize your dish!  Lots of spicy sauce  & protein choices!  Something for everyone in your group!  I ordered steamed veggies with tofu and brown rice and it was not only delicious but healthy too!  The veggies were cooked just right; still crunchy and yet soft enough???  The broccoli sauce that accompanied the veggies had some broccoli stalks and light and not too salty; slight thickened and browned with soy sauce.  For what I paid; around $8.00; I had a nice hearty healthy meal and I could eat only half of it so I will eat it again tomorrow for lunch!,0
9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Wide variety of Asian styles.  Service experience at this location varies widely during lunch.  Food is consistent.  Patio great during day; impossible at dusk.,0
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,Ordered your basic bean; cheese; sofritas burrito. the guy rolled it into a ball. I said hey your making my burrito a ball. He said; no I am not. Anyways; I had them put NO salsa on my burrito cause the beans did not look HOT I was right. cheese never melted. barely put any sofritas on either.,0
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,Absolutely love this location! My husband and I order a couple times a month and they never disappoint. When it's busy; the line goes quickly and the people are nice. A little smaller than other Chipotle locations but still a good one :),1
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,I usually don't review large national chains but I'm making an exception here because I hope they can take it as constructive criticism.   I'm a big fan of Chipotle. I eat there for lunch a few times a month and I always get the same thing - a carnitas burrito bowl. I've been to this location a couple times now hoping that it will get better but it just doesn't. Here's why: 1. The wait. most Chipotle's are busy. But most of them know how to move the line fast. Not this one. On my first visit a woman complained because it took so long to get from the meat to the salsa because they were so busy fixing a large messed up order that her meat would be cold. On my most recent visit I stood in line for over 15 minutes and the line wasn't out the door. It was the longest I've ever been in line at a Chipotle. 2. The food. I know chain restaurants have a certain way of doing things but I don't think the people working here were trained properly because the food is always overdone or they are scraping the bottom of the containers and I get scraps. On my last visit the rice was super overcooked and the carnitas were overshredded little bits of meat. It was not good. 3. The food line. It's a mess. Every time I've gone in there is food everywhere. Not clean at all and pretty unappetizing. Ick.  C'mon guys; I know you can do better than this! But until you do; I'll be going to the other Chipotle down the road.,0
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,Carnitas salad bowl with black beans; mild salsa; cheese; and guacamole is my favorite!!!  I am usually in during the evening and have had consistently good service! They are willing to answer questions and handle special requests.,1
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,Fast. The guys Who took my order today where exceptionally nice!!! Parking lots can be a tad bit overwhelming through,1
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,everytime I have gone here the staff has messed up our orders. One day it was so bad I called and the manager offered us a completely free order; which was awesome. She totally followed through on that thus the 2nd star; but that order was also screwed up. Nice people but that doesn't cut it when people pay you for food. Might need some re-training here,0
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,Fast and friendly service; very tasty options. I had a barbacoa bowl with brown rice; black beans; veggies; corn and hot salsa. Terrific.  Girlfriend had the sofritas (tofu) which she said was good as well.  I love their tacos too. I wish they would sell queso though.,1
PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,I've been a Chipotle fan for years and have had consistent positive experiences at their restaurants.  Unfortunately; when I went to the new Chipotle at the Scottsdale Pavilions today for lunch I was very disappointed by the terrible quality of my order.  I ordered online from my office (as I usually do to avoid the lunch line).  The restaurant itself is very nice - smaller than most Chipotles; but the decor is very modern and pleasant.    I always order crunchy chicken tacos and the quality and consistency has generally been very good; however; that was not the case today.  The chicken was all dark meat instead of breast meat; and was greasy and gristly.  My crunchy taco shells were soaked and soggy with grease by the time I got back to my office (less than 5 minutes).  I managed to stomach a few bites; but I threw the rest away.    If this is Chipotle's attempt to increase profits by marginalizing quality; they've lost me as a customer permanently.  Charge me an extra $1 and keep the quality.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,First experience at Portillo's was at the one in Chicago. When I found out there was one in Scottsdales; I was excited! Went out there for GIANTS spring training and had to make a stop at this place. It was just as delicious as I remember!  My go to milkshake flavor is chocolate but bf ordered the strawberry and it was YUM-MAY!,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I love Portillo's; and I'm a big fan of their Beef sandwich and salads; I stop by during the first week they opened and the line was not bad. It was nice to see all the folks from the Naperville; IL location that I had not seen in about 3 years. The food was great! It was everything I remembered from the good and the bad!   The Good:   Food taste was the same; the Beef has great flavor that I have yet to taste when eating other Beef sandwiches from around the US.   The Bad:  My order was incorrect; funny thing is I'm use to it from the Naperville location so it was funny that this location made the same error. But overall the food is great and the experience for me is the same which is great and I'm glad they are in town!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Good so far; need to work out the pick up your order section.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I saw a line out the door when I was on my way home from work the other day; so I figured it must be a great place.  I checked out the menu online and decided I wanted to take my parents over there to try it.   Now my dad loves Italian beef sandwiches; so i usually take him to Luke's across the freeway.  So sorry to Luke's for trying something new.  We got there about 11:30 am; just right before the lunch rush but looks like that started pretty early.  The outdoor patio was full with customers and the line inside was pretty long.  Now let me tell you that I've never seen so many people working in a restaurant before but it was definitely needed!   The first thing you have to do is get in line to order your food.  Keep in mind that if you want salads; you would need to go to two different areas to pick up your food.  But like I said; there are lots or people working that its pretty quick for the order coming out.  Finding a table was no that big of a problem; so I had the Asian chicken salad and my dad had the Italian beef.  My mom and nephew had the Chicago style hot dogs.  The salad was very good and a good portion and i took a bite of the Italian beef and it was awesome.  You have a choice of having your Italian beef sandwich dipped in Au jous to make the meal more juicy which is what i recommend.   The place is very good but is you want to avoid the lunch crowd; come after 12:30pm; that's when the crowds kinda lighten up.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Decided to give it another go today and see if my first impression was right.  I ordered the Italian beef and onion rings.  The beef was soaked in olive oil and not that good.  The onion rings are frozen but still good.  I have absolutely no desire to go back ever.  If i want a hot dog; I'll go to Ted's in Tempe and if I want a beef I'll go to Rosati's at Warner and McClintock since it's not a franchise.  I had a friend from Chicago with me and he even said that the beef's were different from the ones back home.  Way too much olive oil put on the beef if you ask for hot peppers.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Although I'm no Chicago native; I've been there and can say that this place doesn't do Chicago dogs justice. We ordered the jumbo chili cheese dog; Italian beef; fries; and a burger. Everything just tasted okay. The Italian beef was the one item that was pretty decent.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Being from Chicago I was waiting for this place to open!  Still love it!  Gotta get the italian beef with lots and lots of hot peppers!  They have yummy crinkle fries if I remember correctly.  I also order some gravy on the side. (basically its au jus the beef is cooked in).  So delicious!  Now that they have been open a while its not as packed as when it first opened.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I have been to Portillos twice now; and the service and food are incredible.  The prices are pretty good too.  I can't wait for the Tempe location to open.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Ok so maybe I dont get why they had 4 attendants ( people) threw the drive threw area one asking order; even when they had a drive up menu / with speaker box  and there where 2 of those; one handling money -- even this freaks me out a bit espic hoping the right change is handled properly; and 4 was at drive threw window. TO me that seems like a wasted staff amount probably could be used inside rather then outside. Took about 7 mins for order big meat - Italian Beef sand. The meat and auju was great bread was lacking it. The onion rings could tell they where fresh however a little bland we where in drive threw and not presented our drink while waiting for our food. I dont mind waiting espic if I have a drink to chill out too but to me that was interesting. I do not understand concept of having to stop and talk to people I would rather pull too the menu board and order that way. If there triing to be like sonic ? It was a friday however I still do not understand why so many steps and still left a little confused. I rather run into chompies.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This is the ONLY fast food place I will go. I always get my order char grilled which takes an extra few minutes but so worth the wait. Their hot dogs are the perfect size with just the right amount of onions; relish; tomatoes and peppers for a nice kick. I know they offer a jumbo dog if you are very hungry but the regular dog will leave you without the feeling of total regret. The service and staff members are very sweet and know how to do their job.,1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Stopped by for lunch and had a beef and Italian sausage combo while my wife had the beef and cheddar croissant.  The service was fast and friendly and the dining area is clean and bright.  The sausage and peppers made up for the bland beef in my soggy sandwich; while my wife's croissant was nothing special. The fries were just OK.  I may try a dog if I am nearby during lunch again; but will pass on the beef.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Pretty great food. It's really just popular for being the chain it is. It's a little chaotic and always full; but it's a great experience. I've tried quite a few of the items and been here multiple times; so here are my reviews for them. Chili cheese hotdog: Great! Chock full of cheese; chili; and onions. The hotdogs are great quality and the buns are soft; and delicious. Make sure to get the jumbo size! Definitley a lot bigger; but not too much more expensive.  Regular Hotdog: Just okay. I guess I'm not fans of any chicago dogs; but on the bright side; the thing was very full!  Italian Beef: MMMM!! What can I even say? The first bite was a little weird; but as I kept eating; it got more and more amazing!! The beef is perfectly cooked; and almost buttery tasting; and has a little kick of heat. THe flavor is seriously amazing; and bread compliments it perfectly. And for those who complain it's soggy; it's dipped in the juices! If you don't like it; ask for it \Dry\""   Cheese Fries: The fries are quite generic; but they're cooked perfectly crispy; and the inside is very soft. The cheese; as always; is great.  Burgers: They're pretty great. But why would you order a burger at Portillos? Good; but not recommended unless you're not a fan of anything else here.  Chopped Salad: Pretty good. But still; not worth it.  It has a very unique flavor and a nice sweet tang. Probably not worth getting again.  Chocolate cake shake: Just okay; great for chocolate lovers; but too sweet in my taste.  Overall; if you're a hotdog fan and looking for a great hotdog in the valley; this is defintley recommended. I also recommend the italian beef. One thing about this place is that it can add up to be a bit pricey if you order a few things.""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,There are few chains I will review normally but this place was great so I felt I owed it to the staff to give them a good review.  I have never heard of this place before; but my bosses have and they wanted a catered lunch from here. They had an idea of the menu before hand so I trusted their judgement.  They were great over the phone answering questions and being patient...I had a lot. They sent email confirmation and were all around awesome. The day to pick up arrived and they had everything ready to go...no waiting around.  That's when I realized I locked my keys in the car with my cell phone...awesome. Not only were the people behind the togo counter awesome; they were just plain out patient and willing to help...and able to laugh along with me that I had an idiot moment. The manager called a cab for me after letting me make countless calls on their phone.  Finally we got me a cab and I got the food back to the office. It was great. We had the beef and some Italian sausages with their bread; which was great too. We got some toppings for both like hot peppers and such.  Everyone was so pleased with the food and apparently they have a ton of other great stuff to try as well.  I will definitely go back here because of the food but how can you not after having such awesome service when you're such an idiot?,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I always feel guilty when I write a review for a place that specializes in a particular food; e.g. hot dogs; sausage; etc. and I go and order something completely out of the norm.  Please take that as a disclaimer.  In this case; I visited the renowned Portillo's Hot Dogs and ordered what?  A vegetable sandwich.  Guilty as charged.  Once I read the description on the menu; I knew I had to try it.  It promised me freshly grilled veggies;  mushrooms and Havarti cheese on grilled foccacia.  The promise of yum.  Unfortunately; the sandwich didn't really deliver.  The positives:  it was large (enough for two meals) and served piping hot.  Unfortunately; I couldn't distinguish the flavor of any of the vegetables.  Everything just combined and it wasn't very tasty.  I think the mushrooms were overpowering.  Again; I get it.  This is not their specialty and I won't hold it against them; too much.  On a positive note; I like their fries.  They were served fresh with just the right amount of salt.  Service was fairly friendly.  The drive-thru is efficient although I got a very confused server who kept trying to deliver the wrong order to my car. Bottom line:  I am game to try it again; when I'm in the mood for a hot dog.,1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Good food and fast service!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Great Chicago experience. Just like the ones back home; no loss of service or quality. Great dogs; great sausage; and awesome atmosphere.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,As a Chicago native; I'm reviewing with that standard in mind. While not bad; this place does fall short a bit. My usual order (for years) has been a hotdog with no tomato and no pepper; a bowl of chili; and fries.  Moving out to AZ; I was sad that I'd only get my Portillo's fix when I flew back to visit family. So when one opened in Scottsdale; I was all over it.  I've been quite a few times at this point.   Hot dog - pretty much as expected. Hasn't let me down.  Chili - gross. I seriously don't know what happened; but it's thicker somehow and lacking something. I tested on my last trip to IL; and it hadn't changed there. It's just bad here.  Fries - hard to mess up. My go-to side.  Onion rings - gross. Super hard; oddly sweet; nothing special.   I use to love the strawberry smoothie; but that's not served here. I did try the chocolate cake shake for the very first time a few days ago and was mightily impressed. I'd never had it before; so I can't compare to IL. While it falls short in a few things; my kids and I have made this our after-zoo spot.   Question though...when on earth did the relish turn neon green? I'm certain it wasn't that color before...?,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Like many other misplaced Chicagoland natives who somehow settled in the valley; the little things are what I miss the most.  One of those little things are the amazing hot dog and italian beef restaurants all over the city and its sprawling suburbs.  Portillo's not only was one of my favorite of those places; but it was the one that my brother and I would ride our bikes over to so we could get a cheap and delicious lunch before hitting up a movie on a random summer afternoon.  With that kind of nostalgic expectations; Portillo's in Scottsdale had a lot to live up to; and guess what?  They hit the mark with a perfect bullseye.  A jumbo hot dog with everything on it (like a good Chicago place even an Arizona Portillo's knows that means no ketchup unless specifically requested); fries; and a piece of chocolate cake!  The 10 year old me; who ate this meal more times than I can even try to remember; couldn't have been any happier.  The dog is pretty much what I remember loving as a kid.  The bun was a lot soggier than it should be; which resulted in the very fresh condiments falling out; but I can forgive that.  The fries were the perfectly crispy \crinkly\"" fries that the best places always served.  The cake was perfectly moist and scrumptious with the very sweet [and unnecessarily too much] frosting that I couldn't get enough of as a child.  My fiancé had the italian beef.  Awesome.  Make sure to order it dipped.  Messy but flavorful.  She also ordered cheese fries (they just give you a container of some cheese sauce that I couldn't stop dipping my fries into).  By the way; the food is cheap!  All that and two soft drinks was only a little more than $20.00.  The line out the door was expected; and even a little daunting; at 6:30 on the Friday night following the grand opening.  The good news; It moved fast.  We got our food and found a table in a little over a half hour.  If that can be done in the first week; then the pace will certainly speed up when the excitement starts to ware down.  If you're not already a Portillo's fan; you may want to wait a few weeks for the hype to die down before you give the place a try.  It's not like there was a shortage of Chicago hot dog and italian beef places around the valley.  But Portillo's is certainly a top notch addition.""",1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,When it comes to Chicago hot dogs or Italian beefs; you cant get better than Portillos!   Sure there are places around the valley to go get a Chicago dog or beef; but Portillos has them all beat hands down.  I got the Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers on top; my wife had their hot dog; and we both had their crinkle fries.  This food was so freakin good; it's like we were back in the windy city.  We went on opening day; and the line was out the door; and wrapped though the parking lot.  This didn't phase us; as the food is well worth the wait.  I cant estimate how many people were standing in line; but it took us about 1.5 hours to get our food.  The staff at Portillos were on top of it though! Tables were being cleaned as fast as they were being filled; cooks were sending out food as fast as possible; and all employees had very positive attitudes.  Bottom line: Awesome food & great service! I cant wait to go back!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Having grown up in Chicago; I have very fond memories of Portillo's. Perhaps Portillo's changed since branching out or perhaps my memory distorts the truth. Going to Portillo's in Scottsdale was like watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as an adult--I don't know what I ever saw in this.  To begin; I visited twice: once during peak hours and once in between the lunch and dinner rush. During peak hours; the wait was long; I was scolded for taking a picture inside; the order was incorrect; and the burgers were similar in quality to Wendy's. The second visit wasn't much better. I entered the drive through to see more attendants than cars and waited 15 minutes for a cheeseburger with only one car ahead of me. Upon arriving home; the fries were only half full; the soda was mostly ice; and the burger was a soggy mess of mayo and ketchup. I took three bites of the burger and tossed it in the trash.  The food doesn't live up to the hype or the price. I will not be returning.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"It's difficult to say anything bad about this place. Even when it's busy; which is always; there service is always efficient and I'm not waiting any longer than most other \fast food\"" restaurants. I remember this restaurant when being in Chicago; very happy it's the same great quality out in Arizona now!""",1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"My buddy Dave G. recently wrote an updated review on Portillos.  There are like a gazillion transplants from Chicago out here in AZ; so they have 2 of them.  After reading his review; it made me realize that the last time I was there (Buena Park); I left a bit disappointed.  I wanted to go see a movie that was close by; so I decided to stop and get some lunch.  Redemption?  Yes!  I got there early at like 10:40am.  There were maybe 5 other people in the joint.  I walked up and placed my order for a Jumbo Dog with mustard; onions and relish; a Maxwell Street Polish; a Large Cheese Fries; and a Large Diet Coke.  My total was just under $12.00.  Not the cheapest lunch; but it was substantial and kept me full most of the day.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later; they called my number and I picked up my order.  Here is how everything tasted...............  Jumbo Hot Dog-  Delicious!  I didn't go full Chicago style on this one.  I'm not the biggest fan of tons of toppings.  Mustard; onion and sometimes relish and I am a happy man.  This dog was great!  It was large; plump and beefy!  It was encased in a soft; steamed poppyseed bun and then topped with mustard; onions and plenty of neon green relish.  I really liked the dog and for the .34 cents more than a regular dog; it is well worth going with the jumbo.  Pretty much a must order every time here.  Maxwell Street Polish-  The last time I had this I was extremely disappointed.  The onions were too watery; the bun was soggy and the sausage didn't taste that great.  This time around it was better than last time; but not as good as it could have been. The caramelized onions they use are plentiful; but they destroy the bun.  They soften it up too fast.  The Polish sausage itself was a bit lacking too.  It wasn't that flavorful and had a weird texture.  They skimped on the mustard too.  I ate the whole thing and it wasn't \bad\"" per say; but give me a Teds Polish any day of the week over this thing.  I doubt I will order it again.  I would get 2 Jumbo Dogs instead.  Large Cheese Fries-  These are probably my favorite thing here!  Whatever it is; their cheese sauce is just fantastic.  Its piping hot; creamy and it sticks to the fries perfectly.  They use a crinkle cut fry here and they are fried and salted nicely.  A quick dunk in the molten cheese and you have yourself a winner.  Their fries are in the same pricing scheme as their dogs.  A small fry is only like .20 cents less than a large.  Why even get a small?  For .20; you get way more fries.  The cashier was friendly and the guy that gave me my food was cheery.  They still aren't my favorite hot dog in AZ (Teds holds a special place in my heart); but a jumbo dog and some cheese fries are a guaranteed winner!  This visit redeemed my faith in Portillos and I'm sure I will be back soon enough!   Thanks for planting the seed; Dave G ;-)""",1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I was a bit sad since I used to frequent the Uncle Sam's that was here; but all my regrets are definitely gone. Portillo's is a sick joint and I hope it's here to stay.  Taking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant. Akin to something like Five Guys; you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter. They even have a separate counter for serving desserts.   The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction; but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me; the Italian beef attracts the most customers. The gravy is excellent; and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves. The bread does the sandwich justice; but it's good but not great. I personally like the combo; which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beef.  The sides are not something to shirk at either. The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz.   To top everything off; this entire restaurant even has a drive thru; which totally works!  The menu is huge; so I'm far from exhausting my limit here. I hear the salads are pretty good; and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually. However; it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back.,0

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Whipped in here for lunch today; joined by Ursula D.; Marvin A.; Georgie M. and Mike C.  Arriving at 11 AM; the place was already packed.  Here was the long and short of this hot dog place for me:  After waiting a little while in line to order (ok); I went with an Italian Beef Sandwich (fully dipped) and a Jumbo Hot Dog with everything; char-grilled.  Up at the register; girl advised me that it would take seven minutes for my order to come up if I wanted my hot dog char-grilled.  (Ok.)  THE NOT-SO-GOOD:  ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LATER my order was ready; and a lot of this time was spent standing right at the pickup counter; as there was not way in hell to hear your number called in this EXTREMELY NOISY restaurant.  It was the loudest place I have ever been in my life except near a stage with a loud band playing.  It was hard to converse with my friends at the table and ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to talk to the staff members at the pickup counter; much less hear them call your number over the PA system!  So it's ONE STAR & we're out of here; right?  Well; almost!     :-O  THINGS GET BETTER:    Finally the order came up and Manager lady apologized to me for the long wait (I could tell what she was doing by body language; not voice) & she handed me a big piece of complimentary Chocolate Cake to go with my order.  That was nice; & we're up to TWO STARS.     :-|  Back over at the table; I picked up my Italian Beef & took a big bite.  WOW; it was terrific!  To make a long story short; so was the hot dog (& later the cake).  YUM!  THREE STARS!     :-)  Lastly; the value was excellent (without counting the free cake).  The Italian Beef Sandwich was priced well at $5.25 and so was the Jumbo Hot Dog at $2.99.  Lots of other interesting things on the menu to try at a future date; too.  Up now to FOUR STARS!     :-)  SO; I can't give this place 5 Stars this time because of the very long wait to order & receive the food; plus the extreme loudness; but there was nothing negative to say about the food here.  What I had was all just great; & there are enough other tempting treats on the menu to keep someone coming back for a long time without getting tired of the place.  Next time I'll arrive at opening time of 10:30 (the same as you have to do at In-N-Out) & that just might get them up to 5 Stars.  The food certainly did IT'S part today!     :-)),0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Had a great visit to this placed today; joined by Jackie R.; Georgie M.; Robyn N. & Mike C.  Things were busy at 11 this morning; but not as crazy as last time with the deafening noise & so on (see original Review).  Today ordering; getting the food and enjoying it all went fine.  I had a regular \Hot Dog with Everything\""; Onion Rings and a \""Small\"" Chocolate Malt; which wasn't small (18 oz?); & was nice & thick; just the way I like them.  ALL THREE WERE FIVE STARS.  Now I really love this place & the prices are very reasonable too!     :-))  Hot Dog:  $2.59; Onion Rings:  $2.09; Small (actually pretty large) Chocolate Malt:  $2.69""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Really fun atmosphere for a fast food counter service kind of place w/ a drive through.  Jumbo hot dogs are super yummy; service is always great; employees are courteous; etc.  The only thing I think sucks is that these super nice employees are forced to stand out in the AZ heat to take the drive through orders.  What happened to the old fashioned speaker systems.  I feel so sorry for them.  I think that is really stupid and sad.  They say it gets orders processed and out quicker; but I don't see how it could really make that much of a difference.  I wish they would change their policy on this.  They are out there even when it's not super busy for no apparent reason.,1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"We have been to Portillos in the Chicago area many times & are never disappointed; so when we saw they had one in Scottsdale; we jumped at the chance to go not once; but twice; while we were in the Valley.   We were not disappointed at all.  We felt like we were back in Chi-town!  The Italian beef was as great as ever; then I saw that they have a \combo\"" sandwich with Italian sausage & beef together!  So I asked my brother who lived in Chicago about this & he said that's all he ever gets!  So we came back a second time & I had that & OMG - it's heavenly!   I also had their chocolate cake shake!  Maybe it's the \""kid in me\""; but it reminded me of when you were having cake & ice cream & you mix them together! One tip - when you order; hang close to the pick up counter; they DO NOT call order numbers in exact order & it's quite boisterous in there; so you can miss your number (which on the first visit; we did & I'm pretty sure someone took our order).  They quickly made it for us again; but lesson learned; the 2nd time; I stayed close & made sure to grab our order as soon as it came up!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,So good! Chili Cheese dog and chess fries I always order. They get you in and out of there. Run just like the ones in Chicago I have gone to. Kinda far for me so worth the drive!,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I'm a big fan of Portillos; but lately they seem to be slipping; perhaps the heat is doing it.  I went through the drive thru.  So I order a garbage salad.  I get home.  The Salad is a little bit wilted. The leaves have a high number of thick stocks.  I order an extra poppy seed muffin because I love them and they charged me for it; but they gave me only one.  I look for a straw for my drink and there wasn't any. So you folks at Portillos need to get your ordering and delivery system back in shape.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"My wife; daughter and I braved the lines and the cold to be here on opening night. We met up with a great group of Yelpers for Georgie's UYE. Thankfully; those aforementioned Yelpers had saved us a spot in the INCREDIBLY long line. I mean; seriously...I think I overhead people speaking of their wait time in hours...plural. That's ridiculous. I don't know that I've ever seen people that excited for a hot dog.  While we waited; we witnessed the amazing employees making their way through the crowds (both in the parking lot waiting to get in; as well as the seemingly endless lines of cars making their way through the drive-thru). Portillo's DEFINITELY has their stuff together when it comes to managing the masses.   After our sojourn through the crowds; we finally made it inside. By this time; we had already chosen our food; and were just waiting to make it to the register. That gave us quite a bit of time to take in the sights. Now; being that I'm not from Chicago; I had to lean heavily on my great company for authenticity. According to the two greatest kings this city has known; Portillo's definitely gets an A+ in that department. Apparently; each Portillo's has it's own special theme. This one has a 50's retro vibe. After all...retro is cool again. Go figure.  As I've mentioned before; I'm not a HUGE fan of hot dogs. They're alright; they're just not my favorite. My wife and I each got the Supreme dog...which we thought would be...I don't know; supreme; I guess. Ultimately; it was sizable; but for something to be called \supreme\"";  I guess I just expected a lot more. It wasn't much bigger than the Ballpark Franks you can buy at the grocery store. It probably didn't help that my hot dog was on a table next to a GARGANTUAN beef sandwich. Talk about buyer's remorse...but; I digress.  For me; the best part of this place was the dessert. We ordered the Chocolate Cake Shake. I thought it would just be a chocolate shake that magically tasted like chocolate cake. Little did I know; they actually take a piece of some of the richest chocolate cake I've ever tasted; mix it with ice cream; and stir it all up. If ever there was a dessert that made me want to immediately get tested for diabetes; this was it. It was SO thick! I ended up having to eat the last bits of it with a spoon. This shake is definitely a game changer!  If you're a Chicago native (which there seem to be a lot of out here); then you'll undoubtedly love this place. If you're a hot dog enthusiast; you'll probably like it; too. If you don't really like hot dogs; then what are you doing here in the first place?  And if you love an AMAZING chocolate cake shake; then you'll DEFINITELY love it!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Atmosphere is very casual; and if you aren't familiar with the menu; your first time will require you to take a few minutes to process the myriad choices available to you (Italian beef; Italian sausage; hot dog; chili dog; chicken tenders; fried halibut; fries; with cheese; and/or without chili; hot peppers; sweet peppers; chocolate cake; or strawberry milkshake; you name it; and this Midwest restaurant favorite may make you miss home...  Takes me back to my days working at Barney 's Ribs (another Portillo brand).  Oh; and everything is a la carte!  Mom enjoyed her chili cheese dog; ate it all; and even though she suffered tremendous pain from the onions and beans; she wanted to have another one the next day!  (I told her maybe once-a-week is a better option- too much sodium; you know.)  The beef was good; but I didn't really care for it in a croissant; as I prefer eating crispy; flaky layers; and not the soggy mess I had for lunch.  There also wasn't much cheese; except in the corners of the roll.  Will never order it again!    $0.60 for two strips of roasted hot peppers is a bit much...,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Ate a few hotdogs from this location. Same as the one in Tempe. So that's good!  Amazing menu with Chicago style food. The service is decently fast but I think it's the taste that matters at Portillos. Still haven't tried the entire menu. I have tried hotdogs; tamales; and sausages. Still debating if I want to try their salads and fancy burgers. Somehow; I associate this place with hotdogs.  Anyway; it's not healthy. At least the hotdogs and sausages but extremely delicious! If you are looking for fast food; this is the place. Skip the other chains.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"First things first; so you don't get it twisted:  I'm kinda a Luke's girl...or Al's girl...Joey's girl...DeFalco's girl...Chicago Burger Company's girl...ok; I guess it's time to face it. I'm an Italian beef sandwich whore.  I don't think I've met one that I didn't like. And now that this place is really close to work; I'm adding Portillo's to my dance card...  Yesterday a couple of folks from the office ordered takeout from there...I've been trying to be a good girl and avoid eating out everyday for lunch; but I finally broke down and said \Yes\"" to the mess.   I ordered an Italian beef sandwich with EVERYTHING (how do you know if you REALLY LOOOOVE your new beau if you don't get to know every nook and cranny?) with \""gravy\"" on the side...bless their hearts; they put my grilled onions and mozzarella (all melty and seductive-like) on the sandwich to go and put my \""gravy\""; giardiniera; and peppers on the side...BRILLIANT!   When I got my sandwich; it was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-oh; no sloppy; soppy mess that had been sitting or congealing for the 10 minute commute to tummy-town. I was able to decorate my vittles as I saw fit. The cheese fries were deliciously crispy crinkle cut fries that I was able to dip in the decadent; hot cheesy/jalapeno sauce. And to wash it all down? Sure I could've continued my quest for good-girl status and had water or a V8 but NO! I washed it down with a frosty; cold; bubbly root beer...and I was in heaven.""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,The chili cheese dog was to die for...it still had that awesome snap when I bit into it. The taste was amazing. Service was good and cheese fries I got to dip myself. I will be back!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"I was in Chicago recently and went to the downtown location for a quick meal. I had the Italian beef and a friend had a hot dog.  I regretted not coming back to try a hot dog but; after learning there was a Portillo's in Scottsdale; I figured I'd get one back home.  And I did.  I went here with the same friend. The restaurant's interior looks a lot like the Portillo's in Chicago except it's smaller and newer. This is one of those; walk up to a counter and place your order and then wait until your number is called along with something clever that rhymes with your number; \43 come and see me\"" (the woman in Chicago was much better; the guy in Scottsdale just didn't have his heart in it). You then sit in their large seating area.   My friend got the Italian beef and I got a jumbo hotdog with everything.  Some comparisons - the Italian beef I got in Chicago was tasty but it was was very wet. I mean; running down your arm when you picked it up wet. The Italian beef here was moist but wasn't dripping.  The hotdog was OK. This was my first Chicago-style dog so maybe I just didn't know what to expect. It's a fat beef hotdog with mustard and there are sliced onions; pickles; peppers; etc just laying in the bun along with the hotdog. It was good; just not what I was used to.  My friend said she preferred the Italian beef over the hotdog she got in Chicago. I concur.  On the plus side - $20 for an Italian beef; a jumbo hotdog; a shared side of onion rings and two soft drinks! Nice deal.""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations.   First impressions are not everything. Make no mistake; the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises; all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit); employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!   Unfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all; or maybe it is; just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun; pickle; hot peppers; tomatoes; onions; and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home; they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal.   Some people will gawk at my review and say \Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind.\"" And to that I say \""My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy.

The only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the \""American Dream\"" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food...

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"I FINALLY made it in to the ever popular Portillo's.  I wanted to go for the opening night UYE; but it was just too cold for my thin blood.  So; I waited to go here for a Yelper luncheon.  I met up with  Mike C.; Georgie M; Rand H and Marvin A.  Only girl in the group and that was fine by me!    What an amazingly delicious place.  I left there thinking; I understand the excitement.  What's baffling to me is how a place so big can do; at least; one thing so well.  This was my first time taking a \dip\"" in the Portillo's family of restaurants.  I've been to Chicago plenty; lived in the burbs for a short while; but never heard of Portillo's.  No matter; what I lacked in hearing; I made up for in tasting yesterday.    Oh yeah... this place has been open about 3 or 4 weeks now and the crowd has yet to die down.  I highly doubt that the crowd will.  At any rate; I get there just before 11am and you can tell by noon the place would be packed.  There was a very short line that I hop in to place my order.  I checked out the menu before I arrive and then I wrote down my order so when it was time to order; I just read off my little piece of paper.  But; to be honest; I don't know where their menu is displayed.  I did try to take a last minute peek to see if I wanted to change my order; but I remember thinking; \"" I don't see the menu; just stick to the script.\""  I pay and then I wait for my number to be called.  The place is REALLY REALLY LOUD; so you definitely need to pay attention for you number to be called.    I ordered the half sausage/half beef sandwich - Dipped baby Dipped and with hot and sweet pepper and mozzarella cheese!  What a simply delicious sandwich.  I RARELY eat bread; but I wanted to devour the bread.  the bread was firm; yet soft.  It has a subtle hint of Italian spices that you can definitely taste.  I highly recommend adding the mozzarella cheese for that reason.  I wish I had my sandwich DOUBLE DIPPED!  or more gravy on the side!   I didn't enjoy the sausage; and I would never order that again.  I also ordered the fries.  This is where I kinda got irritated.  YOu can't order a salad for less than 5 dollars there.  I wanted a simple side salad with my sandwich.  I need a reasonable option to make up for the calorie bomb!  But they don't offer a small salad; so I ordered the fries.  Definitely some of the best tasting fries I've had in quite sometime.  The perfect amount of salt with a crisp exterior while hiding the soft warm middle.    I will definitely go back.  I hope sooner than later.""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Although I am a midwesterner by birth; my first experience of Portillos was here in the Valley of the Sun.   I've been super interested to try it; but wanted to wait until the initial craziness was past.   We finally checked it out this past weekend and wow! So yummy.   Parking was crowded; but we found a spot easily enough. There is a nice patio at the front with plenty of seating and tables overshadowed by umbrellas. The restaurant is kitschy; with memorabilia covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling - Flash Gordon poster; bicycle; airplane pedal car...   The dining room is very clean and teeming with staff - we were greeted at arrival; handed paper menus; and ushered into one of two lines stretching up to the counter. We reviewed the menus and when we reached the front of the line; were directed to one of the windows to order. This whole process was a bit frenzied - we didn't really have an ample amount of time to decide on our orders before we hit the front of the line; and when we did; getting up to a window while not cutting off someone from the other line was somewhat stressful. One of our only snags during the dining experience came when we got to the counter and learned that the printed menus that we had been looking over to make our choices were NOT actually current menus. So we had to make some rapid re-selections on-the-fly.   Your order is assigned a number and you have to listen for it to be announced; then go pick it up from the window. The girls announcing that the orders are ready have funny catch phrases for each number: \Fifty Four; wait no more!\"" etc; which is entertaining the first 5 times you hear them (but I'll come back to this)   You pick up your orders on large trays with drink holders in each corner and reminderd me of the trays that used to clip to your car window at A&W Rootbeer stands (if anyone remembers those) They're handy for transporting your food to the table; but are very bulky and get in the way if your table is crowded; like ours was.  We ordered The Italian Beef with spicy peppers and mozzarella; a Grilled Chicken Sandwich; a Hamburger; and a few orders of crinkle french fries.   The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was pretty okay - more \""meh\"" than amazing.   The Hamburger was good - flattened thinner; similar to other midwestern imports (Freddie's; for example) which meant that the flavor was more concentrated and it was crispier than your standard burger. The bread got very soggy and the toppings were in disarray; so it was a mess to eat.   The crinkle fries were okay - we got three orders for the 3.5 of us and I'd probably tailor that down to 2 orders (or maybe even 1) the next time. They came out CRAZY hot; too hot to eat; so we had to wait a bit before digging in. They tasted alright and had good texture; but weren't anything to write home about.  The Italian Beef was; as others say; incredibly good. The beef was sliced very thinly and then piled on thick.  It was savory; juicy; and very flavorful. The bread was pretty thin and did get terribly soggy from the juices of the sandwich. I ordered it with spicy peppers and mozzarella; the mozzarella was barely there; but I was so glad that I ordered the peppers! The juice from the peppers permeated the whole sandwich; giving an extra dimension to the flavors - the peppers themselves were not overwhelmingly spicy; which was nice. There were some little crinkly pickled carrots in the mix as well; which was weird at first but tasted fine. Eating the sandwich is tricky: it comes in two wrappers; a larger outer wrapper that is more \""dry\"" and a more tightly wrapped inner wrapper. I took my sandwich out of the outer wrapper but kept the inner wrapper on so that it would blockade the sogginess and keep the sandwich together. This was a good move; my friend who also got the Italian Beef did NOT do this; and it was a huge mess.   The dining room is very hectic. The seating is bordered by the line of guests; the order counter; the pickup window; and the catering counter. The cacophony of the many guests plus the announcer calling out the orders is definitely less than relaxing.  Hearing \""54 wait no more\"" 100 times while you dine is not so great. However; the decor; very friendly and attentive employees; cleanliness of the restaurant; and overall casual level of the place all make for a very fun experience that was ultimately quite enjoyable.   Pricing was okay - just over $30 for three adults and one baby; so not too bad.   The staff were phenomenal. My expectations are generally pretty low in a place that has really young employees; but you can tell that the training at Portillos is top-notch and that they ask a lot of their team. We were greeted; treated politely and professionally; attended to (they have employees bussing the tables; collecting trash as you finish) and thanked as we left.   I can definitely recommend Portillos for a delicious and lovely casual lunch or dinner. Be sure to check it out!""",1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,What is not to like! Best Chicago beef and Chicago hot dogs in Arizona. It is almost always crowded but the service is great- - whether going through the drive through or eating inside.....prices are fair and the food is plentiful. I've had a couple of the salads too and they are delicious also.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Went to the Grand Opening last night and that hour/20 minute wait was well worth it! Hands down the best Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich I have ever had! My husband lived in Chicago for 12 years and was very happy and impressed with the food and service. It is exactly what he remembered. We had a Hot Dog and Chili Cheese dog too! Both excellent; but the Italian Beef Sandwich is what I will be coming back for!!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Went through the drive through with my family. We wanted to grab some quick desert as we went to another restaurant for dinner across the street. My brother works here so we have been here many times. I got the cake shake which was good but not fantastic. Service was good too.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Food: I thought it was definitely worth the trip across town. Just imagine a Costco dog with all the fixings; including a slice of pickle and some yellow peppers. Simple and delicious. I also tried their dipped beef sandwich; which is actually my preference. Just know that the dipped beef is a little messy to eat and the bread gets real mushy...mmmmm. Can't beat the portions either.  Value: I thought the price was very reasonable for what you get.   Service: Outstanding.  All in all; if you've never been to a Portillo's; I highly recommend. It's like Chi-town's In-N-Out. Even if you end up not liking it; I think you'll appreciate the experience.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,i know that portillos is known for their hot dogs and italian beef but i must say that their salads are great! a little disorganized in the drive through but that was during their opening week; i have been back since and am happy to say that the food and service are A1.  reminds me of back home.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Went for dinner last night with the wife; daughter and sister.  Been wanting to come here since they opened but wanted to wait til they slowed down.  What better time in Scottsdale but a muggy August night. Now this place started literally 3 miles where I grew up (Elmhurst; Il) so I new what to expect.  Really impressed by the wide open restaurant.  Food was as I remembered. The only complaint I have is if you order a salad it comes out in a totally different location then the rest of the deliciousness.  Where is the soda machine for refills?  Didn't want to go up and ask for a refill for 2 reasons: would have been disappointed if they said they charged and I was going home to drink Sierra Nevada. Also;they need to be more attentive to the restroom; no paper towels but they had an environmentally caring jet driven hand blower that got the job done.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Ate there about a month ago and have been meaning to write a review; but couldn't remember the name of the place. Good food; good service; but definitely not AS AMAZING as everyone says; but we are in AZ and everything is relative; so maybe I should be giving them 5 stars. Is 4.5 an option? And who is the pea brained moron who gave them a 1 star?,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,My boss surprised our office with portillos and it was the most amazing hotdog place; took me back to the times i was a kid playing in chicago. this place blows all the other hotdog places out the water. Please avoid hometown dogs worse experience ever just drive the extra miles for an amazing dog from this fine establishment awesome customer service as well.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,First time diner here at Portillos and overall I have to say I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. I had the beef and cheddar croissant which was good but too soggy for my liking. ( I've heard that's a Chicago thing?! ) I also tried some of the southwest BBQ chicken salad. Portillos is definitely not the place to order a salad. The lettuce wasn't fresh and the dressing was more like water. Stick to the hot dogs which were really tasty! The most amazing thing I've had so far? Chocolate cake shake. Which is a MUST try. You will not disappointed; that's a promise! The staff was also very friendly and helpful definitely a plus!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Finally a Portillo's I can get to without going to Chicago! Was down in the Phoenix area a couple weeks ago and drove all the way to Scottsdale just to visit this location. The food is awesome and just as good as the Portillo's that I remember in Chicago. Although the parking lot was packed when I got there; there was pretty much no line to order and the food here is cranked out very quickly. You can even watch them make your food in the window to the left of the cashiers. Their combo italian beef/sausage sandwiches are to die for. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in the area. Who knows; if I have a craving I might even drive down from Vegas just to eat here!,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Delicious food... Had the Italian beef sandwich combo with sausage. Very friendly and efficient staff along with reasonable prices...definitely will be back as Portillo's may very well become my fast food to go place!  In fact; I ate there twice today! I went back later on in the day and had their cheddar and beef croissant which was to die for...Also had a chocolate shake but it wasn't rich enough for my taste.  The staff is very well organized and despite going back at night; we waited a very short amount of time for our food.  Well...Maybe I'm not such a devoted fan after all...Last time I went thru the drive thru; they screwed up my order. I called them to let them know - and the manager said he would send me a certificate...well; I never got anything...so they're full of it...but I still like them no matter what...I don't feel like crying because the sausage was missing in action...,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Make sure you know what you want before getting in line.  Even though the restaurant was busy; there were two lines with an employee at each line taking orders. We were overwhelmed at how fast we made it to the front of the line. My wife and I ordered a Hot Dog (Chicago Style) each; split an Italian Beef sandwich with sweet pickles and I ordered a large milkshake.  NOTE: They ask if you want sweet or hot peppers which implies that it comes with it; but it's 50 cents more. So if you don't want any peppers; tell them 'NONE'.  We paid for our meal and was given a receipt with our order number on it. In ten minutes; they called our order. Opening the Italian Beef sandwich was messy and greasy with so-so flavor. My wife's hot dog was also greasy but my hot dog wasn't. The 'dogs' where okay; but I'm going to try Sonic's foot long Chicago dog to see if there is any difference. The set up is like an In and Out Hamburger joint where the prices are reasonable and you order at one section and go the the pickup station when your number is called.,1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Hugely overrated. I get it though; there's few good Chicago joints in town so Chicagoan's have to come here for this kind of food.  It's good for what it is and the service really is fantastic but the hype has caused crazy long lines which don't justify the wait in my book.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Had the Italian Beef today and it reminded me of the good ole days in Chicago. Moving to Phoenix made me miss all my favorites from Chicago. The Italian Beef was sheer heaven! Went through drive thru and and our order was perfect. Employees were friendly and knowledge. I will definitely be back!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Absolutely delicious. Been there 6 times in the last 10 days. Had everything on menu from a chili cheese dog to chocolate  cake shake(just amazing) you can not go wrong here no matter what you order. If you are like me and from back east where the good food lives you will get a smile with every bite thinking you are back home til you realize it's 120 outside and reality sets in but good thing is you'll be full... Lol,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Have you ever been to a small food-shop owned by an immigrant of any nationality where they seem to be skimping on everything to make ends meet? Common; we have all been to those places. You ask for an extra side of their delicious ethnic sauce and they want those two quarters in your pocket. They charge for the three day old iced tea. I understand for they are a small establishment. Portillo's is a big Corporate operation.   Well; cheap owner of Portillo's; can you put in a self-serve beverage refill counter? I do not want to have to go awkwardly across the pick up line to get another beverage. This is Arizona. We expect free refills with 105 degree weather.    At least you replaced uncle Sam's. That clown didn't even have blue cheese for his wings.    Oh yes; this is what happens when you skimp on beverage service in Arizona. In my dehydrated state I am not getting to the food until the middle of the review. The Italian Beef was excellent but small. I would like a 8 - 10 inch option for a couple extra bucks. The gardinere * lasted a few bites into the sandwich. Again; is there a guy fresh off the 747 skimping on food cost involved with  the operation?   Yes. I will return to Portillo's because it is good and well priced. I will pay extra for a couple of extra inches on a sandwich. In fact; I am back at the office now and still hungry. Maybe I will return for that delicious Italian Beef.   Oh yes; the employees were excellent at executing efficient counter service during a peak hour.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I've been traveling to Chicago off and on for the last couple of years for work and while there I always try to hit Portillo's.  So imagine my surprise while I was in Phoenix this past weekend to discover a brand new Portillo's right there in Scottsdale.  It's pretty much the same experience I have when in Chicago.  The staff was friendly and efficient which on my visit was definitely nice since the place was so busy.  Seriously; I realize it's new but I was surprised at the draw this place had.  In any case; the staff made the crowd much less of an ordeal than it could have been due to their organization.  So kudos to the management for good planning.  As to the food...well I of course had a hot dog and ordered it through the garden which is basically what we'd call a Chicago dog outside of Chicago.  Hot dog and veggies!  It's healthier that way right?  My friend and I also split an Italian beef sandwich which we ordered hot and dipped.  If you've never had this culinary delight; it's like a roast beef sandwich with some hot peppers and then the whole thing is soaked in the juice from the meat.  You may have to use a fork to eat it but your taste buds won't care!  It was all very tasty.   My friend who lives in Phoenix was sold and planned to go back again.  If i lived there; I'm certain I would be darkening Portillo's doors often too.  It's good food.   Really.  Go and enjoy!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,OK; so after 2 tries; I'm giving this a 2 star review; which is a bit negative. Place is colorful as all get-out; and fun; loud; and kind of exciting first time you visit. After the 2nd time though; I think it's a tad overpriced for all the fanfare. And; yet we have another fast food joint; made to be a restaurant; where you have to pick up your own food.   Note to all restauarnt owners... If I want to pay high prices for food; bring it to me! I don't want to stand in line; I don't want to wait for my name to be called; just bring the damn thing to my table. Hell... Even Carl's Jr. brings your order to where I am sitting. I'm not lazy. It's just stupid to pay restaurant prices for fast food; in a sense. It's not that often I crave a chili dog. But I can grab a can of Hormel's chili for a buck; and package of hot dogs for 2 bucks; and with cheese and inions; I can feed myself and 4 friends for about a buck each. What's the difference between my deal and this place? About Ten Frickin' Dollars I tell ya'. I can get a better hot dog at Costco; thank you very much. Won't be returning.  And all you people from Chicago... Always talking about your town... Selling out the Diamondback games when your beloved Cubs are in town... Welcome Chicago to the Desert; etc. etc. Why did ya'all leave; and why are you here; if it's such a gosh-darn great town?????????,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Love love love this place.... The all time question is what's better a Chicago dog with everything on it. Or the beef sandwich dipped with hot peppers. Order both lol and top it of with a cake milkshake if you can.  Oh gluttony I never knew you till I met you at portillos.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"This is a happenin' place! I often feel rushed when I get in line to order because they have a person carrying a notepad or something taking our order as we stand in line; so I don't really get to peruse the menu to see what I want - an option is to get out of line to read the menu; but considering how busy it is; you need to stand in line; get your order and hope to get a table to sit at.  I'm not a HUGE hot dog fan; so I usually just order the \hot dog\"". It comes with everything including: mustard; relish; freshly chopped onions; sliced red ripe tomatoes; kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.  The best part is the poppy seed bun. So soft and warm!  They also have crinkle fries that are also really good.  I'd definitely keep coming back to this place as there are many other things on the menu that I want to try.""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Well; I've been a few times and it's been pretty good. I love their hot dogs; aside from the fact that their mustard is bland and the only reason you know it's mustard is because it's yellow... But the reason I'm writing is that one of my coworkers and my boss just went and got salads. My boss got the wonton chicken salad without the wontons; not that bad I know; but this was 1/2 an hour after my coworker got a grilled chicken salad with no chicken and no side muffin. Adding this to my own experiences where the Italian Beef was really bland (and yes; I got the peppers and gravy so it was soggy; slimy and bland) and when I ordered cheese fries the cheese was all over the inside of the bag and not in the container; well; I think I'll stick with driving a ways to Uncle Sam's.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Visited Portillos recently and will say that the Italian beef and sausage sandwich is my favorite sandwich in the world. Bursting with flavor from the sweet and hot peppers. The service was fantastic and they now have new location in Tempe.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Hmmm... This review is probably one of the most difficult to write.   I live within 3 miles of this restaurant. I have driven past many times and always wondered what it was about.  when I saw the reviews on yelp I thought it was worth a try.  However I really don't understand why people would give this four stars. It's a cheap and not very good burger joint... With some hot dogs and want to be sausages.  I ordered it Thai and meet and sausage sandwich... And it was just a big soggy nasty mess. Not very appetizing and not very good at all.  The french fries are like you buy from the store frozen Oreda. They're not well cooked or well seasoned or unique at all.    The salad bar is a joke... It looks like a mess and not very good options or tasty offerings.  The hamburgers are plain and disgusting. Not much thought no uniqueness. It's not even as good as cooking at home.  The chocolate cake was disgusting.   People will review saying it's cheap and good... But it's not even cheap. You and up paying nearly 5 bucks for a hamburger and fries. Smash burger is far better for the same money.  I really have a hard time understanding what people see in this place.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,LOVE IT! Being Italian and from the Northeast; a roast beef sandwich is like a weekly must have!! My dad kept raving about this place so i finally went with him to see what he has been talking about for the past 5 months. I ordered the Roast beef sandwich with mozzarella cheese and hot peppers with a coke. IT WAS SO GOOD! The roast beef was cut perfectly and tasted amazing! The bread was crispy on the outside but the inside had absorbed all that roast beef juice and flavor! This was like heaven to my lips! It brought back those heavenly flavors and memories of when I was a fat kid visiting my grandparents and eating roast beef sandwiches for dinner! I now see what my dad was telling me about!  I found my new favorite place in Scottsdale! The place itself reminded me of New York; New Jersey; or Chicago and they were very quick to make the order. This place is great for when I am craving those foods I usually get back east.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I love Portillo's. Great Italian Beef. Dogs etc. Have to check your order carefully as they do make mistakes. Sometimes their quality control/portion control is a bit off...Beef sandiwiches are usually stuffed and flowing over...on occasion..they can be skimpy..staff is usually helpful and polite and responsive.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Not sure what all the low ratings are about.  If you are not from Chicago you won't understand.  Tasted great just like their Chicago locations.  Very consistent product and service.  I was visiting family in Peoria Az and they had a taste for Portillo's so we took the 1 hire ride.  Prices are fair; ultimate comfort food.   I ordered a beef sandwich and a charbroiled burger.  Don't forget to try the chocolate fudge cake.,1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I actually go to Portillo's a couple of times a month but not because the food is so great; or the atmosphere; or even the price.  It's simply convenient -- close to home and you get your food quickly since you order at a register and then pick it up at the counter.  Ambiance is zero inside; and the outside patio features car fumes.  The roast beef sandwich is probably their best item.  The rest - average.  The fries; sweet potato fries; and onion rings are all just ok or maybe a bit less.  The hot dogs are fine; but try making them Sonora style and you might have something.  If you are passing buy and are hungry and are willing to spend about $10 for a sandwich and fries; Portillo's will do.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I am originally from Chicago; and I have discovered that a good Italian Beef sandwich is very hard to come by outside of the Chicago area. Enter Portillo's a Chicago-based restaurant. I love the Beef and Cheddar Croissant. It is what I order from Portillo's almost every time I am in one of their restaurants when I am back home; and it wAs a very pleasant surprise to find a Portillo's in the desert!  The food is great and the service is pretty good. I was thrown off a tad when i ordered my sandwich sweet and wet; a term that most Chicagoans would easily understand; and the young lady behind the cash register looked at me like I was crazy. Fortunately; I was able to translate the lingo into layman's terms pretty easily; and it got me one of the best Beef and Cheddar Croissants that I have had.,1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This place has the best Italian beef sandwich I have ever had hands down! Beats out Al's beef without a doubt. I ordered a beef with extra gravy and sweet peppers . Wow they have the gravy down awesome sandwich .   Everything holds together perfect; the bread does not fall apart even with the extra gravy .the sweet peppers were a perfect combination with the beef . You can even add mozzarella ; which I didn't honestly it does not need cheese .  I hope the food stays consistent ; which I know some  places have this issue. When I went to Al's i thought wow this sandwich was awesome ; no wonder why they are so popular in Chicago . Then I read about Portillo's  a lot of Chicagoans saying Portillo's  had the best Italian beef on Chicago.  I thought to myself no way I don't see how they can beat out Al's  ; boy was I wrong ; do yourself a favor and get one with the  extra gravy and sweet peppers if you like peppers .,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I wish I could own a franchise of Portillos! Seriously. My Dad went to the original location growing up; and it's my boyfriend's favorite restaurant (he is also from Chicago). Their food is perfect; the customer service is second to none; and their training is what makes it all happen. I love you so much; Portillos!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I finally got a chance to check this fine place out with the wife. Wow it is still pretty busy with lots of families everywhere enjoying themselves and having a tasty treat at the same time. I even saw several groups giving each other hugs with excitement as they gathered up together.  Both inside and out are very clean and well decorated with style. It is fun just going around and looking at all the cool items hanging on the wall. This place is oiled like a well tuned machine. Simply walk up and order; pay; then step to the side and pick up your food. You can watch them diligently working in the kitchen to get the orders to perfection. Cool!  Had to get a Jumbo Dog Chicago Style which is basically what they call everything. Also tried out the Beef and Cheddar on a Croissant with Sweet Peppers. The wife ordered an Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers and a large side of Cheese Fries to share.  The food was really tasty and fresh. I particularly liked the Dog which was created perfectly and had a great flavor profile. The Beef and Cheddar was also very tasty but seemed to be a little skimpy on the beef. The basic Fries and Cheese was hypnotically good. Maybe I'm just a sucker for that kinda cheesy goodness. They also have Burgers; Chicken Sandwiches; Salads; plus a whole lot more.  Nice place and I would definitely go back again. Would like to see the foot traffic for the order line go around the outside of the dinning area instead of cutting right through the middle and creating a criss cross of confusion for those eating; trying to get a napkin; or a refill. Maybe hiring a Feng shui Master to give it an adjustment. Reversing the kitchen would be too expensive at this point. LOL!  Grab a menu or study it before hand. A lot of people have a list of what they want already. Just remember - Go Cubbies & Da Bears!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I'm a Chicagoland native and couldn't wait for the arrival of Portillos to the desert. This place does a lot really well - Italian beef; sausage; burgers; chicken sandwich; salads; desserts and; of course; hot dogs. Great prices. Bottled water for 69 cents! Great atmosphere and outstanding service for a fast good joint. My only disappointment is that they didn't bring to Arizona the Barnelli's side of the restaurant. Two requests for Mr. Portillo - please bring Barnelli's and please; please build in the Northwest valley - Peoria; Arizona would be great in honor of its sister city in Illinois.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Do you need to be from Chicago to understand what makes Portillo's a cult favorite?  Perhaps.  Even so; Portillo's is good.  Portillo's is really big and as crowded as it gets; and it does get crowded; there is always a place to sit.  Lines can be long at times but move swiftly.  The staff is courteous and efficient.  Portillo's is set up with an order counter; a pick up counter and general seating.  The menu is large.  I had the Italian beef sandwich with a generous dunk of gravy.  I was surprised to find the spices I did on the meat; I did get red pepper flakes and wish I would have known as I am allergic.  It was still tasty though.    Do I crave Portillos'?  No.  Would I make the drive just to go get Portillo's?  No.  Would I eat here again.  Sure; when in the area.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Can I get a sweet jesus or even a hell ya!!! Best hot dog I have EVER had!!!  This place is super cute! I love the way it's set up; very open; fits a ton of people; cute little patio out front; they have a convenient drive through and have a great mix of old school/Chicago decor; set up in a modern way (if that makes any sense)  The menu is larger then I thought it would be there are salads; hamburgers; chicken sandwiches and of course hot dogs!! I decided to go with the Jumbo Chili Dog; Cheese fries and a drink! Wish I had room for dessert; or a chocolate shake! Definitely going to order that next time! A lot of places over cook hot dogs; or have awful tasting chili they pile on top. It's nice to actually get a perfectly cooked/juicy hot dog; on a delicious seasoned bun; with flavorful chili! Ohhh and the fries! I LOVE crinkle fries.... a lot of places stopped serving them! Portillos hit home with me with the crinkle fires! Nice and crispy; crunchy; the way crinkle fries should taste!  Overall great experience! This place is very laid back; casual; family and date friendly! The staff is very courteous and welcoming! Worth the lines and the kayos! I recommend going later at night around 9pm is when we went (I know that is late to eat) but there were no lines; received our food in about 5 minutes; sat and enjoyed each others company while people watching and took the long drive home!  This specific location is about and hour away from my house; but certainly worth the drive! I can't wait for them to open up their new location this summer at Tempe Market Place!  Great night! Thanks for finally making it to AZ Portillos!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I have been to Portillo's in Chicago; and love that they are now here in Scottsdale.  The entire staff is fast; friendly; and efficient.  The atmosphere is great and somewhat retro.  The food - I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich and it was great.  My friend ordered the burger; which she enjoyed.  Next time I plan to try the croissant beef sandwich.  Great family place; and packed for lunch!  Plan ahead; but still quick.  A must visit place.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,WOW! The best beef sandwich these lips have ever tasted. I ordered a beef sandwhich w/ hot peppers; a hotdog w/ everything; & a chocolate cake shake. The prices are very reasonable & like others have said the employees busted *ss today. I will definatly be back w/ a bunch of friends. YUM.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Had lunch here today withUrsula D. Marvin A.Georgie M. and Rand H. Well I had the Italian beef sandwich (wet) and a jumbo dog Charred and a piece of chocolate cake. Everything I ate was very good. I would have given this place 5 stars if they managed the busy place a little better. They call your number over a P A system when your food is ready and it is very hard to hear to say the least.They need boards like the D.M.V. that say now serving 143 at window 5. If they had that you would at least be able to see when your order was ready.I take away one star for that ;but the food here is as good as it gets (5 stars) yummm.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Anyone that has spent any amount of time in Chicago or its surrounding suburbs knows about Portillo's.  These folks will not look to Yelp for a recommendation.  The Portillo's beef is legendary.    For those not accustomed to Portillo's this is the place to go for a true Italian beef.  I've had a few out here.  With the exception of Dazzo's Dog House I have not been impressed.  Portillo's delivers the goods.  You can also get Chicago dogs; Italian sausage; burgers; chicken sandwiches; catering; shakes; malts and killer fries.    The restaurant is large and will accommodate a lot of people even with the hoards flocking to a new restaurant.   For my money you cannot beat the beef sandwich dipped with mozzarella.  It's my standard order.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"I know that you're from Chicago And I know you may taste good But I just can't be this hungry anymore Portillo's  Don't call my name. Don't call my name; Portillo's I'm just a Yelper I'm just a Yelper; Fortillo's  Don't wanna kiss; just want a bite Just want some fries and onion rings Don't call my name. Don't call my name; Bortillo's  Portillo's Portillo's Porta porta tillos Porta porta tillos (Lyrics - Lady Gaga - Alejandro)  Portillos is now a chain around the nation; but its origin is very simple back in Chicago.  Seems like all my Chi-town peeps love this place and can't get enough of it.  I always joke why this place has all the hype is because Chi-town folks have big mouths!  LOL -- gotta love my Chicago peeps!    Needless to say; this place is slamming with patrons salivating to get a taste of a Chicago style hotdog!  The place itself has nostalgic signs hanging from the ceiling and walls.  I gather these are all old school Chicago neighborhoods or Chicago based signage; along with some vintage photography.  Not too easy on the eyes; but whatever!  I ordered the Chicago Style dog of course along with some cheese fries and onion rings.  I also had a taste of their Polish dog too.  I thought the Polish dog was okay at best.  It was just grilled onions on a polish dog and bread -- um okay.  The Chicago style is always my favorite.  Pickles; tomatoes; onions; jalapenos and a hot dog.  You thought I was gonna sing the Big Mac song didn't you!?  Truthfully; I thought the hot dog was okay at best.  I think it was over hyped and you can get this \Chicago Style\"" hot dog anywhere in the valley that sells \""Chicago Style\"" hot dogs.  I think it's say that this place was the talk of the town when it first opened and sadly it didn't deliver!  It's like watch Transformer 2 and 3 -- what the heck happened!?   At the end of the day; I think if you haven't experienced it yet; then I would recommend this place.  However; you're if you're expecting miracles in your palates and the site of a food deity; then please pass on by cause it's not your religion. - Enjoy!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,My review is based on the food and take out experience.   1st the food - had Italian beef; chili dogs; cheese fries and onion rings;  Food was good; portions a bit on the small side.  The large fries were not that large (ok maybe I am getting spoiled by Five Guys).  Thought the Italian beef could have used something else; I did get the peppers added; but they should also include grilled onions.  BUT; they FORGOT the gravy on the side  for the Italian beef.  And this after I ordered it; and even read back the order when we picked it up; and confirmed that they included with the order.  And when we got home; NO gravy (I think they got confused; as we ordered cheesy fries; and probably thought that was the gravy).  How can you have an Italian beef without the gravy.  Very disappointed that they forgot it.  Take out is easy; very friendly staff.  Next time; will double check the gravy.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I finally made it out here today and I absolutely loved it.  The place was packed!!  O my goodness loads of people!!  The place is huge; with an enormous amount of signage and colorful décor.  Ton's of tables; and lots of people helping.  The lines here were long; but I didn't spend more then 15 minutes between the time I stood in line and got my food.  they have two lines here. One for ordering; one for food pickup.  They had all 4 registers open; with girls throughout the line taking your order and writing it down for you to make things go quicker.  Once I got to the register; things went fine.  They sent me over to the pickup line where you grab your drinks and food.  That was the longer line of the two; and you kind of stand around in this clustered area waiting for your number to be called.  Being that this place was packed; there was an enormous amount of people waiting; but it seemed to go by quickly.  I found a seat near the door; and the food was awesome!  I got the jumbo hot dog with relish; mustard and onions with a pickle on the side. Bun was tasty; and I loved it. Price point was right on; and I will gladly drive the few extra miles to go here in the future.  If you haven't gone to Portillo's; you must do so!! Tasty!!  They also have a drive thru here; so if you want to avoid the crowds; or are in a hurry; this is the way to go.  Outdoor seating is available; along with ample parking in a very busy shopping center. Place is visible from the road; but come early because the place is non stop busy!!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"OMG what is this place? And why-oh-why did I discover just as summer in Phoenix is gearing up?  This place is soooo good with amazing customer service. Everything on the menu looks delicious even their salads; but um; so far I haven't \had a chance\"" to try one -- to preoccupied with these delicious hot dogs and ITALIAN BEEF sandwiches.   Food is super fresh and taste really high quality (for fast food). This is actually the only fast food I will eat. So YUMMMY.   Seriously. This place even has a drive-thru.   Most delicious casual lunch/dinner place in the entire North Scottsdale area. A true favorite.""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This place is a ZOO!!!!!!!!!! I'm kind of happy I waited so long after it opened because although it's calmed down greatly; it's still very hectic! Two lines for customers; six registers; everyone yelling; orders being called over a microphone .... it's an interesting experience your first time but those employees have this down pact!  Everything came out tasting fantastic and I was extremely satisfied :)  I had their regular hotdog with everything on it; tried a jumbo chili dog; and shared their cheese fries :),1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Chicago memories from a hot dog and Big Beef  Okay; that lead line sounds horrible; but it's accurate. My wife and I loved Portillo's when we lived in Chicago. Cheap; good eats and an authentic Chicago Dog.  My father-in-law spent decades loving the Italian Beef sandwiches.  Prices are very good for the amount of food.  Truth is there is a lot of hype associated with Portillo's coming to the Phoenix area from folks with Chicago roots.  It's a classic and old-time fave.  Food is yummy and authentic; but nothing remarkable compared to your places with innovative chefs.  Um; it's also not considered health food.  (Just FYI. :o))  The drive thru process may also throw people the first time.  I had forgotten how unusual it is-- order with a person who walks your car to the cashier person who then send you up to the food deliverers.    Regardless; I love that Portillos and Chicago Hamburger Co are here to fill the need for authentic Chi-town fare.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Oh.....My.....Goodness!!! Cheap and greasy and love in a bag.   We ordered ahead to-go (which was recommended by a coworker). When we got there - it was the busiest restuarant I've seen for lunch probably ever. And they were flipping tables quick. The line was fast and efficient.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Growing up in and around the Chicago area; I am ashamed to admit that it took this landmark eatery's expansion to Arizona for me to walk in the door.  The wife and I decided that our Sunday Fun-day wouldn't be complete without a Chicago Dog; Italian Beef and Rings...I should probably mention that we split a Chocolate Cake Shake too.  The employees are very \Chicago\""; filled with personality and attitude; all working for a seemingly competent and well managed organization to boot.  The interior was very clean; it appeared that they have numerous employees who's function it  is to quickly clean up tables as guests pick up their trays to depart.  Many other restaurants come to mind that should take note.  On to the food:  the Hot Dog was; well a Hot Dog.  Delicious in it's own right; but a Hot Dog nonetheless.  One discerning characteristic comes to mind; the poppy seed bun.  Fresh; almost spongy; not soggy.  Italian Beef was the best of recent memory; possibly knocking Mr.Beef (666 N Orleans St; Chicago IL) off of my #1 spot.  Ordered it wet with hot peppers.  Serving was proper; plenty of meat; bread that was moist and retained much of the Au Jus.  Purely Fantastic!  Onion Rings were delicious; not too thick;  the batter is unique in its texture; much crispier than I remember rings typically being.     Chocolate Cake Shake: two things I am not 1) A fan of chocolate 2) A fan of shakes. How can two things that I like so little; taste so good?  A must for all visitors.""",1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This place already has a plethora of reviews so mine really isn't needed but since I'm a hot dog fan I had to say something. The Chicago dog was amazing as expected; all the fixings on a steamed bun! The fries were underwhelming and needed more seasoning. The Chili Cheese Tamale was surprisingly good but you feel guilty with each bite ( I swear that thing has to be a million calories alone and only God knows what they are using as the filler!). The stand out thing here for me is the service. This place has excellent customer service; from the time you walk in till the time you walk out their employees make you feel at home and that's something I really cherish. In this day in age when most establishments are only concerned about your money; Portillo's goes the extra mile to make your overall experience great.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I've never had an Italian beef before my visit to Portillo's. I lived by one in California but I never tried it because I thought it was just hot dogs; but when I saw some of the pictures of the beef sandwiches and read the reviews; I was eager to give it a try. Since this location is right by my work; I finally had a convenient opportunity to give it a shot. We went through the drive-thru and service was crazy on point! It wasn't incredibly busy like I had seen passing by other times; so maybe the 7 staff members standing outside to take orders usually have more to do; but it seemed way overstaffed at that point. The food came out reasonably fast and you could feel the heat of the sandwich intensely through the bag. We decided to share a big beef sandwich; dipped (we love gravy) and with hot peppers; with a side of fries. The sandwich was so juicy it leaked through the bag; so next time ill probably ask them to double bag/wrap it! When we got home we devoured the entire meal with great satisfaction. The sandwich was huge; easily satisfying our hunger. Can't wait to have another; and maybe try a Chicago Style dog; I'm interested in what all the hype is about!,0

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Went to Portillos in Scottsdale yesterday! Jammed parking lot; long lines of people waiting to order! the lady that took my order was friendly and helpfull! very crowded while paying and waiting for my Hotdogs and fries. The assembling of the food was fun to watch!:)) When my order was ready and found my way to table very crowded and the Ketchup was out and my Hotdogs tasty but not very hot! more like luke warm! fries were too salty and not hot but warm and nothing special! Lady manager was understanding and very nice ! Great atmosphere and fun people enjoying the NEW restaurant!! I am looking forward to going back when less crowded and try a different menu item ! Hotdog and fries at Als Beef in Scottsdale were hotter and more tasty!!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,What an experience - that's all I can say after a recent trip to the new Portillo's in Scottsdale!  We decided to brave the crowds on a Saturday afternoon before a spring training game.  Thanks to an early game we got a good start at Portillo's around 11AM; which I think SOMEWHAT helped with the crowds.  Thankfully we found a parking spot quickly and hurried into the line that was already outside the door.  Inside was PACKED and a bit overwhelming for a person who isn't too keen on crowds.  After placing our order one person in our party stayed in line to pay and two of us looked for a seat.  It took a good 10 minutes walking back and forth to finally get a seat.  People were pushing and shoving the whole time - not fun.  Once we finally were sitting and our food was received; we all calmed down and scarfed our food.  I had a hot dog; which was fab.  I really enjoyed it!  The fries were great as well... only wish we would have gotten more!  The Hubs had an italian beef sandwich and we really liked it.  He got it plain and said next time he wants peppers for sure.  We all really enjoyed the food here; though the crowds were CRAZY!  Not sure it will get any better anytime soon; but perhaps in the future when I am brave again we will give this place a second go around.  For now; I will wait to see if the masses die down.... I doubt they will!,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I had the beef dog with Italian beef all on one bun as I understand this is a trademark dish. I wasn't terribly impressed and will likely return to try some different things on the menu. Had good flavorS; I just may have ordered the wrong thing for my taste buds that day.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"\Hot Dog\"" is in the name and I am only going to Review the Hot Dogs.  Here I am going to \""go against the grain\"" with a mediocre Review of a New Restaurant receiving mostly good Reviews.  Okay; so maybe I am a \""Hot Dog Snob\"" from the East Coast; where everyone knows there is only one brand of Hot Dog that can stand up to being boiled instead of grilled. (The \""Dirty Water Dog\"" is the Sabrett brand; in Natural Casing).  In fairness to this new location and because I love Hot Dogs I tried three varieties:                          With everything! (The Chicago way)                          With Mustard and Relish only (My favorite)                           Chile Cheese Dog  Let me say; the \""Toppings\"" are terrific. The problem is with the Hot Dog itself. Far too mild; no beefy taste (Bordering on no taste); overwhelmed by the toppings and with very little \""snap\"" when biting into it.  Probably in the minority; but just NOT as good as the size of the Restaurant and the reputation would indicate.  Ted's is still the \""Hot Dog Of Choice\"" in Phoenix and they are from Buffalo; New York.   Willing to venture to Maricopa for the BEST BOILED HOT DOGS EVER (Sabrett)? If so; go to Al's Dogs located next to O'Reilly Auto Parts on John Wayne in Maricopa. Better call first to be certain they are open: (520) 357-3647""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Only adequate.    There are several better hot dogs in the valley.  See Ted's for a similar priced dog that will blow your mind; or The Main Ingredient Ale House for a top notch \fancy\"" dog.  The beef sandwich is fine; but it's not something to bring me back.  It's kind of fun having a sogged sandwich disintegrate in your mouth like bread thrown to ducks.  But it's also kind of like eating duck-grade bread.  The gravy/jus is flavorful but the meat isn't anything special.  Tender and well prepared but not much to it.  Compared to a good cheesesteak; the beef sandwich lacks character.   Poor onion rings.  Crunchy; yes; but they were all coating; no onion.  Good price to value ratio.  Neat restaurant interior; but it's a zoo.  Friendly staff; fast service at 8PM on a weeknight.""",1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,A throw back dining establishment great food and atmosphere. Casual and fun it is so much more than dogs. I ordered chili dogs and fries.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,After going here for a quick lunch before leaving to the airport; I was amazed at this place. I have never gone here before and I already like it. The way they order makes it quick and easy for everyone. Then; the food. I ordered two beef hot dogs and fries. Absolute heaven. The buns were great and the hot dog overall was delicious. I devoured the fries as well. If you are ever near any Portillo's; go there for your own good!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Ordered the beef & sausage combo received the Italian beef. Disappointed was craving the combo. Still damn good.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,We've eaten in Chicago and had great food; but this place is the worst. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things; but would never go here again.  I got the bbq chicken salad and my husband got the chicken sand. My chicken tasted like a byproduct of hot dog; spam and chicken - absolutely disgusting. I almost hurled. I was so hungry and took the rest of it off the salad just to eat something. The chicken sand felt like a box of air when we took it out of the bag. It was mushy and came with nothing on it. Plus; they wanted $.31 for ranch dressing. You must be kidding me?! The onion rings tasted like frozen rings and the ketchup cups were so small; we couldn't even dip it in anything.  We saw a lot of people got the beef sandwich; and looked good; but will never go here again to even try it. I'll take a bag of Skittles and a Snickers for dinner before I'll visit this place.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Great food; especially the Italian Beef! Make sure you get it with the sweet peppers. Love the onion rings. Atmosphere is very friendly. Service is great and entertaining.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,First time going here was today. I have to say it was amazing. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun.   The only thing I didn't like was the girl that took our order; she was rude.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Food is descent. Surprised by the salad options for a dog and sandwich establishment. The ordering process is a disaster. 5 points of sale with enough room for 3. This start your experience out very poorly and with mediocre food; the place is  worth the trouble.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"First things first:  you go to Portillo's for the Italian beef; hot dog or chocolate cake shake.  If you are not from Chicago; this is something you need to know.  I've read some reviews by people who claim they don't understand the hype - don't order a salad! (Their chop salad is; however; delicious)  You gotta get the beef dipped with sweet peppers.  Some go for cheese; but honestly I think that just takes away from the amazingness of the beef itself.  I guess I'm pretty simple.   A helpful tip to avoid the crazy crowd:  go right when they open!  That's what we did and it was easy breezy and quiet.  Late \breakfast\"" or an early lunch - if you don't want to wait it out in the long lines; get there as early as possible.  We got there at 11am and it was getting pretty crowded by 11:30. It's worth it.  Having a Portillo's here means one less thing on my To-Do list when I go home to visit! Love it!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Portillo's Hot Dogs looks like the love child between a 50's Diner and the Las Vegas Strip.  I don't even like hot dogs but the throngs of people flowing through the doors at noon piqued our curiosity. After some initial disorientation due to the over abundance of signage; we located a paper menu and were pleasantly surprised that most of the menu items were not hotdogs.   I ordered a broiled chicken sandwich and my husband  chose the Italian roast beef sandwich.  My sandwich was fabulous! The bun was super fresh and there was a moist real chicken breast with some lettuce and tomato on it. The Italian sandwich was loaded with meat which had been soaked in a flavourful au jus. The $5 prices seemed like a bargain for them.   The sides of fries and onion rings  were nothing special but the apple walnut chicken salad and the chocolate malt are on my list for our next visit.   Interestingly many of the employees seem to be a couple of generations older than your typical fast food kind of place and they are super friendly and efficient .,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,It's bigger than it looks which is good because apparently every transplanted Chicago resident in the Valley has made this their lunch spot now.  The food was good and served very quickly; but not having been there before its a bit disconcerting to have them ask for your order before you even reach the point where you can read the signs.   Of course; not being from Chicago; I had never heard of Portillo's before this opened and while it was good; it's basically a hot dog and Italian beef sandwich shop. Are they good hot dogs? Sure. Are they worth a long wait in line? If you're not from Chicago; probably not. Will I go back? Probably; but I wouldn't make a special trip.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I've been here twice and will return.  I've only had the hotdogs; so I can't speak to the remaining menu.  The hotdog I had was really good!  I very seldom eat meat; but was craving a good 'ole fashioned hotdog and Portillo's did the trick! It's a busy; chaotic atmosphere; but the service is really fast.  Parking is sometimes a challenge as it's located in a huge shopping area; be careful.......some people aren't very pedestrian aware!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,We're from Chicago and have lived in the valley for over 41 years. During that time we've tried many places to get a good Chicago Italian Beef sandwich. None of them had the right texture; seasoning; moisture to be called a Chicago style sandwich. Today we visited Portillo's and are so happy we did.  We had their Italian Beef sandwich and it was like being back in Chicago. We LOVED it. My husband liked it so much he ordered the Big Beef sandwich to go and had it later this evening at home.  One of their salads made my mouth water so next time I'm going to try that. It's an apple walnut chicken salad. The place is large; airy; a little on the noisy side; quick service; plenty of space and an outside patio. We will be back and I'm sure it'll be multiple times.,0

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"I had this place bookmarked for months before I finally made it. The place was packed and lines were long; which means it must be worth the wait! I felt a little rushed through the ordering process; but they made it work and it was definitely fast service; which was great because I was on a break from a class across the street. Oh yeah; the seating arrangement was a pain though! The place is huge but not big enough for everyone to sit down; causing people to turn to seat vultures; eyeballing you to hurry it up with your meal they don't have to stand there anymore.  Now the food... It was delicious! I had an Italian beef (dipped plus hot peppers) and a bottle of water. My co-worker was kind enough to share her fries with cheese sauce and I only had a few; but let me be honest in saying I could make a meal out of those! Yum. So; I would be back for the fries alone.  Let me tell you why the two stars and why only the cheese fries would get my business. I was soooo sick to my stomach the rest of the day. I could feel the grease from the \gravy\"" sitting in my stomach and was belching the taste through the next day. This is not normal for me and so disgusting! Like I said earlier; it was delicious; however; after that bout I am too scared to give the sandwich another shot.""",1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This was the second time I've eaten from Portillo's and the first time I've been here.  I must say; they have this down to a science.    When I arrived the line started only a few feet inside the door (that's what I get for going there at lunch time).  The drive through line had over 12 cars in it.  At this time I almost abandoned my lunch from here.  I'm glad I didn't.  From walk-in to walk-out was only 15 minutes.  If you never been there; they take the orders at the back of the restaurant.  We were handed a menu when we walked in; as we got close to the register our orders were written onto a bag so all we had to do was hand it to the person at the register.  We were then directed to the pickup counter and given a number.  I can't say how many people we in front of us; it was a lot; but the staff keep things moving.  There was someone at the front calling out numbers ready for pickup and keeping things moving and most importantly keep people from hanging on the counter while they waited; making those getting their food difficult.  She was very pleasant and interjected humor in all the right places.    I will admit that I have waited longer at other so called fast food establishments for lower quality food.  As my daughter and I were picking up lunch for mom/wife; we were only a few minutes behind schedule and this stop made it worth it.  Another couple having lunch near us was in awe that we had brought in Portillo's.  The food was good; the malt was great and lunch was perfect.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Opening week Friday probably not the best time to go; but had to go to Portillo's.  The line from the door outside must have been 50 ft which did not include from the door to the counter. So we went to the drive thru which took about 12 minutes thanks to the staff. Food came out quickly and lived up to the hype. Italian Beef was very good; the Sausage Sandwich was very generous and had to get a Hot Dog to split and try a piece of each. Tried the Chocolate Cake Shake and fries which were all tasty. Will be back to try other items. One thing is when ordering; have all the items with everything the way it is suppose to be.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,A friend and I ran a 5k last night so we decided to indulge in Portillo's for dinner. We made out way over and while it looked busy; there wasn't a long wait to order or pick up our food. I decided to try the beef n cheddar and fries and my friend had a chili dog. Our food was ready after not too long and we grabbed a table and dug in. Unfortunately; the fries and lemonade far outshone the sandwich. It looked and tasted as though it had been preprepared and was sitting in a warmer. It was warm; not hot; and there was little cheddar to be found. My friend was equally unimpressed with his hot dog. For the price though; it wasn't a total rip off. On our way out; I grabbed a chocolate cake shake and he got a strawberry shortcake. Those definitely redeemed our experience and I loved the shake.   Maybe they are experiencing a lack of quality control in the kitchen since opening up? I'll probably try the Tempe location once it opens up but I was less than impressed with my first time here.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"The place is packed. Disorganization is rampant. The hot dogs were tasteless and cold.I honestly think they forgot to cook the hot dog as it was COLD~ not room temperature! ( I was nauseous later that day.)  They had another order mixed with ours so we had extra which we threw out. .Total chaos inside. There are several lines for ordering food; paying the cashier and then everyone waits for the order to be called. It is like a cattle call. There is no orderly flow from one to another. People have to push there way through in order to pick up their order which bottle necks at one point   I can not understand the hype.Positively there is not much to say except they have interesting   menus and atmosphere (signage etc). . In summary; this place has built up an image from its past. Can people be so desperate to wait for mediocre food; crowded conditions and total chaos?  Perhaps not all Portillos are run the same? I would skip this joint. I give it an \F!\"" Unless they clean up their act; I honestly don't see how this place can make it in the long run. I don't think Scottsdale people will in the long run tolerate this substandard establishment. I tried it out of curiosity and hype. Once was plenty. Thank goodness for alka seltzer! Argh!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I am not from Chicago; and I have never been or heard of Portillo's until my boyfriend told me about them.  We made the ride out to Scottsdale because he was craving some crinkle cut cheese fries (which are fantastic!)  He had a beef sandwich which looked phenomenal; and I totally messed up and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich.  My sandwich was good; but a place called Portillo's Hot Dogs; and I get a chicken sandwich?? I can't wait to go back so I can try a hot dog; and do it right.  However; I did get the cheese fries; only regret is that I didn't get a bigger size ;) Service is good; atmosphere is fun; and I love the 50's music they play! The restaurant is absolutely HUGE; and I can't wait to visit the new Tempe location.,1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,The hot dog was good but; really? What's all the hub-bub? I was still hungry when I finished it so that's not a good sign right there. I ordered a chili dog with mustard; ketchup and cheese and onion rings. The onion rings were too breaded and too crispy (yes; there is such a thing as too crispy).   The place is a bit confusing to figure out when you walk in -- need more signage. I'm sure I'll come back here to give them another shot; but I don't see what the big deal is...yet.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,There was so much hype about this place that the bar was set super high; but my first visit was terrible. Had never been here before so my girlfriend and I were standing beyond where the line was looking at the menu. An 'usher'; or whatever they are; jettisoned us (rather rudely also I must say) into the line saying we have to get in line; despite our remarks that we had never been here and didnt know what to order. He insisted so we got in line and within 30 seconds were pushed to the counter. We still had almost no time to look at the menu and we let the employee know that we were pushed through and we weren't ready and then he got frustrated with us. Felt like I was in the twilight zone. Hot dogs are sub-par and disappointing. Luke's of chicago was way better in my opinion. Not allowed to sit at a table and wait unless you have food; must clean up your own plates and throw everything away your self. Not really much a restaurant format. Wonder exactly what I am paying for here; average food and attitude it seems. Gave them 2 more tries and results were similar. Not coming back here.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I was excited to try this place; but I just don't get the hype.  Hot dogs were good; fries good; Italian beef was nothing special.  Service was good; fast; staff very friendly.  Not close to where we live in Phoenix and not worth the special trip; but would eat there again if we were in the area.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I recently went to Portillo's on their opening night at their Scottsdale location and the place was packed! But to my pleasant surprise; the staff handled the crowd exceedingly well managing to get everyone served in a timely manner. When I arrived with my friends; I would say we were probably close to 200th in line; but we still had food on our table in about fifteen minutes. Truly remarkable.   The atmosphere was fun and definitely had a 1960's Chicago feel to it. Even though the place was loaded with people; my group of about eight friends had no trouble finding a place to sit inside; as they provide seating outdoors as well.   The food was pretty good. It was a good hot dog and the fries were pretty solid. I tried the chocolate cake shake... it's not for me but others at my table would swear by it. Only downside to the night was that they messed up couple of our orders; but that's completely understandable given the traffic the place was under.   Overall; good place to eat; fun atmosphere; with meals as little as $5 a plate.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I visited Portillo's after several of my co-workers raved about the place. I probably won't bother going back; like its gaudy decor; it's all shine and little substance.  SERVICE: I'm not a huge fan of the cattle-call style of food service. The organization was pretty lax when I first arrived and we got 'cut' in line several times as groups came in. Eventually an employee came out and started sifting people into appropriate lines.  When it came time to get food; we were back to 'cattle-call' again. The woman calling out the orders was humorous at first; eventually her rhyming and overly-loud microphone just gave me a headache.  FOOD: I had an Italian beef sandwich. The beef was mostly flavorless and somewhat dry; even though I had ordered extra gravy; the cheese was rubbery; but at least it had some flavor from the grease on it.   I tried a bite of a co-worker's hot dog; it wasn't anything special.  AMBIANCE: Can you hear me now? No? Then you might be at Portillo's. The only thing louder than the mishmash of decor is the actual noise level in the building. Don't bother trying to talk here. Including a pair of noise-canceling headphones with each order would be nice.  OVERALL: If you couldn't tell; I didn't really see any positives to the place. The food was mediocre; the style of service is annoying; and the noise level might just be tinnitus-inducing. From now on if I want an Italian beef I'll go to Guido's; and I'll make the trek down to Ted's Hot Dogs in Tempe when I want a good frank.,0

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,If you like burgers that taste like they just came off of dad's backyard grill; then this is the place to go. Never have I found in a restaurant a burger that tasted so similar; but I found it here. And that's the only way I can describe it; really. I can't even remember how the rest of my food tasted; I was so enthralled with the deliciousness of my burger that anything else in front of me was irrelevant. They have a completely separate counter for ordering desserts; so try not to fill up like I did so you can experience that!  My roommate is a Chicago native so as soon as she caught wind of this place we immediately headed over for her to relive memories of her childhood. The place was unbelievably packed - the line was consistently out the door and winding around the dining area - but it was worth the wait. In fact; I have yet to drive by when they aren't seriously busy; but perhaps that is a testament to their food. For the line being so long; it didn't take too long. The decor is retro styled and set up like classic diner-meets-backyard picnic and suited the food they serve there well.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"I don't know what to think of this place. I mean; I really do like it (I'm giving it 4 stars); but it's not what I was expecting. I had heard SO MUCH about Portillo's before going; but despite that I didn't realize it's basically glorified fast food (and I don't mean that in a bad way at all). For some reason I thought it was more like casual dining.  Anyway; I've been here a few times since I recently started going to a new doctor in this area & I've really liked what I've had. I will say; I got things that probably aren't the most popular items; which actually probably speaks to how good this place is (my dad always gets the chili cheese dogs w/grilled onions & LOVES them). I've had the chicken tenders; grilled chicken sandwich; and beef on a croissant; all of which were yummy. I also LOVE the cheese fries. The fries are crinkly & I like that cheese is on the side. I also tried the chocolate cake & brought home the strawberry shortcake on my last visit. The chocolate cake was VERY rich; but it was a huge slice. I really LOVED the Italian style shortcake; though.    This place is a really weird place to dine in at. I do like that they are kind of old school when you place your orders. They write it down as you order and call it out to the back over a microphone before ringing it up. I think this makes for less mistakes; especially on orders that aren't as exactly as the item(s) are on the menu. However; I do wish they had a soda fountain where you could serve yourself. It's nice to grab your drink immediately while waiting for your order (it also makes it easier for refills). They also serve you your food here as if everything is takeout (bagged up) whether your dining in or not. It's not a big deal; but it seems like kind of a waste to bag up food; rather than just place it on a tray if your gonna dine-in.  The few times I've been here have always been late afternoons (right after the lunch crowd); and although things have been pretty busy the wait to order & for food isn't bad. From what I understand though this place gets PACKED at peak hours.   All in all I really like Portillo's; and think it's a good; \different\"" fast food place to stop by and grab a bite to eat at when in this area.""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Starting with the food; it tastes great and I'll go back for it.    That said; I usually order take-out from my car; and way too often they don't get the order right. Today; I ordered a large iced tea with the pink equal; I got neither equal nor a straw. I ordered mustard on my Maxwell Street Polish; missing!  On other occasions; I've ordered the burger with mustard; ketchup; pickle; onion only and gotten lettuce; tomato and mayo; or no onion; or no pickle.  If this kind of sloppy service didn't happen about every other time I go there; I would give them 4 stars.  Come on Portillo's; get your act together!,0

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Virtual applause to you Portillo's for handling the masses so efficiently and smoothly! Word spread like wildfire when Portillo's announced that they were coming to Scottsdale. For months; Valley residents from all around waited anxiously for the doors to open. Just recently; Portillo's doors finally opened. Were they ready for the crowds? Yes they most definitely were!   I've been to Portillo's in Illinois so I knew what I was in for. This Portillo's lives up to its roots. The exterior is bright and welcoming with tables all around. The drive-thru resembles that of an In & Out (in the ordering sense) and the interior reminds me of a 1950's booming diner. Everything is friendly and welcoming about Portillo's; including the staff. I heard that they brought in around 80 Chicago staffers to manage the launch of the Scottsdale opening which was very smart on their part. We visited tonight and although the line was wrapped around the restaurant; we ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. What's their secret? Complete organization. While we were waiting in line; someone came up and took our order so that by the time we got to the register; all we had to do was hand them our ticket and pay. After that; we got a number and waited for them to call it. Within 5-7 minutes; they called our number and we were ready to feast!   The food here is really as tasty as people say it is. It's all about the beef; the Italian beef that is. The beef is juicy; tender and flavorful and sits within a soft roll. The fries are delicious and the Chicago dogs are as good as any. I have yet to try the Chopped Salad or the milkshakes but I hear both are extraordinary so I will be ordering them next time.   All I can say is; believe the hype and pay a visit to Portillo's. It doesn't matter if you've been to one in Illinois or not. Now we have one in Scottsdale and Shea an the 101 is a better place because of it! Welcome to the Valley; Portillo's.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I am a big fan of hot dogs; enough my husband teases me about it. So naturally; when I heard Portillo's was coming to Scottsdale I was excited.   It was strange to me; to see a Resturant MONTHS after opening; with drive through lines across the parking lot; and a VERY VERY full dining room.   We got in line; and I had no idea what I wanted; and didn't have much time to pick because someone with a bag and a pencil pressures you into ordering before you even get to a register. I understand they are trying to speed things up; but when I'm a first timer --- let me look at the menu.   I ended up ordering a Chili Dog.   It was great to have glass between us; and the kitchen. It was exciting to watch everything going on and MAN do they have a LOT of employees. Everything seemed to work like clock work.   I have also decieded my new dream job is to be the girl who calls out the order number!  Number Eight Seven; you're about to be in HEAVEN!  Very clever!   The food was delightful.  I really enjoyed my chili dog; and the french friends were hot and tasty.    I will be returning - but don't rush me!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"An incredibly impressive establishment. The staff goes above and beyond; the food is simple and well made; and the place is clean and classically cute.   As pescetarians; we were a little worried about the quality of fish and veggie items at such a popular carnivore joint - so glad we risked it!!   We ordered the Grilled Tuna sandwich and the Grilled Vegetable sandwich - both great!! These aren't just token non-meat items - they're really tasty!!  The tuna was the perfect drive-thru fish sandwich - tender and yummy; served on a small; fresh bun  (not fried; not gross!!). The veggie was a generous portion on fancy bread - lovely fresh grilled vegetables; Havarti cheese and nothing else! So healthy and tasty!   The people who work here obviously take pride in providing excellent; friendly service. Door greeting; directions; order taking; etc were great; plus an employee held the garbage can open for us! I kept turning to my husband and saying; \wow; how can they all be this nice?\""  We're so excited to find such a tasty; healthy bargain right near our gym!! Feeling like we won the lotto :-)""",1

5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I love their food!!!; they got killer cheese fries and all beef chili dogs!!!!!!; this is the 2nd Portillo's I've been to (I went to the one in Chicago 2 years ago); the service was good here; it gets packed during lunch time here and it's noisy which are cons but their great food makes up for that!!. Bring Portillo's to San Jose please!!!!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I really don't understand what all the hooplaa (a teynical term) is about. We stopped in for a quick lunch with the parents last week and we were less than impressed. We enjoyed what we ordered; but I wouldn't drive more than 5 minutes to eat there.   I had a chopped salad; it was alright; the dressing was good; but too much of it. My hotdog bun was pretty much wet. Everyone said the was because it had been in a steamer or something... if this is what people in Chicago call a good hot dog; they must not get good food often. I guess the Italian Beef is what all the rage was about; but none of us partook in any of the beef sandwiches; maybe we will give it a whirl next time.   I also don't get the drive through right next to the patio like that..... yeah that's just what I want with my sandwich a lung full of exhaust fumes. Awesome!  All in all it was alright foo.... but I wouldn't go out of my way.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,After shopping at Fry's; my husband and I decided to grab dinner at Portillo's. We had never been to a Portillo's previously and wanted to try it.  We contemplated parking and going in or using the drive-thru. We saw several employees standing outside with headsets and such; we were concerned something was wrong with the telecom system that most drive-thru places use. We decided to chance it and use the drive-thru.   When we pulled up; a friendly employee greeted us and asked to take our order. We explained that this was our first time; so she handed us two menus. I decided to get the chili cheese dog and my husband decided on the Maxwell Street Style Polish dog. We both decided on onion rings. The employee told us to drive around and pay at the second window. Again; there were several employees outside waiting to take our money and hand us our food. They were all very friendly so I asked why they were standing outside. Apparently this is what they do! All day; every day - unless it's really busy and not efficient to do so. Call me crazy; but this was totally bizarre to me. It was a very hot day; but AZ can get scorching during the summer. Let's hope they are inside on those days!   Our food was prepared quickly and we took it home to enjoy. My chili cheese dog was really good - everything was flavorful and the bun was soft. I had a bite of my husband's and it was really good too! I couldn't decide which I liked better. The onion rings were good but I probably wouldn't order them again. (They had more bread than onion - the ratio was off.)   Looking through the menu more closely; they have a lot of items to choose from. I'll definately be back to try more!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This place is amazing! The Chicago dogs are amazing; as is Italian beef. Nice; fast service; delicious food; and get this; it's cheaper than the takeout place next to my house! Bottled water is 69¢! Can you believe it! It's cheaper than most fast food places (and the food is a million times better too). Everybody should get to eat here. Oh; and just a quick tip; if you like strawberries; the strawberry shortcake is absolutely to die for.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Whoever runs this place is incredibly good at his or her job.  I've never seen anything like it.  You walk in and there's A TON of people.  You give your order within 2 minutes; pay; and your food is ready 5 minutes later.  And it's delicious.  The only minor issue is it's pretty tough to find a place to sit.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Awesome food and service when there. The staff was very polite; and despite the place being packed on a Sat afternoon; they kept lines moving; and allowed people to get their food quickly.  The Italian Beef def fit the Chicago mold; and was well crafted and flavored. The employees cannot be praised enough for their care of the product and the food.  If you actually care about food; and appreciate quality; and especially if you are from Chicago; Portillo's is a must,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This could be the best beef/sausage combo sandwich I've had in my life.  The food is consistently great; and service is efficient and friendly.  The hot pepper topping is a must; unless you're not into spicy obviously.  Ask for a little extra; it's that good.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Its just about as good as Chicago!!  I'm so glad!  Even the workflow is the same; they take orders before you get to the register and your food is ready in no time.  Its awesome!  PLUS because we're not in Chicago they even have a nice patio area so you can enjoy your food outside!  Pricing's the same too!  SO HAPPY!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I gave into the hype and met some girlfriends at Portillo's the other night for dinner...  Perhaps I had high expectations from both the Yelp reviews I'd read prior and all of my Chicago friends raving about this institution that they grew up frequenting.    Unfortunately; I didn't realize that a few weeks after the grand opening; Portillo's would still be a zoo!  It's huge and lines weren't long; so I can't complain about that; there were just tons of people (both patrons and employees) everywhere you turned.  I didn't love the layout either...  I'm usually all about fast casual concepts and ordering at a window; but I hated that there are three different areas to pick up your food.  It varies depending on if you order salads; hot food; and/or dessert.  And you have to wait for your number to be called and then go pick it up from the appropriate window.  It's hard enough to hear your number being called and then it's tough because you have to leave your group to go get your food; hence; not a relaxing start to a meal...  Amongst my group of three; we had a hotdog; a chicken sandwich (the breaded one on the croissant); a bowl of chilli; a barbecue chicken salad; and two large fries (one with cheese and one without).  We also had a lemonade and several bottles of water.    I will say that prices are very reasonable; and the food was fine -- not amazing though.  I felt like it was a glorified fast food restaurant; nothing to make me rush back; although I am sure I'll eventually make my way back to try some of the other things on the menu.  (The other salads looked good and I hear great things about their desserts).  Again; I wasn't a fan of all of the chaos -- perhaps that will die down eventually?  There were a ton of staff; but none of them were super friendly or helpful.  Guests are supposed to clear their own tables - we learned that when we asked.    Portillo's doesn't offer a kids' menu (although considering the prices; that's fine); and no refills on drinks either.  I think if you go in with expectations for a higher end McDonald's; you'll be pleasantly surprised.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,We were great fans of Portillo's when it first opened; even though there were long lines.  I am from Chicago and appreciated that they brought hometown favorites here to Scottsdale.  Tonight; we ordered one of the Chicago basics to go:  a big; Italian beef sandwich; wet; on a crispy roll with sweet peppers and extra a jus on the side  It came back on a burnt roll; dry; with 3 overcooked pepper slivers that looked like they were from yesterday's leftovers and   a 1/2 full; tiny cup of a jus.  When I called the manager; Peter about the problem; he could not be any more rude; unhelpful and condescending and  finally said we could expect a refund in 7-10 days;    When; after 10 minutes waiting for and talking to him; I asked to talk with his boss; he said Jim had left for the day.  No I'm sorry.  No how can we make this right. No nothing.  My advice:   Stay away from this used to be a good place and go to Spinato's or Vermont Sandwich Company for a great beef sandwich; They understand being gracious to their customers; consistently serve real; quality food; and stand behind what they sell.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Portillo's has been on my list of places to go since it opened and glad I finally went last weekend. I never bothered to read reviews or visit the website and thought it was just a big hot dog joint. How excited can anyone ever get about a hot dog?  After reading some great reviews here; my wife and I made an early lunch run Sunday to try the Italian Beef sandwiches and were both very glad we did. She got hers with the spicy peppers and I went with the sweet peppers ($0.50 extra) and neither option disappointed! The peppers came with just the right amount of juice to soak the meat and roll.  The fries were crinkle cut; crispy and just the right amount of salt. The big plus was for an extra $0.50; you get a side of liquid cheese to dip them in if you're into that.  Onion rings were great too!   There were a lot of other things on the menu I wanted to try but didn't have the room for; so we will definitely add Portillo's to our list of favorite places to eat at since its right down the street.  The only negative is that it's crowded and there is no self service soft drinks :(,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Why is America getting fatter?  Why is Portillo's busy? Answer one question and you probably answer the other.   I stood in a long line; placed my order; endured endless number-calling (\54; your order is ready ...\""); sat on an uncomfortable chair; ate food straight from the wrapper; listened to more relentless number calling; suffered without a cold beer to make everything seem better (no alcohol license!); then dumped a massive amount of waste into the garbage (this place is as green as a polystyrene factory - if the order is not 'to go'; could they not place the food on a plate?!).    My Italian sausage was edible; the fries were OK. My partner's sandwich was disgusting - wet; disintegrating bread. I got home and for several hours my stomach was in shock ... I probably had more salt that night than in the week preceding!   Why; oh why; is this place so popular?  I mean; sure; the competition in the 'hood is Red Robin; Applebees; and Mimi's Cafe - three establishments fighting for the bottom of the barrel spot - but still ... long lines ... for this?!    I am glad to see a good source of employment for the local retirees who work there; but other than that - not for me!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I'm originally from the Chicago suburbs where the Portillo's chain originated. They offer classic Chicago-style hotdogs with all the fixings. Of course; they offer much more; but I've always stuck with the hotdogs. The place was packed the Saturday that I went. But even though I had to search for somewhere to sit and eat; the line to order moved quickly and I got my food just as fast.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Well let me start by saying the location is more than a notion being located right of the Expressway and at the Corner of 90th and Shea. Traffic is going to a nightmare and getting out of there is going to be an even bigger nightmare especially on weekends...you can count on it. However with all of that being said it is definitely worth the trouble. This was the second opening day event I went to today (First being Krispy Kreme which I will review later) and I have to say the owners of this establishment  \NAILED IT\""....wohoooo. I don't miss many things about Chicago during the 10 years I stayed there....but Portillo's was definitely one of them. The chopped salad was in a word DELICIOUS and I was hoping it would be the same way here in AZ. After waiting for a year for this place to open I was not disappointed. The staff was awesome....the drive-thru was fully staffed and not a single person was waiting out there. The outdoor seating is a bit close to the entrance and right next to the drive thru lane so they might want to look into other options with that.  Back to the Chopped Salad.....as I said before just like in Chicago.....they NAILED IT. However the lady that was making them today seem to have trouble with special orders. I ordered 2 chopped salads one with no bacon.....and one with no cheese....she managed to mess that up REALLY. I didn't hold that against her or the establishment because it was opening day...but if it happens in the future they will lose a star on this review. The prices were also dead on and the establishment itself made me feel like I was in Chicago for at least a few minutes anyway. I think the people that moved here from Chicago like myself will be very pleased and for the newbies.....well I think their dining options will change once they visit Portillo's.  Warning....Warning....Warning....to Chili's......Applebee's .....Mimi's Cafe....Quiznos and Culver's......there is a new kid on the Block and it's name is PORTILLO'S....WATCH OUT....WOHOOOO. Eat; Drink; and be Merry my Friends!!!!!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Normally I have enjoyed coming to Portillo's but an old problem I had before surfaced.  I ordered a hotdog with no orders in front of me.  It took more than 5 minutes to make one hotdog.  Again no orders in front of me.  Oh by the way they do not have blue cheese dressing for their salads.  Who does not have blue cheese dressing with 12 salads on the menu?  Pretty poor.  Guess I will have to reconsider coming here in the future.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Woe! Woe; wait just a minute!  Hold onto your hats cowboys/girls; this Portillo's is the real deal!  It's worthiness is much greater than some of the 3 star reviews I'm reading on the Yelp iPad-acus.  I've been here now 3 times (Yes; I missed a checkin for you fact seeking yelp nerds) and this is the Portillo's I've grown to love when traveling to Chicago many time over the years.    This Portillo's reminds me of the one in Dekalb IL.  The decor; shape and  size are very similar.  The food taste just as good as well!  The only thing different are the droves of people trying to go here for a bite to eat all at the same time!!  But don't let that stop you from giving this Portillo's a try!  It's a fantastic place to go for a delicious hot Italian roast beef sandwich dry; dipped or wet!  Their hotdogs are great and so are their salads (believe it or not :-)    If your feeling adventurous and hungry; I must warn you this can NOT be good for your health but it is really tasty good; try their Italian roast beef and grilled sausage with peppers!  OH MY!  It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this; but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload...   The only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food.   In looking forward to going back again real soon.  I hope to see you their!,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"I am writing this as a born-and-bred Chicagoan who used to go to a Portillo's location at least once a week before I relocated to Tempe--it is EXACTLY the same as \back home\"" with 2 exceptions (which I will get to later).  Construction and ambiance--exactly the same.  Burgers and fries--exactly the same.  Milkshakes--exactly the same.  Maxwell Street Polish--EXACTLY THE SAME--thank you God and Dick Portillo for FINALLY bringing a real; bona-fide Maxwell Street Polish (read:  Chicago classic) out here to the desert!    The two exceptions that may put Chicagoans off:  1.) staff is very well-trained; but they are not Chicagoans; don't understand the \""passion\"" of the food; and although they show great potential don't seem to have the same \""write on the bag; move on; pay; and pickup\"" expertise as they do back home.  2.) space-case; self-absorbed Scottsdale patrons who don't know how to order or to KEEP THE PICKUP AREA OPEN AND CLEAR whilst waiting for their food.  For those \""meh\"" reviews by AZ natives--you have NO CONCEPT of a hot dog; Polish sausage; or Italian Beef; and you REALLY need to keep your purportedly-\""expert\"" opinions to yourselves.  Ted's is NY style--so there is no comparison.  Other locations here in Phoenix--not the same.  PS to the dipstick who said this is a \""chain\"" restaurant--it is NOT.  Dick Portillo and family are the sole owners (and will always keep it this way) and visit each location multiple times per year to ensure that every \""branch\"" is just as good as the original.  As for them being \""sure to fail unless the food quality improves;\"" the food is the SAME as it is in Chicago; and to the best of my knowledge no Portillo's location has ever failed since Dick first opened shop in the 1960's.  So you might want to do a little research (and actually be from Chicago) before you run off at the yap with your idiotic opinions.  Bottom line:  Chicagoans--go and shed a tear of joy as you have a taste of home.  Smug Non-Chicagoans who have never been to Chi-town and have no clue as to what you are talking about--shut the F up.""",1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Was excited about the hot dog experience considering the reviews however the hot dogs were below average. We ordered the signature original hot dog and it was not good; I much prefer the Costco hot dog hands down. The only reason I would even consider going back is because their onion rings were phenomenal. One of the best I've ever had. Chili fries were also decent. However considering they specialize in hot dogs; I think they are in no comparison to what I'm used to back home (Seattle).,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Cue Gershwin's \Rhapsody in Blue\""; because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!  For most Chicago food lovers; Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes; there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply; the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.  This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night; it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me; there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.    As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside; and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy; satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.  I was ordering for three; since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself; I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy; did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck; I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me.   Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half; was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good; but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait; everything was delicious.  The other items on my family's order; were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each; another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09); along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95; including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said; I goofed and over ordered by a mile!  Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95; or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19; and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different; they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.  In Yelp-ese; a Four Star experience is \""Yay! I'm a fan.\""  A Five Star is \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\""  Before tonight; I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon; they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.  Enjoy!""",0

As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside; and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy; satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.  I was ordering for three; since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself; I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy; did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck; I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me.   Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half; was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good; but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait; everything was delicious.  The other items on my family's order; were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each; another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09); along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95; including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said; I goofed and over ordered by a mile!  Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95; or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19; and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different; they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.  In Yelp-ese; a Four Star experience is \""Yay! I'm a fan.\""  A Five Star is \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\""  Before tonight; I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon; they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.  Enjoy!""",0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This place is the BEST! All the food is great! We always get the big beef and split it because its huge! The chocolate cake shake is sooo good! We love the service and environment here! Totally worth the drive! Friendly staff and clean eating areas! We love portillos!!!,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Ever since they opened this location; we've been coming here regularly. We usually order same things but sometimes we try different things here and there. And so far everything has been really tasty. Italian beef is delicious; onion rings are crunch; and crinkle fries are just perfectly seasoned. Tried a strawberry malt it's really really delicious. Their chocolate cake is the bomb too.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I have not been to Chicago therefore have not had authentic Chicago food but I had a great experience at Portillo's today I had seen on Facebook a ton of my friends posting about it and such so I thought I'd give it a go  IT WAS SUPER PACKED It made me a little more excited because since its packed then they must be doing something right :) The line was long but Im very patient so that didnt bother me at all I didnt know what to get but a friend recommended the Italian Beef so  I ordered the Italian Beef with hot peppers; fries; and a strawberry milkshake Oh; I got the sandwich dipped as well  All of it was delicious and I will for sure go back  I will try the cheese fries and a hot dog next time :),0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This is the place to take people who claim to dislike hot dogs.  It is impossible to dislike a Portillo's hot dog. Every time I am in Scottsdale; I get Portillo's multiple times; usually first thing after I arrive and as a last meal before leaving. I have never had a bad experience there--staff are friendly; service is fast; and food is exceptional. I would highly recommend to any meat eaters.,1
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,To be honest; the place isn't all it's cracked up to be; and for a few reasons.   1. Everyone here (and by everyone I mean the customers) are SO bitter! Probably because they have to wait in a 30 minute crowd standing shoulder to shoulder with strangers; but seriously. Everyone is so grumpy and has such an attitude! Normal people turn into vultures hunting and pecking for tables; a spot at the ketchup dispensers; or at the registers and do whatever it takes to get what they want; even at the expense of other diners. It makes the experience a little less pleasant.   2. The whole place seems to lack organization. Not that the restaurant is dirty or disheveled; but the way it is set up doesn't make sense; considering the high volume of people it gets. The line literally wraps around the dining area; and makes it virtually impossible for people to get inside the area where the tables are to find seating. Also; the restaurant is divided into sections. A salad area; a place to order your sandwiches; hot dogs; etc; and then a dessert area. Why can't you just order all at once without having to navigate through crowds of people?  3. The food is just okay. In our party; we ordered the Italian beef sandwich with roasted peppers and mozzarella; a hamburger; side of chicken tenders; cheese fries and regular fries. The sandwich was apparently decent. Not the best my boyfriend has had; but definitely not the worst. The hamburger was also good; but then again; they're not a hamburger joint; and how hard is it to mess up a hamburger. The chicken tenders were something like what you'd find at a Safeway deli. This doesn't mean that they were bad-- they were just average. Not to mention; one of the chicken tenders in the box (each box is a 4-piece) was about the size of a McDonald's chicken nugget; if not smaller. The one thing that caught me was the two orders of fries.. With the cheese fries; you get a normal order of fries with a cup of fake nacho cheese-esque sauce; that you're supposed to dip your fries in or whatever. I would have definitely preferred a cheese that was either melted on top or that had a bit more flavor. And the fries themselves; by looks and taste; were somewhat like the crinkle-cut fries that you'd find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.   Regardless; they still have a really cute atmosphere/decor: that of a 50's/60's Chicago-style diner; and their staff seems to know most of what they're doing. I would go back because their prices are great ($3.65 for a decent-sized burger); but it would be under the conditions that 1. the weather is nice because it's a 50/50 chance that you'll be sitting outside; and 2. that I have a solid hour; hour and a half to blow considering the line to order and the wait to get your food and then find a table.   Anyhow; to sum it up: not great; not terrible. Just average.,0
5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I've come here often and always had good food and service. Except for today. My order was wrong. No big deal I walk up they offer to fix it I say ok. 15 minutes later no food. I walk up again and the guy asked if I had received my food. I said no so he went and had them make it again. They did. I get back to my table and the food is wrong again. Then when I walk back up the girl tells me I asked for different hotdogs. I asked for what I ordered and what was on my receipt. No one apologized. I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs.   What made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right. All I got was grief from the employees for their mistakes. Sad to say but I'll never go back.,0

Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Customer service here is pretty good. Good for an early or late lunch; but beware the busy times!,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Love their chicken strips and the buffalo sauce.  and their waffle fries!!! Super delicious!!! The customer service is always fantastic!!! So courteous and friendly!!!,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,I love all Chickfila due to the good food; quickness and the professionalism. This store was very low on the professionalism. Their microphones were overlapping on voices.I pulled up and when I told them they had a problem with the headsets Putting through two voices they just looked at me. Ok that's fine but then the girl with the brown braided head band was more interested in gossiping than my order. Had to ask for sauces (chickfilas everywhere else always ask first) and then I had to interrupt her mid gossip to remind her to get ketchup. They didn't even say thanks our bye. So rude. Never again!,0
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,"I should begin by stating; I love Chick-Fil-A.  I love the food; I love the soup; I love the family owned concept.  However...  I have never seen such poor customer service.  On duty was  a manager and a team leader.  There were; when we arrived; six people in the front and I could see four in the back.  By the time we had our order taken; we counted eight people up front.   Yet; no one was taking orders.  There were four chit-chatting to the side; a manager counting money...they were doing everything but assisting customers.  We waited as next in line for more than ten minutes; and my husband finally asked \Can you please wait on us?\""  I don't expect perfect; but really; with that many;  people up front; someone should be able to ask if we want fries with that.""",0

Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Great chicken sandwiches and fries. Best lemonade in town. Politics aside; one mean chicken sandwich thats hard to beat. Some of the best customer service in the industry. Great family atmosphere.,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,For a fast food place this one is a top pick to go to. It has everything chicken and tastes so good. I've eaten the Asian salad with honey sesame dressing; the chicken biscuit; the chicken egg & cheese on sunflower multigrain bagel; chick fil a deluxe chicken sandwich; their classic chicken sandwich. All of them were definitely meant to be how it is sold as. Crispy chicken and tender. Smells appetizing.   I like that they have the drive thru lines alternating style so the orders can be taken as it comes and in queue. Except for one time that I went the employee had a hard time hearing me to the point that someone who came after me on the other line got their order first while I was still ordering mine! And the other customer was confused as to why I was still ordering and didn't move forward in the drive thru line. Ha! If she only knew.... :/  I wish they were open on Sundays but I respect the resting day! :),0
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Ahhh! I'm addicted to Chick-Fil-A!!!  I finally tried this place after hearing so many good things and I'm hooked. The first week I tried it.. I think I had it 4 times. haha. (Kinda embarrassing to say :X)   I usually get the spicy chicken sandwich with all the fixin's and eat it with chick fil a sauce and buffalo. mmmmmm. The chicken is a huge piece and it's fried perfect! (Actually one time; it was way overdone. I let them know and they immediately cooked me a fresh one. I hope it didn't have spit in it; although they are so friendly and nice I doubt they would do something like that... or would they?)  The crisscut fries are soooo good. You can tell the oil they fry it in is fresh. They give you great service; it's clean and nice; they give you great extras; and they have community family events. Just feels like a wholesome place to be. :),1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,"Excuse me; I didn't order this \doggie bag.\""  I'd always been a fan of Chick-Fil-A.  That is; until my recent visit.  I placed a drive thru order and waited my turn in line behind another vehicle ahead of me.  That vehicle had it's windows rolled down and two (cute!) dogs were in the back seat with their snouts peering out the window.  It seems the drive thru attendant couldn't resist their charms; reached out and allowed at least one of the dogs to lick the palm of her hand; undoubtedly smearing saliva.  When my turn at the window arrived; I was certain the drive thru attendant would first wash her hands before serving me; but that never occurred.  Please don't misunderstand.  I; myself; am a pet owner and love my furry friend.  In my own home I am always sure to wash my hands before touching food; utensils; kitchen surfaces; etc.  I was dumbfounded when I was expected to pay someone else for something I would not allow myself to do.  In the interest of full disclosure; the drive thru attendant did not prepare my food; but she did handle the packaging it came in which; in turn; I also needed to handle to have access to the food.  All I could think about was cross contamination.  Had I not been in a hurry; I would have brought this to the manager's attention instead of throwing away food which may have been very good under other circumstances.""",0
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Their food is good; and the sides are good.     Now; on to the big 3:  Price:  Pretty typical; and non-effective in correcting the high prices of fast food.  A single diner can expect to pay $8-11 to eat one meal.  I'm guessing that no energy is expended to correct the high prices of one dinner meal.  Service:  Everyone I've talked to has been pleasant; and smiling; if even on an only-superficial basis.  Taste:  The chicken items taste just like chicken.  It's everything you would expect.  Nothing fantastic.  In Summation:  They close as early as 9pm; and ALSO on every Sunday.,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,"Drive thru was Daytona fast!   Friday; just before 1:00pm; dreading the inevitable wait in line; but hold on a minute--is that two order lanes at the drive-thru?? Yes!  Seven cars ahead of me? Ugggh. So much for 2-lane efficiency. I'll check-in on Yelp to bide my time. \Who's honking at me?? Oh.\""  There is a two-car gap between me and the next car. Flash a guilty smile through the rear-view and a quick wave . . . no smile from that dude. \""Wonder what Yelp fans think of this locale. . . ?\"" Another honk? A look to the rear view and then to my front. \""What the hell?\""  The girl in the drive thru window is literally leaning her head out the window; dangling my bag of chow in her hand as to say; \""Come on Big Guy; you can do it!\"" I crap you negative; the drive thru took about 120 secs from green-to-checkered flag on a busy Friday at lunchtime. Impressive and appreciated!!!  Oh yeah . . . my chicken sammie and iced tea?? YUMMAY!!!!  I love Chick-fil-a . . .   Cheers! RS""",0
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Awesome food and excellent service in a fun family oriented environment.  Love this place.,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,I'm always pleasantly surprised with the service and quality of food. The sand which I was served actually looked exactly like the one in the picture. The store is always clean and the napkin/sauce station is always stocked. I feel like I don't have to mention that the staff is always professional and pleasant. If you've been you probably know exactly what I'm talking about. It's probably just me; but everyone I order I ask about any sauces or toppings they might out on and I always forget that they are naturally made exactly the way I like it. I really should go more often. That's all.,1

This location brought your order to your table; removed your tray and were just all around great! I even heard \my pleasure\"" when another customer asked for a refill. The staff member; Eric;  took the cup; refilled it and returned to the customer's table; smiling the whole time!  Both the young men working the dining area were polite and helpful.  The food was great too!  My son and I shared nuggets and waffle fries.  Okay he didn't share the waffle fries to much; I think I got one or two.  It was a great time for my son and I!""",1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,I love it!. Always fresh and hot. Nice customer service with manners! And they NEVER forget my mint!,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,"My fave fast food restaurant. Its yummy; quick and service is extremely friendly.   Some items I enjoy...   The chicken:   Chicken Nuggets (w Chick Fil A sauce)  Grilled Chicken Sandwich (ask for the honey roasted BBQ sauce to go w)  Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe w Pepper jack Cheese   for breakfast:   Chicken Minis! (yummy honey glazed mini biscuits w a chkn nugget in each)  Spicy Chicken Biscuit (new item; already had it twice... it's good)   *I like how it is an actual honking piece of chicken for their chicken sandwich and not a mushed up chicken patty w fillers. They pressure cook their chicken; I believe; and it's always moist and juicy. Their nuggets are chunks of chicken meat; also. Their are tons of sauce to choose from... (BBQ; Ranch; Buffalo; Honey Mustard; Polynesian; Chick Fil A; and maybe a few more). Their spicy chicken is seasoned nicely and actually has a good spicy flavor; but not overly spicy.   The sides.   Their waffle fries are bomb. Never overly salty. Side salads has lettuce; carrots; cheese; tomatoes and broccoli and come with croutons and sunflower seeds.   Dessert:   Thick flavorful milkshakes. Ice Dream (soft served vanilla ice cream); and Nut Brownies (can also get it a la mode w some Ice Dream on top).   They have lots of tasty options here. Service is friendly and fast. If I'm running behind and need to pick up a quick lunch; I roll through the drive through (which is like once a week; hehe).   So save the cows... \Eat Mo' Chik N\""""",1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,The grilled chicken and berries salad is delicious. I know its a chain but this place does it right. Service is always impecable and the food is consistenly good. Waffle Fries are amazing as well.,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Last week we stopped on a Thursday and got free breakfast entrees. In addition; we ordered a side of fruit. I decided to save the fruit; and held onto it until Friday. I was quite surprised to see mold on the strawberries. Yuck! Fortunately for me; I held onto my receipt and politely took the bad fruit to the establishment where I'd purchased it. Please note; that this is NOT the reason for this poor review. We stopped for breakfast again and sat in the drive-thru line for every bit of 8 mins; though it seemed liked 20.   Why hold up the line for someone's missing waffle fries/tater tots? Why can't they pull to the side and have their meals brought out when ready? Sort of like their nameless neighbor on the East side of the building (eh'em!). There no apologies; no explanation or anything. I find it completely unacceptable to have customers waiting that long; but in the early am commute? Seriously? Who does that? Then; to top it off; we get 15 miles away to find that the key piece to those biscuit chicken bites is no where to be found. No honey! Even after it was confirmed that there was some in the bag. Argh!  The ONLY thing that Chick fil a can get me right now is a strawberry milkshake.,0
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Overall a pretty decent fast food joint. The chicken sandwiches are always hot;  but fries are hit or miss. Service is always overally friendly (count how many times you can get them to say my pleasure for a good laugh) but never rude and always relatively quick. Ample parking but the lot itself is a bit of a cluster.,1
Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,This has to be my favorite fast food joint! I love love love their chicken! I always get their number 1 meal. It's their basic chicken sandwich with the world famous waffle fries. The customer service that you get their is stellar!  Oh; and they have the best sweet tea ever!,1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,"Jersey Mike's is; in my opinion; as good as it gets.  Yes; they have the whole \it all started in 1956 as a family business at the Jersey Shore\"" thing going for it (you know; before MTV and a half-dozen wannabe D-Listers made anything connected to the Jersey Shore look bad); and they also do a lot for charity; both at the corporate level; and a little closer to home; on the franchise level.  And all that's well and good; but it wouldn't mean anything if the food sucked; right?  No worries there- I've not had a bad sandwich there.  The bread is fresh; as are all of the other ingredients; and it's all sliced fresh when you order it.  It's not like Subway; where they put a slice of meat and a slice of cheese on the sandwiches; they pile it on.  Cold subs; hot subs; wraps- I've enjoyed all of the sandwiches I've tried- not something I can say about some other sandwich shops I've been to.  If I had to pick a couple of favorites; I'd say the #6 (Roast Beef) and the Chicken Caesar wrap.  One nit to pick- I with there were a 3/4 size; sometimes the 'regular' isn't big enough; but the 'giant' is too big.  The parking at this particular location can be a bit challenging at times because it's small and a little tight; but the sandwiches are worth it.  And the Starbucks next door usually has marble loaf in their display case!""",0
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,For a fast sandwich place this place is absolutely the best!!  Fresh; plentiful toppings (easy on the oil though)! They slice the meat fresh; super friendly service and I love the Mrs Vickies kettle chips too. My only complaint: they sometimes have stale iced tea which is just laziness or lack of a structured opening/closing plan.,1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,Jersey Mike's didn't make me weak in the knees but it is clean; efficient and friendly.  The menu is a little difficult to read for a first timer; so the zig zag lane where you order your food made me feel a little rushed. I went at lunch time and it was packed. The mini sub is what should really be called a regular.  The regular is quite large and the other size is enough for three people. The club had plenty of meat on it. It was difficult to tell the difference between the white and wheat sub rolls; but they were not bad. The most interesting thing was the cups the drinks come in.  There are several different cups with the stories of various Jersey Mike's that have done fund raising for feel good causes. I want to believe this is true because we all like to think we are patronizing do-gooder companies. It may just be branding; I haven't had a chance to really check it out yet. I would go back; but I want to try something spicier next time.,0
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,This Jersey Mikes is alway good. There service is great. They are very nice. This location does a great at job at making you feel like a regular there and they appreciate you as a customer. Highly recommended.,1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,Jersey Mike's when they first opened this location they gave the company I work for a bunch of free sub coupons... I ordered the #56 Big Kahuna Cheese Steak on wheat bread (Grilled onions and peppers plus mushrooms; jalapenos and extra cheese)...  I have not looked back this is one of the best cheese steaks I have ever had in Arizona it's a must try for cheese steak lovers.,0
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,We could tell this was a new place as soon as we walked in the door. There were only a few customers and the restaurant was spotless. Overstaffed by about three people and all were very energetic and very welcoming. We ordered our food and sat down to wait. A few minutes later they called our name and we grabbed our food. My Buffalo Chicken Wrap was really good; at least to those of us that like wing sauce and blue cheese dressing. Yum! I also appreciated the fact that they offered a wheat tortilla and I didn't have to ask. My BF got a Chipotle Cheesesteak and said it was pretty good too. The prices were reasonable. This could be a good place if they can keep up the momentum. I will surely be going back to give it another try.,1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,Fresh sliced meat; and sandwiches made to order. This place may not have all the bells and whistles of some of the big chain sandwich places; but for the money; the quality can't be beat.,0
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,I was driving back to my friends house that I'm dog sitting for; and saw that they opened a Jersey Mikes here.  I've eaten at Jersey Mikes before; just not this location.  I really liked this place.  They have great hours; are open late and have a nice variety of subs to choose from.  They come in a few different sizes; and are made to your liking.  The gal that helped me was really friendly and helpful; and was able to carry on a conversation while she placed my order.    I ended up going with the famous mikes; which was turkey; roast beef and all the fixings.  Quite tasty!  I will gladly return!,1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,These guys make a pretty good sub. It's a lot better than most of the other sub options around; especially the large chains. The service here is always fast and friendly. Their bread is good and meat sliced fresh. Mike's way is the way to go with your toppings...good stuff.,1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,The #9 is my favorite. I love how they slice the meat for every order. Mikes way is the way to go. I been going to Jersey since I lived in California I'm glad I found one close to home and work. Friendly service and they get your order right every time.,1

ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,"I am not a big sub sandwich eater.  I've tried many of them - Subway; Quizno's; Jason's Deli; Eegee's......etc.   Besides Eegee's (which is really good); I just thought they were all decent sandwiches - some better than others.  But I have had Jersey Mike's a handful of times now; and their sandwiches are much better than the others.  Just get it \Mike's Way\"" and enjoy the tasty food you receive.  But just as importantly; the customer service I have received at this store has been impeccable.  The people are always very friendly and patient and that makes a huge difference to me.    I must say that their sandwiches are a little pricier than others.  I get their \""Giant\"" size (ok - so I'm a big eater....) at it runs about 12 bucks...yikes!   But as delicious as it is; it's worth it.  Try it - you won't be sorry...""",1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,"Mike's is set up like your typical sub shop where you can order it the way you  like it with...... a bonus of Cheese Steak Sandwiches; made hot on their flat top right then and there!  I have to say they rate much higher in quality over most of the other shops I've visited and I feel they give you plenty of your meat of choice; no need to double/pay up. Their Giant sub is much bigger than a \foot long\"" I can get 4 meals out of it personally.  I have to say the staff is a cut above the other shops also.  Their friendly and clean cut young adults; way to go Mike!""",1
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,Great sub style sandwiches; deli sliced right when ordered.  Good cheesesteaks too.  I like to get giant sizes and make two meals of it.,0
ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,I usually go just for the salad bar which I think is totally worth it. I decided to order a sandwich and was completely disappointed because it was soaked and soggie. It was a hot sandwich so it probably sat on the plate for a while before they sent it to our table.,0
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Decided to come here for lunch today...back on the low carb kick so I went with some lettuce wrapped Double Doubles.  They really do hook up the lettuce here in the lettuce wrap.  These burgers had like 6 extra lettuce leaves wrapped around them.  I just discarded them to the side and chowed down.  The burgers were great as always.  Hot; fresh; inexpensive and delicious.  Service was friendly although a little weird.  The girl at the register wouldn't really look me in the face.  She kept peering over my shoulder like she was talking with the person behind me (even though there was nobody behind me).  Can she see ghosts?  Fucking rad if she can!  It wasn't a lazy eye either.  It was just a bit odd.  At least she got my semi unorthodox order correct the first time (lettuce wrap; no tomato; no spread; both kinds of onions).  This place is 1 mile from work so I'm sure I will be back.  Can't really beat In N Out!,1

EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Nothing different at this location.  Still great service in a nice location off the freeway.  Will definitely be back when we crave the best simple burger; fries; and shake in the world!,1
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,"My husband drove to this In-N-Out Burger a few years before as part of an epic life-search journey (think Harold and Kumar go to White Castle--but driving from Minnesota to Arizona). Needless to say; when we realized we'd be close to the \In-N-Out Burger that started it all\""; we had to stop by.   Twice.   All in all; great service; good food; very clean; and relatively quick (they make everything as you order it). I had one of my Double-Doubles with raw onions and one with fried onions (do the latter of the two). Highly recommend!""",1

EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,"CHEESE AND RICE!!!!  If you only make 3 muhfuggin things; you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well; by golly!  The burger was only a buck-69; sure; but it was dinky; and it wasn't going to matter *how* I used it; there just wasn't enough meat. [insert joke about how \I'm not used to that\"" here...bahdumbump]  GOT DOWN SAT ON A BENCH!!!!!  I sat as the first car in the drive through; after having paid and gotten my drink; for literally 8 minutes; knowing full well that I'd only ordered a single burger and fries; wondering what the creative curses the poor folks behind me were hurling at me for thinking that I'd ordered the whole store. Sure; it was 12:30-ish; but I watched about ten orders go out the front counter in this time.  Again; no exaggeration.   If the orders were in fact being passed out in turn; and the inside counter had gotten that backed up; that's a pretty sad thing. Finally the food...  fuh-DANG-ah!!!!!!!       Dem buns was greeeezy!!!  I first noticed that the inner wrapping paper had acheived that completely see-through window effect that Dr Nick recommended Homer look for as his ticket to gaining enough weight to achieve Disability status.    I unfolded the drippy paper to find that I could literally squeeze drips of grease out of the bun like a saturated sponge; but only on one half; mind you!  The other half of the bun had edges that were hard enough to warrant 'bird-food status' for any bread product in my household.  The one napkin I'd been given was useless; since it had been purposely draped over the french fries; presumably to keep them warm(?)  Luckily; I had a stash in the car....of NAPKINS; silly.    `;8^}     I will say; since I found that slimy thing and the cool limp fries that went with it inedible; that the girl inside was quick to offer my refund; but also quick to make it clear that she wasn't really listening to any of the comments I was providing; but instead was chosing to blow me off as Mr Angry Customer.    I guess I had already shown my cards by letting slip a comment similar to:  \""If you only make 3 muhfuggin things; you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well; by golly!\""  (but not verbatim~ahem~)""",0
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Love the chain; hate the poor slow service at this location. Why do I have to wait 13 minutes for 5 cars in front of me? Drive through isn't intended to be a parking spot. Mgmt needs to wake up!!,0
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,"Mmm..I LOVE me some In-N-Out! Yes; the menu is small; but the burgers are huge and the prices are a steal. I can walk out with a double-double cheeseburger; animal; protein style (don't judge; I'm pregnant!) for less than $3.50...and I won't even finish it.   I'm stoked they changed their 'cash only' policy...as that was always a pain in the ass. They also use fresh ingredients; never frozen beef; and they cut their own fries.   I don't eat fast food; and I would highly disagree that In-N-Out be classified as typical \fast food\"". Do you see Burger King or McD's using only the freshest ingredients and cooking everything to order?""",0
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,I'm a fan of this location and In-N-Out in general. The fries are better at this location than the other one I used to go to. The last couple times I have been here; the girl at the counter has been a little confused by my order. Everything came out right in the end though.,0
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Did I miss something or what? My son brought me here for a late lunch after a Dbacks game. Passed on Chinese which I regret now. We purchased 2 doubles; a single; 3 FF's animal style and 2 large drinks to go. Total...$23 and change! I got the single thinking it would be enough for me. My mouth was watering thinking about a nice thick juicy burger. Wrong! The only thing juicy was the lettuce and tomatoes. I opened the burger to discover a 3 1/2 inch diameter; thin wafer of meat; dry as a bone. Some parts I could actually see through. It was thinner than McD's. 1/8th pounder? I couldn't even taste it. I think you need to order the triple to taste the meat. By the time we got home (5 min.) the cheese on the FF's congealed into one big glob. I ate it cause I was still hungry after the burger. I ate it like a potato pancake. It was unappealing but tasted OK. My son liked his meal?  I would go to BK's; McD's or Pete's any day of the week at 1/3 the price. Sorry son!,0
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,My 21 year old grandson who lives with my wife & I along with My 14 year old grandson who spent the night while my wife is in the hospital for a knee replacement. After leaving the hospital around 7pm we stopped at In-N-Out Burger for a quick dinner. I normally detest fast food; but I don't even think In-N-Out truly belongs in that category.  A lot of people would say In-N-Out is overrated but they are good. They have a very limited menu of get a load of this; all they have is burgers; fries and a few beverages to wash them down.    FOOD: Cooked fresh; our burgers came out hot. They weren't sitting under a heat lamp like some places. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. For a fast food burger the flavor can't be beat. FYI: I'm NOT a fan of their fries. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: The service was fast and they were really nice. CONCLUSION: I don't know what the secret  is.  Chances are you can make a better burger at home; but at the same time there is just something about In-N-Out burgers that makes them  delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection! This In N Out is on it! They're at the top of their game to handle soooooooooooo many people and still produce such top notch food!,1
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Overall - 3 stars...burgers are okay - fries are fresh cut and pretty good.....  Two words - ANIMAL STYLE!! Now that's a burger! 5-Stars for the animal style double double!! that's the only burger I will order here!   Everything else is good to fair for the price...,0
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Love me some In n Out...so; I live in a state devoid of this great burger establishment so I always enjoy an opportunity to stop in and blow my calorie consumption for the day.  Upside is consistency; customer service; freshness and fun...love it animal style. Onions by request but plenty which I love...  It can often be a bit sketchy to find a seat but be patient; generally by the time your food is ready someone has finished and moved on.,1
EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,I drove compeltely out of my way for an In-N-Out burger last night.  I freakin love that place.  I have to say; I have been eating at In-N-Out since I was a teen in LA.  It will always be my favorite.  I want to tell you that the 20 years ( God I am getting old) that I have been eating at In-N-Out I have never tried animal style.  I never wanted to screw up what I thought was the best.  I ordered animal style for the first time.  I seriously am in love.  I kind of feel like I wasted the last 20 years of In-N-Out eating on plain old cheeseburgers; when I could of had ANIMAL style! What was I thinking LOL.  If you have never tried Animal style; jump out the box and do it!  it is worth it!,0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,I wouldn't normally review a chain restaurant; but this one is literally around the corner from me. In the year or so since they've opened this location; I've always received friendly; speedy; good service & my orders have been spot on!   Great location too; there's a self serve frozen yogurt place down the sidewalk for dessert & other foodie places if your friends all don't agree on one place to eat :)   The bowls & soft tacos are my personal favorites.,1

5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,YUM!!!!  This is by FAR one of our families FAVORITE Chipotle stores.  The food here is always awesome and super fresh.  Now; I know everyone knows the food is spectacular and fresh; but what they may not realize is how great and friendly the staff is; especially Casey who helped us out this last time we were in.   Also; I have to admit that I hate waiting in line (since who can resist this place) so we always order online; drive to the store and walk straight to the counter and never have to wait.  Nothing better than an inexpensive; high quality meal with no clean up!  Thanks!,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,Fastest chipotle I have ever been to! I live closer to the one by metro center mall but the service is so slow that I have stopped going as often.  This chipotle is fast; courteous; and they didn't skimp on the guacamole.,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,This location is the worst Chipotle I've been to. I place online orders often and they are very rarely ready on time. Today I arrived 15 minutes AFTER the pick-up time I chose and it still wasn't ready. They also forgot part of my order. I only ever order steak and when I go to this location my bowl is almost always full of fatty steak pieces.  Very much looking forward to the location at 27th Ave and Deer Valley opening soon.,0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,Today I went to chipotle I even called in advance to see if they were open. I waited outside for about 5 minutes I was the first guest in line I ordered my usual salad. Then when it came to check out a very nice young lady who was the manger that morning told me she was sorry for any inconvenience and that she will take care of my lunch today it was very nice! They will always have my business because their is always excellent customer service,1

5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,"Completely uncommon for me to rate Chipotle low; but tonight's food service and prep of the rice & beans was horrible resulting in a very poor tasting meal.   Note; just last week I rated this same Chipotle 4 stars and it was deserved; but tonight makes me think this place is VERY INCONSISTENT.  I was third in a line of four people; not a very busy time at all.  Server was in a rush; a inexcusable whirling tizzy and she didn't steam my burrito well; gave me half portions of rice; black beans and chicken.  It sat there next to the guy in front of me who had ordered the exact same thing and mine was embarassingly small compared to his.  It was blatantly obvious how skimpy mine was as the two sat next to each other.  She was in such a flustered rush that after passing mine from her station to \topping guy\"" and then not seeing it immediately move as it was queued up behind the guy in front that she returned to move both 6 more inches as if that would get things out of her sight.  It didn't; but who cares if it takes a few more minutes?  Besides a lack of flavors; the textures were affected too.  When I received mine the tortilla hadn't been steamed well meaning it was thick and cold rather than the typical warm and soft texture.  The Cilantro rice is usually a highlight but dimished and completely lacked flavor.  Black beans were nearly missing so their normally sweet flavor was semi-absent and the cold; thick tortilla dough dominated the flavors of this Burrito. Many of the tables were dirty and hadn't been cleaned in a while.  Sorry I stopped by.   You want to see the service staff that made this such a bad experience; look at the photo I posted.""",0

5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,So I read the reviews and as usual I don't pay too much attention to them because I like to make my own judgment on a place based on my experience so with that said I went in to the restaurant at 9:40 pm which is 20 minutes till close but they had over 12 employees working at what seemed full throttle which is typical for young folks trying to get off and out on a Friday night. I have to add that Chipotle is one of my favorite places to get food and having children and bills it's almost a treat to have being that for only me and my girlfriend it was 21 dollars. I got to the restaurant and there was a line. Usually a line for Chipotle but always moves fast I ordered 2 burritos; chicken for my girl and steak for me so as he was making my burrito I asked for half barbocoa and half steak he asked if I wanted double meat or just half and half and I said half and half. Well the barbocoa pan was full of meat so he gave me a tong full and the steak pan had less than a big spoon full literally 5 little pieces of steak and rather than get something fresh from what they were cooking behind him he passed my burrito off to the next stage of the burrito making phase and as i stood there looking at the 2 burritos with the meat on the rice my girls burrito had almost triple the meat mine had so rather than be a jerk and make a complaint I just asked for double meat which the guy from the next phase of the burrito making he grabbed a heaping cup full of meat. The little cups they usually put the salsa or other sides in and it was what the amount was for being a single meat burrito I asked him to go light on the hot salsa because let's face it that stuff can melt the paint off of a car if you tried. Lol but the guy put a whole ladle full. I just shook my head to which he didn't notice and started wrapping my burrito after placing the other ingredients I asked for in it. So final stage of the transaction of the burrito making production line the cash register guy asked if I wanted some chips or anything else. I love the lime salted chips and of course said yes. I didn't notice the size of the chips till I got home and to a great disappointment the chips were hardly filled to the bottom of the letters of the bag where it says Chipotle.  Which you get more if you buy a 1.49 bag from the store. So very disappointing and to have payed 21 dollars for food that was poorly put together and skimped on for chips and meat  which I had to pay double just to get what I should have gotten for the single meat price mind you; also the non existing bag of chip's. I will make sure they never get my hard earned money ever again. How could such an amazing chain become so non amazing over the last few years? For me I know that I won't be going back to this location or any of their locations which is terrible because of this experience and I truly hope my review reaches out and makes someone think twice before they go overpaying for poor food and poor service at Chipotle.

5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,Food is good but this location has terrible slow service going back to since they first opened. Go to the metro center location instead  Address is wrong on yelp; its near 7th street,0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,If you're looking for a man; this should be your next destination. Men love this place. (A coworker of mine met her fiance eating lunch here and now lives in Tampa; so if you're in the market for a burrito and a cross-country move; you might want to give it a try.)  My favorite? I love the spicy Barbacoa soft tacos (3 per order); in which they use shredded beef braised for hours and saturated with tastiness. Their meat is all naturally raised; if that's important to you. C'mon; not a fan of injected hormones in your meat? Pfffff. But; in all seriousness: the toppings are fresh; crunchy and delicious. Go fajita style; if you're so inclined; the carmelized onions and sauteed peppers are tasty. Tip: If you're a burrito type of guy (or; less likely statistically; girl); they come standard with rice. If you're not a fan of starch; ask them to skip it.,0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,I would not normally spend time reviewing a chain restaurant like this but  I had to after the service I received there this past weekend. My husband and I ordered online before heading over there. We asked for our salsa on the side and were a little bummed when we got there and it was actually on our items. The cashier was very accomodating and quickly had our order remade and gave us a free drink while we waited. He also gave us extra free chips with our remade order. We were very happy with the customer service at this location!,1

5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,THIS is one of my fav places in all of PHX.  I eat here about twice a week and they know me!  I love the staff and the quality.  When you tell them you are Gluten Free they immediately take off their gloves; wash their hands and put on new gloves.  They then change out each utensil in the dishes you want to have and then make your bowl or tacos to order.    At this location they are all very cool about it and don't make you feel like you are a pain in the patooty for doing it either!  They always smile and have a good time while they wait on you and IF your to go order isn't ready?  They've always given me a free drink while I wait.    Many restaurants could learn a thing or two from seeing this crew work!  Even when busy (and they almost ALWAYS are) they make you feel important!,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,Quality food and quality service ! The workers are always in a giddy mood laughing and smiling. The carnitas burrito is always on point (what i always get) and the vibe at this location sets the mood just right cashier always greets with a smile and tells me to have a nice night (they should wear nametags) i recommend this location !,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,This Chipotle location is awful. Being a huge fan of this chain; I know how things should be better than most of the staff - only because I have been going since most of them were in elementary school.   Service was awful. It took forever to get through the line because the employees just don't listen and don't pay attention well enough. The shift lead; or whoever the heck it was bouncing around was completely flustered (probably because he saw how awful it was at that moment) and was rude to me. I could barely get a tray for my food without him letting out a loud sigh.   The food was not up to par either. The steak was fatty and chewy; the chicken rubbery. The folded the burrito weird so the sour cream and cheese was at one end and everything else on the other.   It was a bad experience; and I wont be back to this location.,0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,I placed my order online. Got home and my burrito was made wrong. I called back to let them know and they said just come back in. I informed her that I need my steak well done. It was not done well done by the time I got there so I had to wait ten minutes. As soon as I walked up I asked to speak to the manager...the girl at the front desk says she already told Management what had happened. So; I asked for the Manager again. The Manager finally comes out and I express to them that if I ask for a Manager I should be given a Manager. I also expressed my poor experience and how customers should be acknowledged by Management if there is a problem. This particular Manager didn't care so I asked for a refund and I will not be going back to Chipotle (ANY location) until customer service practices have improved.,0

5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,"Normally I love chipotle and get good service at the Zocallo Plaza store. But tonight I came in to this store and the one girl couldn't figure out how to make 1 cheese & 1 steak quesadilla or seemed like she didn't want to make it & asked a guy who was just getting off work (end of shift) to do it. Then the mngr told him he had to go but I got my two quesadillas; chips and guacs; made it to the register and the cashier dumps all the food in 1 small bag! 2 nice chilled guacs thrown upside down on top of 2 hot quesadillas with a bag of chips on top! So here's what really got me: I asked for a larger bag and was told \the manager does not allow these to be given out unless you are buying at least two salads or bigger/more items\""! Really??? I spent $14.51 and I am refused a larger bag??? The cashier was not budging; repeated her manager wouldn't allow it - I even offered to purchase the damn larger bag! So then I requested & got a 2nd small bag which I transferred the 2 cold guacs & chips into myself! Chipotle; you need to get a grip on your franchise operations - stores like this bring your rep waaaaay down! I won't be back here EVER!""",0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,This location was pretty good. They were packed but still managed to get our order right. I would say they were adequately staffed for the lunch rush (line was about 10 people when we arrived).,1

This location had most of these bases covered; but feel a little short on others.   So; let's \Oreo\"" sandwich this review (good; bad; good). They had a line when we arrived; even though it was 8:30 p.m.; but they moved it quickly and with purpose. The staff was nice when arrived to the front and it was our turn to order.  I had carnitas tacos; as per my usual; topped with mild; cheese and sour cream. I thought it was a bit odd that they put my tacos into the burrito bowl instead of the usual plastic basket; but hey; a carrier is a carrier. The carnitas was completely cold...not luke warm...but cold. Still edible and tasted okay; but not what I was wanting or expecting.   The main seating area was a bit chaotic and messy; but like I said earlier; it was busy and they had a decent sized line; so turn around on tables was probably just behind and playing catch up.   The overall restaurant was clean as a whole though; if you didn't count the tables needed a little TLC and before we left; the line died down and they were making a visible effort to touch the place up from the rush; so yay!  Overall: B Not my best Chipotle visit; but not a loss by any means. \""A-OK\""""",1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,Have had 3 bad experiences at this location. One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online; then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling. They are extremely conservative with all of their burrito making. Would not recommend going to this location.,0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,The slowest chipotle by far; be ready to wait ...  It was Saturday evening and the place was packed!!! The line was going out the door. I am used to long lines at Chipotle; but they usually move pretty fast. People who work there are always very quick and on top of their tasks. Well not the case here. I understand that work area needs to be cleaned and more food ordered; but when you have 20 people waiting in line forever you have to move. My bf walked over to Paradise Bakery; waited in line there; had his sandwich prepared; walked back and still waited about 5-8 minutes with me. Only I I wasn't that hungry; no way I would wait that long,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,We go here at least once a week. It's always crowded but timing is everything..we try to get there with the busy time has died down a bit. Always clean; and always great service.,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,We love Chipotle in general; but this is the location we most often go to.  Friendly efficient service even when very busy and awesome food! Can't beat it!,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,They're very fast at this location and I haven't had a bad experience yet. They do a great job and the staff is very nice. I go around lunch time and you know they can have a line all the way to the door but I'm out in 10 minutes with multiple orders for the office.,1
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,Expect to wait a minimum of 15 minutes before your order is taken. The lines are always very long.  I suppose that means they are doing well.  I go here fairly often and I notice that the staff seems to turn over a lot.  Perhaps this is just typical of a fast food joint.   The food is delicious every time.  It's really really flavorful so I hope you like spice!  The food is quality and taste is always consistent and the staff is always nice.    One thing that bothers me is the inconsistency among my orders.  I usually get the kids taco meal. Sometimes they give me 2 tacos and sometimes they give me one.  Sometimes the meat is on the side sometimes not.  I honestly don't know which one is right so I never correct them.  It just seems odd to me that there is so much confusion on how to prepare one of very few menu options.,0
5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,Only my second time at a Chipotle. I haven't quite figured out why they are so popular. But the food is good nonetheless.  This location is clean. Very modern. The staff was courteous. Plenty of seating.  I was meeting my son for lunch around noon. There was a line; but it moved quickly.  I ordered a salad. Okay. Romaine in a bowl. Did I want beans? No. I added veggies; salsa; and sofritos?? Soy. The soy was good. I love meat; but was watching calories; and the sofritos were a low calorie option. I added some Pico and was good to go.  They do have an online nutritional counter if you need to figure out calories. I was happy with what I got; and it tasted very good! Would definitely go back!!,1
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,The food at Chipotle is amazing of course!  But... There is always a line at this location because of how slow they make the food. They do skimp on the portions and seeing other people complain about it on here just reaffirms my suspicions.   The workers have been courteous in my experiences... they just don't give a lot of meat.  ALSO; the online ordering really slows the process down. I waited a long time while online orders were being made. Get rid of this online ordering; Chipotle. This is ruining your customer service.,1

lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,"I love*d* Chipotle until today. I waiting in line for 15 minutes. I got up the nice burrito-ista took my order and then she gave me the finger. Not the middle finger but the index finger. She told me to wait a minute as she pulled an online order off the wall and started putting together their order. Why did my time and money just suddenly lack importance? Do they really think customers won't be put-off by this process? Do they think at all about how this process would make their customer feel unappreciated? I say give a guy in the back a station to make online orders. Let the people with enough gumption to go into the restaurant actually place their order without getting \bumped\"" by someone who isn't even there.""",0
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,This location has always gone above and beyond for me.  I have Celiac Disease and cannot ingest gluten.  Not only do they know their menu well (all of them) to steer me in the right direction; they follow the corporate guidelines for gluten intolerance perfectly including changing gloves; spoons; containers; washing hands; wiping down the line; etc.  They go out of their way to make sure you feel safe eating there.  What I especially like is they don't make you feel like a pain like sometimes other locations and restaurants can.  For some reason; them seem to understand that my need for them to follow protocol is a serious thing related to my health which I appreciate.  Even when I order online; the manager reviews often times what they've done or notes that they did follow gf procedures which gives that extra piece of mind.  I've been there many times especially when busy and I appreciate when one of the staff recognize me or my order which makes me feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer.  I have written tot he corporate office regarding their inconsistent gf protocol in each store (which is still better than the average restaurant and their understanding of gluten free) and mentioned that this location goes above and beyond and should be used as a model location.  I appreciate all they do!,1
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,I would never visit this location again.   There meat portions are horrible. It is like they are being paid to skimp on the meat serving. Each time I have gone; you have to order double meat just to get a full scoop.   I like Chipotle; and this is convenient for me which is why I have gone; but after this most recent visit I will drive to a different location even if it is further for more quality.  Also; they are always backed up with a long line.  I would recommend the Alma School location. They are fast; food is much better portioned; and staff has always been friendly.,1
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,awesome place to eat. I come here regularly on my lunch break in the service is always friendly I recommend asking them to 'mix it up' for you once your burro is done they mix it all up before wrapping it :),1
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,"Yes I've experienced better Chipotles. This location is always busy so when we order lunch for the office we fill out the fax sheet. Kinda hard to screw that up but somehow they did. My co-worker crossed out both squares for the beans; which clearly means NO BEANS. Well she got both black and pinto beans. She also complained that she didnt get enough meat.   My order wasnt screwed up but about halfway through my bowl I kept asking myself  \where the f is the meat.\"" After digging some more there was still barely any meat.   We have eaten at that location several times and although the food is always good; they often times manage to screw something up. Never big screw ups but something is always off.   No complains about the Alma School and Queen Creek location.  Pluses: Nice location; liquor license!""",0
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,"This is the worst Chipotle location ever.   Lines are always out the door... And I've never seen a line move so slow in my life. No joke; plan to wait around 30 minutes. There are 3 reasons for this:  1. The employees are slow... And don't listen. I can't tell you how many times I've either had to have them remake my order entirely due to a lack of communication or add sides because they only put on a teaspoon of hot sauce.  2. Not sure why people don't use the online ordering. In the land of Mormons (aka Gilbert); this would really make a difference in the line... One person will be ahead of you placing 10 orders they are reading off their phone.   3. Samples. \Can I try the chicken?\"" Who the hell needs to sample chicken?! I mean really; people. Get yourselves together.   You're much better off going to the Chipotle location on Gilbert between Ray and Warner.""",0
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,Came on here to see whether I was crazy or if other people were experiencing the same two things: really slow service and very small portions. Yes and yes; it seems like.   This has to be the slowest Chipotle in the nation... I will drive out of my way to go to other locations just to avoid the cashier who is there at night and wants to have really awkward conversations with EVERYONE in line. I even tried to be on my phone one time so I could avoid it.   If you need to finish a book; head over to Chipotle and wait in line. You'll have the time to read that and maybe another.,0
lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,I absolutely love Chipotle and in the past this location has been fine but tonight was awful.  My boyfriend decided to order online which seemed like a great idea except when he got home I realized something wasn't right about my burrito before I even opened it up.  It was misshapen and even though I just removed half the foil the burrito just fell apart. It's like the contents were trying to escape the tortilla. So I gave up and tried to eat it with a fork when I realized the meat wasn't fully cooked; as in tasted raw in the center of those tiny pieces (of which the burrito was seriously lacking). While my boyfriend's dinner seemed fine; he also commented that something didn't taste quite right.    Do I have to watch you make my food to get a decent burrito?  I've worked in fast food and just because someone calls in an order it doesn't mean you get to be lazy.,0
p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,"IF YOU LOVE CHIPOTLE LIKE I DO; DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION. By far the worst chipotle location that I've ever visited. I ordered 3 Barbacoa tacos and the guy put a TINY bit of meat; when I asked for more he said \oh you want double meat?\"" No! I don't want double meat; I want enough meat to call it a damn taco. I asked for corn salsa; sour cream and cheese and I got sour cream and guacamole. Now;  I'm not complaining about the guac but I guess the cheese and corn salsa weren't important. The \""double meat\"" sucked too. It didn't taste like other chipotle locations. The best part was the man scratching his crotch in the kitchen and then coming to \""supervise\"" the good line.""",0
p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,This chipotle sucks! The staff here is extremely rude! Perhaps because this location is ran by careless teenagers who obviously don't want to be there. They gave me attitude when i told them they forgot to put rice in my burrito and asked them nicely if they can put some in it. They were also looking at the lady in front of me like she was stupid when she would ask about the menu. The steak was gross. It was tough and I felt like I was chewing on rubber bands. I will not be returning here ever again. Horrible experience all around. The management needs to look into their evening employees' work ethic and lack of customer service.,0
p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,I  went to Chipotle this past Saturday 11/15/14. I ordered the bowl with brown rice; black beans and steak. The steak was as tough as leather and my teeth couldn't break it down. The steak was also bland in taste and overall my food was warm; not hot. I did not  have a good food experience at this Chipotle and I will not be back.,0
p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,Good food and service. They moved us through quickly considering the line was out the door. The only bummer is that the chips were a bit stale. The food here is great and it's a go-to lunch spot.,1
p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,Been here multiple times. Had bad service; small portions and messed up orders multiple times. They forgot to put salsa in my last pickup order. Seriously? How do you forget that? Last time I go here. Lesson learned. This Chipotle sucks.,0

p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,If you haven't tried this place you had to try it at least once. They have the best ingredients for all their food and some healthy options as well.

p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,"love; love; love this place. I crave their food! I've a vegetarian and love the fact that I can get wholesome food made to order. And I love the fact that they serve \thoughtful\"" food.""",0
kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,Why do I continue to come back here?  Because its the only place open to get an ice cream float. Consistently wrong orders even when asked to repeat the order back. Daytime is a little better with about 50 percent success. After 9 pm; no shot.   What is the name of the district manager please? Uh; uh; you mean the store manager?  No. We don't have one. Left messages for the store manager twice. No callback. Filled out the 10 minute survey- no feedback. Your products are not horrible but your service is the worst. Step it up guys.,0

kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,"It's been a while since I've eaten at a Sonic.  What drew me in was a coupon in the mail for 2 for 1 premium Hot Dogs.  They have a new menu of premium Hot Dogs and they looked very tempting; so I grabbed my coupon and headed for this location.  I decided to order:  Chicago Hot Dog http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=aQgi3VN_Cj_GKf6BsuD8CA New York Hot Dog http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=3vkk0sdl_Fv-soALmxy0lg Cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=xefpZG1PaZqwR9msB56xiw  Since I'm a big fan of Chicago Dogs; I went for the Chicago Hot Dog first.  Based on it's appearance; it looked promising.....except the Relish wasn't colored Car Coolant Green like the real Dogs in Chicago.  I took a bite and was pleased.....it was \close\""; very close to a real Chicago Dog.  Next up was the New York Dog.  It was OK; not as good as the Chicago Dog.  The Burger was OK too......better than most fast food joints.  The one weird thing about this restaurant location is that if you decide to dine inside; you order through a phone and someone from the back brings it out to you.....strange; very strange.  Overall; not a bad fast food option.  Will come back for the Dogs again.  Gave it 4 Stars.....was really rounding up from 3.5.  Return Factor - 77%""",0
kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,"Really disappointed in the experience I had tonight. I come here often and happened to be driving by with a car full of people.

And yes we verified the time on our cellphones.  Pulled up to the speaker and was refused service because the computer locks at midnight. I've worked a POS system before and it does not refuse service especially when it wasn't even midnight yet. When questioned; the employee was incredible rude to us.

kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,The people that work there dont care about their job at all. I'm Pregnant so at 8 pm when happy hour comes my boyfriend and I like to go get a shake and malt. Every time I go through the drive through I always ask politely to put extra malt in. But it seems the one guy shaun is the only one who seems to understand when I ask for extra malt I mean extra malt. I am now to my point of not even coming to sonic to get anything since the employees dont Care. The other thing that makes me crazy is when we get the receipt they put on it that they charged me for the exrtra malt but we still dont get extra malt. Customer service is semi okay some of the girls need to stop being braty and except the fact that they work at sonic.,0
kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,For the  first time; after many a visits; I went here and it was very disappointing.First; I only live a half a block away and my food was cold when I got home.I am talking less then 5 minutes; hello MCFLy!! I was up-sold a corn dog for a dollar and it was cold and over cooked. The fries were a greasy mess and the chicken strips were almost hard as a rock. The gal that took my order could care less that I was customer; pretty sad. I use to always go there- and loved the food-  and this is my last time for awhile. I took the online survey at www.talktosonic.com and my review was not a good one. I will not be recommending this specific Sonic to anyone anytime soon.  How can a fast food drive thru get it so wrong?. I man really people.,0
kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,Tried them for the very first time yesterday afternoon.  Aside from not knowing that you paid the young kid standing outside w/your treats; I think I did okay. I ordered a single cheeseburger with all the fixin's and a small soda. Burger were pretty tasty! They could have gone a little lighter w/the mayo; but overall - not too shabby!  I've heard rave reviews on their tots as well - can't wait to try these puppies some other day. Oh; and all of their slushies and shakes.,0
kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,Sonic always has what I'm looking for late at night: Sonic Blasts and Limeades.  I'm not a big fast food fan; but when I'm in the mood for it; Sonic can satisfy.  The service is fine; and the line is never too long.,1

kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,Ya know; it's Sonic.  They've some decent prices (wishing they had more dollar items myself; but hey....) and their food is often decent to good.

ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Don't order the turkey burger!!!!  Mine was smaller than advertised; machine processed rather than hand for;med and tasteless.,0
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,We went in here tonight. We weren't really hungry so we were gunna split a burger. We ordered the baby burger and it was incredibly small. We had to go buy another. Its overpriced in my opinion. The fries were alright. I like crispy fries so I was disappointed. The burgers were good but they better have been for what we paid for them. My wallet is still angry with me.,0
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Located in Tempe on Mill Ave next to ASU; I would never have found this location.  However; a Groupon brought me here.  Since I love Fatburger; I couldn't resist.  I ordered a Dbacks Double Cheeseburger combo meal which included Skinny Fries and a Med Drink for $10.29. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fatburger-tempe-2?select=vL82qa-aXQzv-vRpL31tLw#vL82qa-aXQzv-vRpL31tLw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fatburger-tempe-2?select=vSRn9_Ir5QPyjtC02et9sQ#vSRn9_Ir5QPyjtC02et9sQ  If you've never been to a Fatburger before; it takes a while for them to prepare the Burger because they make it fresh.  The food is awesome.  The Burger is huge and juicy....full of flavor.  I left stuffed and satisfied.  Return Factor - 70%,0
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Compared to other burgers this place falls way short; sadly i was disappointed! It's just a greasy pile of mess. If you want a burger that has great flavor and the toppings feel fresh then try on the other choices on Mill. The fries had very little seasoning and were just not appetizing compared to other joints. Honestly i wanted to give the place 1 star but felt that was too low and i like to reserve those for places with really bad food and really bad service. The service was good here they greeted you as you walked in and left.,1
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Disgusting.  I would never eat here again.  Gary and I went to Mill on Sunday.  We wanted to go to the bookstore and to try someplace new.   When we walked in; he said; let's go; I don't want to eat here.  But I said; no; let's give it a chance; it's always packed on the weekends.    I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings...  they were out of onion rings and lettuce... so I ended up with a cheeseburger and cheese fries.  Gary had the Bacon; egg and cheese sandwich and chilli cheese fries.   We got our food; the hamburger bun was old; stale; rock hard... which pretty much ruined the whole sandwich.  The cheese on my cheese fries was not melted.  They forgot the tomato in Gary's sandwich.  The guy at the counter didn't understand English and I couldn't understand him; so ordering was quite the complicated procedure.    A few hours later my stomach was hurting so much.  I thought I was going to die... and spent the night throwing up.  I will never eat here again; and I may even listen to Gary when he says let's go some place else.,0
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,This was my first time eating here and the experience was alright. The employees were nice and prompt to take my order. I ordered it to go and was disappointed when I got back to work and noticed they had put everything on my Chicken Sandwich when I had asked for it plain. It wasn't a big deal scrapping off the lettuce but it's always annoying having to fix your food before you eat it. They had 50's music playing and the decorations were in the same vein although it didn't really have the overall 50's diner feel I think they were going for. All in all; I still enjoyed my food and will probably go back to this place in the future.,1
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Wow. I've never been to such a slow fatburger. I ordered a burger and fries - no one in line; and 1 burger in process ahead of me; and it took more than 30 minutes. I don't think the cook was aware you can start another order while one was on the grill.   The quality was standard Fatburger - it's a chain.   Don't come unless you have lots of time.,0
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,As far as burgers go; this is my absolute favorite place to go. I love the fact that the burgers are made fresh and ginormous! Then order the fat fries (or you can choose shoestring or curly) and you are eating in true American fashion. Don't worry if you don't eat beef they do offer a turkey burger that will keep you coming back. The shakes are an amazing must have and not to mention beer as well. You will leave this placed stuffed for about $11 per person that's including drink; so if you want to go cheap; tasty and all American; go to Fat Burger their amazing,0
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Very friendly; good service. The food was excellent and will be going back. Great selection of burgers and made the way you want it.,1
ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Ive been here twice... in the same week.(guilty....)   the first time i walked in and it smelt heavenly!! i could smell the grills smoking away :)   i love the retro interior... the silver and white tables and walls... i guess us blondes just like shiny things... who knows...   i ordered a regular burger and a drink... the service was quick and orderly... i liked that there was a lot of room for people to wait and for those of us already seated don't have to have butts in our faces while we try to eat... that's a perk for sure...   the location isn't to bad either... and like i said its huge for being a burger joint on such a busy street....   the Second time i went i had the turkey burger.... it was AMAZING!!!!!!!  it didn't make me feel like i wished i hadn't .... it tasted in some ways better... and my favorite part of these delicious burgers is that they put RELISH on them as well and PICKLES!!!!! yum!!!!   if i could... i would so eat here everyday.... mmmmmmmmmmmmm   ::drooling::,0

byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,What can i say about this place that you don't already know about? It's always clean; always busy because our entire neighborhood comes here everyday. And maybe the most impressive thing about this place besides the food and the customer service is that i haven't seen one person a day over 21 running the place,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,I've tried this burger and fries plenty of times. Still not that exciting... Burger is good but you can have the fries. Service is always friendly.,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,love this place. burgers are awesome. fries are somewhat greasy which is somewhat gross but ill still eat them. love how they have a secret menu and every time i order something off the secret menu the employees know what im talking about and dont look at me like i just made something stupid up. could be bigger inside and have more seating. the fries come with a good amount of salt on them so adding more salt probably isnt a good idea. like how when it gets busy an employee comes out to each car in the drive through line waiting and takes your order. place can get crowded during lunch and dinner time so come early or later for lunch if you dont want to wait forever for your meal. like how in the drive through area you can see inside the building and watch the employees make the food.,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"I used to love this location and now I don't really like it. The inside is nice and clean and the employees are nice but there could be more seating since it usually is always busy. The lines inside and through the drive through are usually long so be prepared to wait. They never used to mess up orders and now all the sudden they messed up a order of mine (Which I don't know how they did since it's common sense.) I went through the drive through and ordered a protein style hamburger (hamburger wrapped in lettuce instead of on bread) and they gave me a hamburger after I had left. I was mad but I was just going to eat the hamburger and not the bread. Well; when I get home my so called \protein style\"" hamburger was only lettuce and tomatoes on a bun..... There so called \""trained\"" employees obviously don't know what a protein style hamburger is! When I had clearly asked for a hamburger in lettuce! Seriously he person that made my meal was a total idiot! Really in n out? Really? I was really mad since I payed for it and it wasn't even what I wanted so I ended up throwing my whole meal away.""",1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,I have been to many of the In and Out Burgers in the valley; so this review isn't about this particular location.  Having been to so many I can't help but be impressed by the superior service received at every visit.  We are always greeted by a friendly cashier.  Service is quick; staff are fast to wipe tables and make sure the floors are clean.  If the drive-thru line is getting long then they send someone out to your car to take your order to help the process go a little more quickly.  And last; but not least; the food is always great!  Great burgers with fresh veggies that are always awesome!   I love In and Out and the fact that I can always count on a great experience!,1

byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"LOVE this place -- they do an amazing job. Ate here twice last weekend. Saw on the web that they have a new \secret menu\"" out; but I just ordered my standard #1.""",0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,My Husband Loves In- N-Out Burgers; I like them; but not my favorite; until I found out about their special ordered Animal Burger; and found out today; that they have yellow Hot Peppers; I had asked them years ago; if they had jalepeno's; and was told no; and wasn't told that they had yellow peppers; Wow !!!  What a difference the peppers make on my burgers; now I like it just as much as my Husband !!!,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Just tried this place a few months back.... had no clue you could order the burgers different ways.  Now... I'm good to go! LOL  Give them a try if you haven't been... the fires are cut fresh... the staff are friendly... it's a good burger... of course... animal style!   Hatch,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Same good quality; same great taste; same great service.... oh how I love you!,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"Amazingly; you can actually get a veggie burger here - just order a \grilled cheese\"" with whatever toppings you want on it.  Otherwise; I was just along for the ride with some coworkers when we arrived a little early for our conference and were looking for a place to eat.""",0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Last weekend I went to In-N-Out burger. I have heard rumors that this local burger joint was delightful. My team and I walked into it with high expectations. While I was standing in line; I took great observation of my surroundings. I noticed a few details that I wasn't very fond of. First of all; the menu only had three burgers that you could order. Altogether the menu only contained a total of around 10 items. I looked thoroughly at the menu and chose my order. I ordered the Double-Double with a vanilla milkshake. Since my whole soccer team of 18 people ordered; it took a long time to get our food. While I was waiting for my food my friends were telling me about how great the food was. When I got my order; it looked like any other burger. When I sat down and took my first bite; it tingled my taste buds and definitely lived up to the hype.,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Love the food; especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily; never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time; so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Didn't think there was too much to say about a fast food restaurant but recently after I left the drive thru I realized they fave me the wrong drink. When I called the # on my receipt; it went to a call center   and she wanted to send me a certificate for free burger; fries and a drink for my inconvenience. Then a week later; I actually got a call to make sure I got my certificate! Now that's great customer service!,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Every location of In-n-Out Burger I've ever visited in AZ and CA has been the same: shockingly efficient; Stepford-like teenagers politely fulfilling my desires for meat and potatoes. The food is also always good. The burgers seem like they are actually made of meat instead of mystery fillers. The fries are crispy but not in an unnatural way.   Make sure you are aware of the not-so-secret menu. I usually get a burger protein-style; animal-style; with mustard instead of spread. They get it right every time. Just went there yesterday with out of town family guests and they love the place; too. It is a priority whenever they visit.   The location at Desert Ridge can get kind of busy; but they always get you through the drive-through line surprisingly quickly. I opt for drive-through when the place is busy; as it seems faster than when you order inside. Plus I am not a fan of smelling the ketchup-permeated air that fills the restaurant. Americans. We love our freaking ketchup.,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,On the way to an afternoon conference with a coworker; we decided to make a convenient turn into the parking lot of In-N-Out to grab a quick bite (he had never had In-N-Out and I couldn't let him leave without trying it). We each got our burgers (animal style) and fries; sat down; and devoured everything.   I'm not a fast food kinda gal; and I never order burgers anywhere- unless they are known for them- these burgers are some of the best! Everything is homemade here; down the the hand cut fries; so don't expect to get your food before the blink of an eye (like you might at the golden arches).   Learn from others and order the burger animal style (grilled onions; special spread; etc.) or protein style (lettuce instead of a bun)!,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"Note: My rating assumes that you are a beef-loving carnivore - steer clear otherwise.  Having never lived in a state in which In-N-Out operates; I always take the chance to visit whenever fate reasonably regularly leads me to Arizona or California.  Bible verses printed on their serving paper materials (which are thankfully unobtrusive) aside; I am all for this place. They pay their workers better than other fast food places and make everything fresh; and granted my experience is limited; but even though it may take a while to get my order; I've never had communication difficulties or an actually unpleasant cashier and I'm sure there's a correlation there somewhere.  The fries are shoestring style and salty; if you like heartier fries; stay away. The burgers are great with grilled onions (found in the \Animal Style\"" but can be requested otherwise.)   A word of warning that may not be stated clearly by In-N-Out's disciples - the burgers are thin; which puts off my parents who grew up on and strongly prefer half-pound burgers; but even they can appreciate the sub-$1 coffee.  That said; choices are pretty limited if you're vegetarian or don't eat beef; and the menu is very small. They do what they do very well; but it's not for everyone.""",0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Not really a fan of fast food but I like their fries and milkshakes. Also love that they are open late. I come here when Five Guys is closed. Lines are usually long but they move fast. Service is nice. I've never had them mess up on my order.,1

byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"In n Out has never disappointed me (after I found out about \fries well done\"" that is...). For those who just don't understand the hype; it's very simple. Fresh; high quality ingredients. Doesn't taste frozen because it isn't (even the buns; cheese and veggies taste much better than other cheap eating options). The service is outstanding; probably because they pay more than other fast food joints. Now; I will say that the food is very good taken home or back to the office; but to truly experience it's greatness; it should be eaten immediately at the restaurant or in your car in the parking lot (so the toasted bun and everything else is crisp vs. soggy). It really makes a huge difference!""",1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,I gotta say this is my favorite in N out location. I come here often maybe once a week. Great customer service;  this place tends to get busy but their still very nice and fast.  My fries are always perfect never overdone like at other locations; it's very clean. And They always acknowledge my daughter and bring her stickers which she loves.,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,This was everything I ever imagined it would be and more.  Being from the east coast; In-N-Out was always simply an unfulfilled dream; so when we booked our trip to Phoenix; we were beyond excited that there was a location mere seconds away from our resort.   We hadn't even unpacked our bags when we ventured on over; and we are so glad we did!  This particular location has amazing staff and service!   Everyone was kind; knowledgeable; and fun.  Our food was obviously great.  You truly cannot go wrong.  I'm not a fan of fast food whatsoever; but I have made an exception for In-N-Out; and would do so again in a heartbeat.  In fact; I did - two more times while in Phoenix!,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Delicious burgers but why don't they indicate on the menu what you can get on them?I don't like guessing what kind of toppings are available.  What in the heck is fried mustard? Guy in front of me asked for it.  Anyway; solid burgers but terrible chocolate shake. The vanilla was much better. Friendly service. Place is clean.,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,This is an interesting little place. My friend decided to go here during my visit to the area. This was really surprising as I fancy them as a fitness and health person. it was pretty busy. I would have never imagined them going here. You order your burger and fries and wait until it is cooked. It is not sitting in a bin somewhere for an hour. I ordered the double because I thought the burgers were smaller.  The burger was really good and the fries were also fresh cut. Of course I did not finish it off as I was full after the first burger and some fries. If you are up for a fast meal with more freshness than some other joints than check it out.,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Awesome burgers and fries. Super friendly service; and a clean eating establishment. Did I mention the burger's are awesome? Fries are super tasty as well. In my grand rating of Burger joints I've visited... In-N-Out is greater than Five Guys is greater than Steak and Shake is greater than Shake Shack.,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Give me a Double Double with Extra Extra Extra Extra EXTRA grilled onions and I'm happy camper. Their burgers are always freshly made to order and tasty. Despite some people who hate their fries I like them more and more each time. Again made fresh from fresh sliced potatoes.  I don't know where they get their tomatoes from but I've loved them ever since I was kid a really helped me get over my dislike of tomatoes.  Didn't I mention that their milkshakes are killer too???? I really don't know what I'd do if I lived somewhere where they didn't have In N' Out Burger. Guess I'll be west coaster for life.,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,The food is great when they do it right but otherwise my orders are mostly wrong. I get cold buns and burnt patties and when I ask for ketchup they forget most of the time. I would recommend another in n out.,0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"Cruised though the drive-thru on our way to see a movie at the nearby Desert Ridge AMC theater. Typically In-N-Out is quick; delicious; and way better than McD's. Sadly; this was not one of those nights.   We ordered three burgers; three drinks; and an order of fries for the three of us and requested the orders be placed in separate bags so we could take (smuggle) the food into the movie theater (we were pressed for time and starving; okay?!). The order took longer than usual to pick up at the window and when I asked which was the burger with ketchup and mustard (instead of the \special sauce\"") the server just stared at me blankly and said I should be able to tell. Right; but I was hoping to figure it out before biting into my friend's burger! Thankfully I don't have a food allergy so it wasn't a big deal; but still kinda annoying that our burgers got swapped and we couldn't figure out which was which.   I think I'll stick with my usual In-N-Out in Tempe; thank you!""",0
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Good; cheap; burgers. Fries are/not very greasy; service is excellent; even when busy. Ask for fresh fries. !!!,1
byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Two words for ya! ANIMAL STYLE. The menu here is very simple. It hasn't changed since it opened in the early 1900's. Nothing but burgers; fries and shakes made from the freshest ingredients! My meal of choice: Double Double; Animal Style with fries and a Lemon-Up (or root beer).   This burger joint is NOT a franchise; it's family owned; so you are getting way better customer service and quality food than you'll find at McD's or BK! There's nothing gourmet about an In-n-Out burger; they are just so damn tasty! Only downside is that they're only on the west coast! Sorry East coast!,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,We popped in for a quick bite and ordered the chicken cheesesteak and turkey pesto panini. Chicken is seasoned well; but the panini and salad are AWFUL!!!! 1st and last time for us! Lettuce is wilted and tastes dirty.  Asked for no onions twice and they are piled on! Out of steak and most drinks in the fountain drink dispenser. The dressing tastes like it is all vinegar. Way too pricey ($30) for the quality of the food!!! Save your time and money....,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,First time I went I loved their chicken curry . It had a great spicy flavor and sweetened with raisins; apples and pineapple. Second time visiting I felt the food was inconsistent. The curry had few pieces of fruit and lacked flavor. We also ordered the grilled veggies. They were cooked perfectly but extremely over salted. I will be back for lunch but will probably avoid dinner time.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,if you've ever seen a highly rated place and wondered 'is it really that good?' That isn't going to be much of a question for long once you've eaten here.   You walk into a pretty nondescript place. It sits on a corner with a few outside tables. Walk in and your order from a board (or plastic menu on the counter) and you probably think 'eh; what's the big deal?' BUT WAIT...  You order from the menu with a variety of delicious options; you hope delicious anyway. Everything in the pictures look good; but wonder if it is. DON'T.  This place will fool you. You expect it to be clean; it's spotless; you expect the food to be good; but good is for the mediocre. This is high quality; great tasting; beautifully prepared food that tastes almost gourmet.   I know; I was as shocked as you.   I ordered the shrimp del sol with the tails of the shrimp taken off (and they so kindly did it) and was blown away. I wish I could go back and experience the first taste again. It was deliriously good. I mean; memorably.   It was made of a bed of lettuce with a black bean and corn salsa with avocado and shrimp. It was soooooooooooo good. I would advise that you mix it all together. The components are all incredible alone; and beyond delicious together. So; mix it up. On top is the chipotle cheese crisp. You will know bliss when you taste the first bite of one of these. I warned you. Let the addiction begin (I'm wayyy ahead of you).  It's the only thing I had; but truthfully; I don't need anything else to write this review. I'm convince everything there has to be just as good. It's made with such good ingredients and is so beautiful to look at; I know they didn't just do it for me. It's a sign of absolutely loving the food you present.   Not only will I be back; but i'll be back again and again.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,We order from Pita Di Vita about twice per month. Nobody can grill chicken like this guy; it's just fantastic. Very reasonably priced. Probably the kind of place that you order takeout rather than going there to eat- not the greatest eat-in atmosphere. As far as take out goes it can't be beat. Fresh ingredients; health Mediterranean fare; friendly service. I sincerely hope that these guys are around for a long time. The Chicken Philly sandwich and Di Vita salad are our favorites.,1

ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,"I had the spicy chicken wrap. It was really spicy; well...on the bright side; I had lots of water to drink with it.   First of all; the place is a tiny place with no fancy decorations but it is okay if you want to just grab your food to-go. Secondly; they make the food pretty fast. My sisters and I got our order in about 5-7 minutes. One of my sisters had the vegetarian wrap and the other one got a gyro (both really good; too). The only thing I would \complain\"" is the price; my wrap is about $9. Granted; it is big but I don't think it is worth the price. I would come to this place maybe once in a while. So; would I come back here again? Yes. Would I be a regular? Nah.""",0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Food was great. Got the BBQ pita and tried Philly steak pita. Decent price (9/10); awesome service (10/10); fair atmosphere (5/10) and pretty good selection (7/10). We would definitely go back for lunch; not so much my first choice for dinner.,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,LOVE this place! I was a Pita Jungle devotee for years (still a fan); but Pita Di Vita has won me over. My husband and I stumbled upon it because it's across the street from our business and fell in love with the food. A lot of similiar flavors to PJ (I believe their are some family ties) so if you like them; you'll LOVE PDV.  The La Vita salad is phenomenol and huge. I order it and make sure to get an extra side of the lemon dressing b/c it's big enough for two meals. (Dressing is awesome!) Also; if you can't handle TWO meals; you can order a small like 1-2 oz. sample cup of the hummus (amazing) that I eat alongside my salad to dip the veggies in. Try the Jalepeno Cilantro hummus....freaking fabulous!  Anyways- the owners are friendly; the food is incredible. 5 stars all day.,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,My 1st experience there started off on the wrong foot; but I enjoyed the food so I gave it a second chance - I'm glad I did.  Knowing I had no cash when I got there I asked if they take debit/credit just to be sure and the cashier said no - only Amex.  Hmmm.  I said ok; strange; and started walking out when she said oh wait they take everything but Amex.  Ok; so I ordered a falafel pita and salad.  Paid; sat down; then found out they were out of falafel; so I got the chix shawarma instead.    The pita was really good; overflowing with fillings; very flavorful; fresh veggies and it was nice & juicy.  The salad was fairly standard Greek fair with mixed greens but it was fresh & tasty.  Generous portions for both; right around $9.  Because I did enjoy the food I went back and got that falafel pita I wanted so much; it was really good as well.  I like that they put some hummus on the falafel pita; and both pitas had plenty of pickles - a favorite of mine.  The place is tidy; has a pretty varied menu; decent prices and so far so good with the food.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,What a shame; Pita Di Vita has unfortunately closed. This was such a perfect spot for fast and awesome take-out; but I think because of some personal events; the owner had to close the doors. All the best to the family.  Great for take out! The Chicken Curry is killer! Order a pita wrap; combo; or a side of chicken breast and your favorite side and you're good to go.  The front counter order takers are inviting and friendly; and the head chef/owner is amicable. Service is quick; especially if you call it in ahead for pickup.  The chicken platter and sonoran chicken are both fantastic. The sonoran chicken has a great blend of southwestern flavors and the side of beans makes the meal. Chicken is never dried out; head chef knows what he's doing.  Desserts (baklava and honey pudding) are simple; delicious; and authentic.  Simple ingredients; simple atmosphere; and healthy outlook on food make this place a perfect choice for a quick lunch or dinner on a whim. We frequent here often.  I only wish they had tabouli!,1

ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Went in for lunch today. Ordered the curry chicken for takeout. This was my first time here but I saw the good Yelp reviews so I knew it was safe.   Dayum dayum dayum! I like my food spicy and they did it right! The curry chicken is pretty fabulous. There are pieces of fruit in the sauce; the chicken tastes great and the rice was so delicious and fragrant. Can't wait to go back!,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Great food at a reasonable price. I have been there a couple of times now and will return. Nothing fancy but good service and tasty pitas. I've had the chicken shawarma and the BBQ chicken. Yum!,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,The owner is a bit of a crumudgeon if you ask to substitute an item on a plate; but he will; if you are insistent enough about it. I admit that when I walked away from the register; I was a little miffed. After all; I am the customer and if I don't want rice on my dish; isn't that my prerogative? However; once the food was set down in front of me and I began to dig in; all of my angst melted away.  I ordered the chicken curry dish; which is a Mediterranean take on an old Thai recipe. It originally came served on hope of rice. I don't eat rice so I persuaded the chef to serve hummus on the side instead of the rice. I'm glad I did. The hummus is smooth and creamy; just the way I like it. The curry was simply out of this world; spicy and full of coconut milk; pineapple; raisins and apples--all there to add a sweet little bite. The chicken itself is so juicy and succulent you would be hard pressed to find a better cooked piece of meat.  So; I offer kudos to the chef on his cooking but wish he would be more sympathetic to his customers' dietary needs and tastes. And if substituting is really that big a deal then maybe put up a sign: No substitutions; please.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,First yelp. Be kind. :)  Was Friday lunch when a friend and I decided to try this local joint. It's located in a shopping center; next to the mega Lifetime gym in Gilbert. Easy to miss since it's tucked away in the corner but just know that it is in the same plaza as Zipps Bar and Grill.   The place was quaint; non pretentious; hybrid of a cafe and fast food set up; which is a casual place to relax and catch up with a friend. They have a couple patio sets out front to dine at as well.   Most traffic coming in and out of the restaurant that day was for take out. The menu looked fresh and tasty. Their website is done well and was one of the reasons that got me here in the first place. Prices are good for the amount of food you get.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap. It was the size of a Chipotle burrito but with much bolder flavors and a punch. It was filled with rice; black beans; chicken in a wonderful spicy sauce; jalapenos and other goodness that tasted really well together. Came with a side of yogurt sauce that helped balance the heat. Really was a great meal enveloped in a warm flour wrap. Couldn't finish the darn thing so let my friend have at it and he agreed to the tastiness. My friend got the Chicken Shawarama which I had a taste. Chicken tender; more fresh veggies so it is lighter than the Spicy Chicken; but still very well seasoned. It's wrapped in a Pita for easy enjoyment! For both; bill was about $13.   In all; great tastes; good prices; easy atmosphere. I would come back.   Only thing that I can dock on was that it was a tad bit slow to get our food considering we were the only ones there and no AC for first 15 minutes of sitting down but I had good company so its a minor critique.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,My visit at Pita di Vita was excellent! I liked how there were pictures of all the food. It was very clean and the guy that took our order was extremely friendly and a lot of help. I ordered the Spicy Chicken pita wrap. It was so good; lots of flavor; and HUGE! I will definitely be going back to this place!,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,The food here is amazing.  Fresh and prepared to order.  I had the grilled veggies and chicken with the home made hummus (so much better than store bought!). My friend had the chicken platter; both were excellent.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was the price.  I will certainly eat here again; just not as frequently as I might like due to the cost.  But it is certainly worth it for really good Mediterranean food when the craving hits.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Would've given a 3.5 if possible. Good and quick food! Loved the original hummus- solid flavor. Also ordered chicken curry and a falafel pita. Good flavor in both dishes but did not leave us wanting more or tempted the same dishes again. Lot of food though which is good for an empty belly and tight wallet!,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,I love the food here. Like... Way too much. I work down the street and even if I bring lunch with me; I will drive down and order some hummus and chicken anyway. Sack lunch be damned!  The chicken in every dish is juicy and so fricken flavorful. The veggies are really fresh. The pita is soft and warm. The hummus (three kinds!) is creamy and delicious. The staff are friendly. So many excellent things.,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,We finally gave this place a try after passing it up due to lack luster curb appeal.  It was terrific!  Wish we'd tried it sooner.  We had a traditional Gyro and a Philly Pita.  The meats and veggies were so fresh and tender.  Both sandwiches were generous and completely yummy.  The pita bread itself was the best I've ever had.  This is a clean & tidy little place that serves fresh; tasty meals made to order. I liked that  you can see into the kitchen when ordering.  The restaurant is somewhat small but there is a good amount of seating; with a few extra tables on the patio.  Give it a go.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,We ate here last night for the first time- It was GREAT!  The grilled vegetalbe were out of this world as was everything else we ordered!  I highly recommend!,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Wonderful meal! I had the chicken schawarma by recommendation of the woman taking our order. My husband had the garlic shrimp. Both were delicious. This is a very casual; clean environment; paper plates; plastic forks etc. but decent prices. Nice people; good customer service. No booze.,1

ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,"Had lunch here today and was very impressed!  The place is pretty utilitarian inside but definitely clean and comfortable.  I ordered the Veggie Primavera wrap with a side Greek salad.  The wrap was literally bursting with veggies--cauliflower; zucchini; broccoli; 2 types of beans; and rice all on a wheat wrap.  It's definitely not something you can eat gracefully!  Sooo good but so much food I had to take half home!  The wrap was served with a side of delicious tzatziki sauce. The Greek salad was also good--lots of fresh veggies; the salad dressing was a little different than your \normal Greek\""--had almost a spicy horseradish/mustard taste which I'm not sure if I liked or not.  Beautiful presentation; huge portions!  If you order your entree as a meal; it comes with either a side salad or French fries and a HUGE cup for soda.  Will definitely be back!!""",1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Great food.  Great service.  Everything is fresh and tasty!,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Great food. Big portions. The service was great. We took 9 people with us and they accommodated us with happy faces and got our food out fast; even with the 5+ take out orders they had going on too.,1

ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,My husband and I just went for the first time. It was delicious! I had the Shrimp del Sol salad. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the spices on it were so yummy. The dressing is tart but a little sweet. I could eat it by itself.   We got hummus as well; it was even more delicious at room temperature.   The portions are huge and the service was great. This is a new favorite place for us.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Great food! Friendly service! My faves are the Shrimp del Sol and the La Vita Salad. The shrimp dish was very spicy but ohhh so good. La Vita Salad was delicious and I really enjoyed the mix in it: chicken; lettuce; olives; feta; artichoke...and the portions are enough to get you full. This place is my fave for gyros too.,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Listen up all you Pita Jungle eaters. You need to try this out! The speed at which they give you food that I would count second to none is amazing. Service with a smile in an awesome to city that is rare to find in a strip mall Restaurant.,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,First time here. It was very convenient to stop here after the gym and pool time with the family. We took it to go. We ordered the chicken shawarma and the gyro. Both with meals and side salads. My daughter got the kids cheese crisp. They packed it nicely to go and there wasn't a mess in the car. Both adult meals was a good size. Keep some gum handy or be prepared to brush your teeth after. The sauce is heavy with onions..not in a bad way when u are eating but will need an after meal mint. Good quick meal and it's not grease.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,I went in for lunch with a friend and we told the guy at the register that we were visiting the restaurant for the first time. He immediately gave us a thoughtful recommendation and we ended up ordering what he had suggested. I got the Philly Gyro; my friend got the Chicken Curry; and we split a side order of hummus. The weather was nice so we decided to eat outdoors on their patio. We started with the hummus and it was excellent--our server told us that it is made from scratch in-house. The main entrée came out a few minutes later and it was delicious.   To top things off; our server brought us out a small dessert on the house in order to thank us for stopping by.  In summary: excellent service; reasonable price; and excellent food.  I would recommend this place highly to anyone!,1

ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Good food and very good service.,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,I love this place! I've never actually eaten inside because we always get take out. The grilled vegetables are to die for!! I usually order the falafel wrap and hummus. The green hummus has the perfect amount of heat. Last night I had the tiramisu for the first time and I could have eaten at least 3 more little cups; so yummy!!,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,I went in a little skeptical and was pleasantly surprised.  The location is a bit confusing to get to; but once you're in there; the ambiance is clean and cozy.  The food choices are good and the plates I ordered were delicious.  The greens in my sandwich were fresh and crisp; the meat portions were generous. It was a great lunch; great food at a great price.,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,"I love their chicken curry dish; but I think it is odd that it is served on a large plate with nothing else.  Is that so my whole family can eat it?  I would prefer a smaller portion and include some vegetable; pita; etc.   Also; both times we ate there; the young lady at the register seemed not interested in helping us.  For example; I asked her what the grilled vegetables were.  Her answer was that they were vegetables that were grilled.  I asked again; what vegetables?  She pointed to the menu where it said \grilled vegetables\"".  After the third round of \""what vegetables are in it?\""; I suggested she ask the chef.   She did; reluctantly.  I think this girl needs a different job.  I ordered the grilled veggies and they are delicious; by the way.""",0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Update:  Hold the presses!  Tonight I returned to Pita di Vita and just discovered a salad that would launch a thousand ships.  Helen of Troy move over!   I ordered the Shrimp de Sol salad.  Was it cosmic convergence or dumb luck that found me the sort of salad that seduces you into eating it and then satisfies every part of your palate?  Even a manly man could sit down to this heaping bowl of garden greens; red onions; black beans; sweet corn; avocado; gourmet dressing; and grilled  jumbo-sized shrimp and satisfy the deep hunger that lingers within.  Add to that ensemble a soft; warm pita topped with artisan cheese and you have love.  Hey; I am not afraid to say that I was beside myself in consuming this magnificent culinary feat.  Beautiful salad.  Do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.      Original Review: Ate at Pita di Vita last night.  Thumbs way up!!!  Most of the trainers at Funktional Fitness swear by this place so I had to go see what all the rage was about.  It's true.  The rich variety of pita offerings is impressive.  I had the falafel pita.  It rocked--and falafel pitas and I go way back.  The salads and paninis look very inviting.  The ingredients were fresh.  The service was professional and fast.  The guy who owns the place is really friendly.  Lots of good looking; healthy people stop by given that this place is next to a very popular workout scene.  I highly recommend that you stop by.  They have something for everyone at an affordable price.  Eat well. Be well.,1

ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Kind of a hole in the wall and wasn't sure at first.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  I loved the Philly gyro. The kids grilled chicken was tasty and juicy.  The side of steamed broccoli was large and cooked just right.  Will come back!,0
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Great place; clean atmosphere; fantastic food; outstanding service. The owner Samir is awesome!,1
ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Stumbled upon this little gem as it is nestled in a strip mall next to my gym. The hubby and I needed a quick bite to eat one day for lunch and this sounded good. We love hummus and pitas so why not.   Very low key atmosphere nothing special on the inside but the food is so yummy! They were really busy both times I stopped but I would recommend that they invest in the decor and menu approach as at first glance it doesn't compare to the good.  I love their picante hummus (cilantro and jalapenos) and their warm pitas are really good. My husband had a barbecue chicken wrap  that looked really good and he said that he enjoyed. Since our first visit I have ordered hummus and extra pitas on take out and they are really fast!  With lower prices and yummy food - not to mention the proximity to my house I think Pita di Vita is replacing Pita Jungle for me.,0
638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,Subs are great!  Our favorites are the Engineer and the New York Steamer!  We recently tried their Sriracha Beef sandwich and weren't as thrilled as we are with everything else.  Along with good tasting food comes great service.  They are extremely friendly!,1
638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,Map is wrong; it's on the west side of the road. You have to repeat your order 4-5 times and there is only 1 soda machine that served 1 person at a time. Reason that's an issue is because this guy was filling up his 6 cups and took forever. And then when it's your turn you feel rushed because you don't want to be like that guy. Food is great though! Make sure to listen for your name; 2 other customers names were called out wrong.,0
638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,"New location; so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to speed.  SO SLOW!!  The sandwiches taste great and really fresh; but be prepared to wait quite awhile during peak times.  Pricing is fair; and I LOVE the Coca Cola Freestyle pop machine they have there; which dispenses around 21 different brands of pop; each with 2-7 different flavors per brand.  7 flavors of Fanta and 4 flavors of Mello Yello?  Who knew!  Plenty of indoor seating; with some outdoor seating as well.  Parking kind of sucks because there's only about 7 spots directly outside the restaurant...so get used to parking by McDonalds and walking over.  Ok; back to the wait times.  I have been there twice.  The first time was only a couple days after they first opened their doors for business; and I waited in line about 5 minutes and it took 10-15 minutes to get my sandwich after paying for it.  At that time(roughly 3pm on a weekday); there wasn't many people there; so I was a little concerned about how long my sandwich took.  Today was my second time there; and this time I was there at the peak of lunch hour(12:15 on a weekday).  The place was packed with people and the line was long enough to span the entire front counter area.  The line seemed to be moving along ok; and within about 5-7 minutes I was placing my order.  This is where you thank me for telling you to bring your smartphone with you.  I waited a solid 20 minutes to get my sandwich today; and that's after I the initial wait to place the order.  I'm not sure if there is any prioritization on \to go\"" orders; or if they just made first in first out; but there was a pretty big group of us waiting in the corner for our to-go orders.  Now I understand why they have a sign in there that says; \""Save time; order online ahead of time!\"".  I will test that out on my next visit.  Overall; good place to get a fresh sandwich.  The Steak & Cheese and Meatball sandwiches are pretty good; and the New York Steamer is a good choice if you like beef brisket with with pastrami.  I'll be back; but next time I will try to avoid the busy times of the work day.""",0
638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,Subs are good.  Reason I gave a 3 star is because I feel the customer service and time can step it up.  Second time I have been here and both times they are very slow at making the subs.    Tonight I walked in and order 3 subs.  I am the only customer in the joint.  4 employees working.  I place my order.  After I place my order; the cashier goes and sweeps;one gal starts to make the subs; another employee is cleaning the counter along the back wall and another is doing something else.  One would think that maybe another employee would stop what they were doing to help make 3 subs.  Nope; left it up to the girl and she was very slow.  A few other people walk in and order and then another employee starts on their subs.  Mind you; my order is still not complete.  I think I will stick with Subway next time.  More options; less expensive. Faster service and it still fills me up.,0

638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,I will have to go back and perhaps try a hook and ladder. I went for the first time and ordered the meatball. On the board it says that it includes Italian sausage but there was none on my sandwich. The service was good but I'm not convinced it was worth the price.,1

638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,My husband orders weekly from here to cater business lunches so I thought is give it a go for home.  I ordered 4 subs and 2 salads and the subs were great.  Sadly the salads were meatless and just had wilted lettuce; watery tomatoes; olives and something white chopped up.  No meat.  To say I am disappointed is a massive understatement. I think my husband may need to rethink his catering company,0
638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,I ordered 7 sandwiches and several other items.  Everything was ready and bagged when I arrived.  When I got to the office to and distributed the sandwiches; I noticed there was a sandwich missing.    The first person wanted me to drive back to their store to pick up the sandwich.  When I told him I was going to drive back to their store because of their mistake; he transferred me to a manager.    The manager took control of the situation and said she would deliver the sandwich.    Better late than never.,1
638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,"Well unfortunately; I have been duped yet again....  yet again another BAD experience at this location when ordering more than (1) sandwich.

638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,The map is wrong on this; it is just south of germann off of gilbert rd on the east side of gilbert rd.  The food is pretty damn tasty. The white chicken salad sandwich is good. Prices are reasonable and they have an awesome pop machine that has over 100 different sodas or something crazy like that.  The old man who works the register; at least during lunch the last 2 Thursdays I have gone; should be in a home. He is so over matched by the entire ordering process that it is painful. He has gotten my sandwich wrong both times even though I knew he was struggling and tried to even point to the menu to tell him what I wanted. Luckily they can remake the sandwiches quickly but I've seen multiple people turn their sandwiches back in; I'm guessing for the same reason.  If you own this place; PLEASE let that employee go or find him a new position; he is NOT able to handle the register. All 4 of the other employees made sure to welcome me when I walked in but he is the one that has to ring me up? When I brought my incorrect sandwich back and told them this was the 2nd week in a row he did the same thing; they laughed and said he is a good guy. I bet he is; just not a good register person.  I love the help the firemen angle and $ going back to their charities and all; but please hire a competent register worker.,1
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,I always enjoyed this place prior to its remodel. The staff was always nice;Now I must say its the worst McDonald's EVER! They never seen to get my order right; food is always cold and never fresh. For all who want to complain I finally was able to get a correct phone number. (602-404-9785) Spoke to the so called manager Mariciela; while I was explaining the situation she was not even paying attention just giggling while I was speaking. Didn't seem to even care. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE FOR ANYTHING; EVEN IF ITS FREE. Just wish I could give a negative stars.,1
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,Ordered a sausage egg mcmuffin this morning. Got home. No egg. On a friggin egg mcmuffin. Mctarded.,0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,Worst McDonald's I have ever been. Unfortunately is close to my house and if I want something quick when I'm in a rush I stop there. Every time there is something missing from my order. They are extremely slow and are constantly out of products such as dressing for the salads. I give this place 2 thumbs down and hope management fixes the laziness of its employees and the quality of food even for a fast food chains standards. Just horrible!,0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,Mainly use drive thru at this location and for the most part they are usually fairly quick and get your order right. Average location.,0

qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,We started going to this location as soon as it was built because it was really close to our home. After the first two visits after opening; the staff changed and everything went downhill. At this point; it's reached the bottom of the hill and burrowed into the ground!  There have maybe been two or three times when they have remembered to put all the items ordered into my bags in the drive thru. Four out of the last five times I have gone through the drive thru; I've had to pull back around front and go inside to get my remaining items that were just sitting in the sandwich holding area! They just say sorry and give them to me; but never fix the issue for the future!  The food is always sloppy and the buns are usually burnt black. I know stuff isn't going to look like the commercials; but I don't want to eat something that looks like dog food between two carbon crusted pucks of bread! This isn't a review of all McDonald's; just this location. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! The service is terrible; the food is terrible; and every experience I've had there is terrible! I hope corporate steps in and cleans out the staff to get a crew that actually cares.,0

qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,"I have been to this McDonald's one too many times.  More times than not there service is sub-standard even for a McDonald's.  I had made the decision to not go back; however they were supposedly under new management after their remodel.  Guess again; they either rehired the same idiots or just trained new ones to be that dumb.  Today the manager was extremely rude about a mistake her worker made while taking the order.  It took 3 times of her refunding and reordering to get it right.  How hard is to ring in 3 items (none of which were a Quarter Pounder) and get it wrong and different totals.  No apology only a sarcastic; \Are you happy now!\"" remark.  And just a note; you CANNOT get your drink large at this McDonald's without upsizing the entire meal.

When I got to the 2nd window the guy handed me the coffee hot. I corrected him politely and said that I ordered it iced. He rolled his eyes and took the coffee back. Next thing I know he hands me an iced cup... With the SAME HOT COFFEE IN IT with melted ice floating around.   Was it really SO MUCH WORK to remake me an iced coffee how I ordered it the right way? When I asked if he had just put ice in the same hot coffee he said \Well it comes out hot anyway.\"" That's a complete lie. He was just too lazy and rude to remake it.

No thanks; no sense in driving back there and giving them any more business. I will never return here again. That guy should be fired. Horrible customer service!! Stay away!!!""",0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,"I can't believe I am even reviewing a McDonalds but it had to be done.   I just went in for an iced nonfat coffee. When I got to the 2nd window the guy handed me the coffee hot. I corrected him politely and said that I ordered it iced. He rolled his eyes and took the coffee back. Next thing I know he hands me an iced cup... With the SAME HOT COFFEE IN IT with melted ice floating around.   Was it really SO MUCH WORK to remake me an iced coffee how I ordered it the right way?

qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,Stay away at all costs. The last couple of trips thru the drive thru; everytume the order has been wrong. Of course you dont find this out till you get home. Diet Coke given instead of regular coke(which was ordered) and they are very stingy with the fries. Always 1/2 filled. Drive up to Burger King right up the street.,0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,McDonald's currently under construction.    Hopefully they retain the staff after it is complete.  Fairly friendly and typical service.  This was the only McDonald's I knew that served burgers all day.,1
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,"This has to be the worst McDonalds I've been to in 20 years... and I've eaten at many bad Micky D's.  Food is always cold and old.  Orders are correct about 50% of the time.  Employees are always rude.  Such a shame.  I've just moved to the neighborhood and unfortunately this is \my McDonalds\"".  But it's not completely hopeless.  My previous McDonalds in Fort Lauderdale was a poorly managed franchise too.  A couple of complaints to corporate headquarters fixed that place in a jiffy!  Don't bother calling the franchise; look for the corporate complaint number on your bag and call.  Franchisees HATE when you call corporate headquarters and they will be forced to improve or risk losing their franchise.""",0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,The worst McDonald's ever. They never get the order right. They are slow. And speak horrible English!,0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,I usually don't take the time to review fast food restaurants this one deserve it customer service is awful the food is awful the drinks as well are awful how can you mess with a drink I don't know ask them. They are always busy but yet Lack customer service I don't think I've ever gone to McDonalds that is as horrible as this one enough said will not return,0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,9 out of 10 times the order is  NOT complete. fries are re-fried and cold to boot. Order hamburger with NO pickes. They take the time to add the 'special order sticker' and put them pickles on anyway. Ask the person at the window if if everything is in the bag.. they smile and shake their head yes. Get home and missing items. Call the number listed and they invite you back for your item for free. (free? I PAID for it)  This happens ALL the time. Lots of workers; but still slower than a snail and they get it wrong. no pride in their work I guess,0
qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,Worst McDonald's ever. It's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right; but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth. Food is usually cold anyway. But it's  their management that's the worst. They treat you like the idiot; when it's their fault to begin with. If you call the posted customer service number; don't bother it's a recording and still have not received a callback. Avoid at all costs.,0

-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Searching for a place to eat tonight and we came across Firehouse on Yelp and figured we give it a try.  AWSOME place; food was fantastic; friendly people; only negative was I ordered a large sandwich because I was starving; that was a huge meal.  They put a generous portion of meat on each sandwich; unlike the Subways and Quizno's of the world.,1
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,This is my 2nd time reviewing this place. I gave it a pretty good review before but now I've changed my opinion. On two subsequent return visits; my orders were done incorrectly.  I'm talking 2 out of 3 sandwiches were wrong both times. It's a sandwich; not rocket science; kids.,0
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Great food and service! Try the Italian sub,1
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Love me some Firehouse Subs! Lovely service + sub!,1
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,I am not sure exactly how I feel about Firehouse yet. I feel like I need to go back and have a redo; for my first impression might be a wee bit biased. I stopped here for my sister and decided to go ahead and try it out. She loves it and cant get enough of it. I ended up ordering 4 sandwiches for me and my family. Unfortunately; I think at this time they were a little under staffed for there were a lot of people waiting in the dining room and the 2 employees working; were rushing like crazy. I ended up waiting 20 minutes for 4 sandwiches. I was in a hurry; so I was super annoyed; so this might be why my review is biased. When I finally got home; I felt like my sandwich was mediocre; nothing to rave about. A ton of people say Firehouse is WAY better than Quiznos or Subway....... but at those places I have never waited 20 minutes for a mehhhh sandwich. My family loved their subs; but my turkey; ham and bacon sub; was just meh.  This place is right down the street from my house and my sister eats here once a week; so Ill have to give it another try and see what happens. First visits aren't always the best; so you always owe it to yourself and the business to try again; because you never know. Well unless everything about the first visit was horrible. Haha!,0
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Love this place as an option to subway and lunch choices. Fresh food; great service; clean; lots of space; timely and not horrible prices. I love the Italian and cheesesteak. Great soda machines and two TVs with sports. Very addicting.,1
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Friendly service; excellent fresh food....good hot sauce... Try the mad dog 357 hot sauce! If you dare hahaha! Try it. They also have good local charities that contribute to the local economy! I recommend these sandwiches over subways. Excellent food; TVs with sports and ESPN make this a cool hangout place also. My whole family enjoys eating here.,1
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Great sandwiches. A little too pricey or else I would give 5 stars. Environment is great. Amazing selection of hot sauces. Very happy with customer service the times that I have visited this location.,1
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Went there because of reviews on yelp. Followed thru with the suggestion on what to order. The hero. Bring your appetite. Sandwich to large for 1 person. I finished the whole thing. I'm not that big of eater. Recommended.,0
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Pretty good. I'm not much of a sub eater but this was darned tasty; a good size and good service. We'll be back. Thanks!,1
-cy8EpdXs44iT3FR4En0QA,Location & Aesthetics - Not sure where this place is located except that it's in Queen Creek.  We stumbled upon it after a business meeting and our driver was asking us where we wanted to eat.  After much indecision; the driver said; let's eat here as he was passing by it and we all agreed saying why not.   There's lots of parking as it's located in a small strip mall.  The exterior and interior was exceptional clean including their bathroom and the whole place was well lit.  We came in a little after lunch and the place was quiet with no lines.  Menu - Can either be found on up on the wall behind the cashier.  Menus weren't overwhelming to read or comprehend and the cashier did answer any questions we had about our orders.  The sandwich comes in two sizes - an 18 inch and I believe a 21 inch though don't quote me on the latter as I'm not sure about it.  I opted for the 18 inch which was more than enough for me and very filling.  Service - The staff was very friendly and even brought out our meals to the table and even picked up our empty baskets and asked us how our meals were.  Food - I ordered the steak and cheese which was delicious.  The cheese was well melted; the steak well seasoned and soft; and the bread was soft and tender as if they just baked it themselves.  You can do the meal option which gives you a drink and chips.  For soda; they have one of those new fan dangled soda machines that boasts on offering over 100 choices.    Rating - 5/5.  Definitely can't find anything wrong with this place and only wished my trip was long enough for me to have returned!,1

For the value- price is fair not great but hey; firemen founded it!!,1

wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,"Sitting at my desk in my office; I could see a steady flow of coworkers returning from their lunch breaks with Fatburger soda cups. This was enough to make me crave a big; fat; juicy; heart clogging; carb-filled burger and fries. So one day I decided to venture out and have my own Fatburger experience.  I selected their King Burger combo meal because I always order more than I should. The meal consisted of a 1/2 pound burger; fries and a drink. I got the burger with all the fixins' and selected the fat fries. The total for the meal was $9.19.  Arriving before the lunch rush; there was almost no line. The order taker was friendly and didn't try to \upsize me\"" or sell me anything other than what I wanted. I waited a bit longer than I wanted for my meal; but I guess that is because they cook everything when it's ordered. My only complaint is that there were no suitable containers in which to take out ketchup. They had those little paper cup things but there was no top to keep the contents from getting all over my car. There were also none of those ketchup packets to be found so I left their establishment ketcupless.  Back in my office I found that the burger and fries actually look like what is on their menu which is a surprise. The size of the meal was very good and filled me up quite nicely and then some; so I guess the food and drink was a good value for my money. My only issue was the actual taste of the food. I found it very bland and average at best. They either need to better season their meat/bun/something or start using some \""secret sauce\"" to flavor up their burgers. I had the same issue with the fries. Thankfully; I was able to pile on salt and steal some leftover ketcup packets from the community fridge.""",0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,It's hit or miss here apparently.  Today; 8/25/12; the buns we're bordering on stale. That pretty much dampens the burger experience.  I know that it doesn't have to be this way because the Chase Field Fatburgers are always tasty.  I've had a good experience here before; but not today.,0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,I will never and I mean never go to Fat burger again. my roommate went to get us dinner he got home and they shorted us a burger. he called them to get it straightened out they said he was lying; therefore we are out of our money but that will be the last time. I suggest find a different place not worth the money anyways but if you do go be sure to check your bag before you leave n if they try to short your order smack the shit out of them.,0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,"2.5 Stars  This store has really gone downhill.  This visit could very well be my last one.  I would rather drive to the Tempe location and deal with the pan-handlers going forward.  Not sure how the owner of this store would operate it with my experience below!  My family and I place our order; good so far.  We're familiar with the menu so no having to guess.  If you are not familiar with Fat Burger they acknowledge your tips of a dollar or more by the whole crew shouting \Fat Tip\"" when prompted by the cashier.  I always give the kids a buck to get them to shout; well they just stared at me this time.  We walk over to the booths and find two out if the three booths duct tapped together; posted a pic of the red duct tape.  I could not peek at the third booth since it was being used but if I had to guess it had red duct tape too.  My daughter wanted a milk shake with her meal; not today they ran out of ice cream. It would have been easier if I was told of the outage while ordering rather than the cashier trying to figure out how much money was owed to me.  We get our meals and my wife heads over to the ketchup dispenser to find they were out of the self serve ketchup.  No problem I will ask for some; I am told they are almost out of ketchup and am handed like 4 or 5 to go packets.  I just left it at that since they were almost out.  As we are eating our meals I hear the kids preparing the food yell \""we're out of thousand island\""; first thought was what else are they going to run out of!  The next thought was; hey did someone drop a dollar on the tip jar to get them to shout!  This review is strictly for this location.  I hope this owner cleans up the place a bit and supplies the place with enough stuff to operate normally.""",0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Tastier and fresher than all of the other fast food options around; although you wait a little longer for it.  You can get choices here that you can't find at other burger and fry joints; and they make the food when you order it. The fat fries are good; and there's a Turkey Burger that is juicier and more flavorful than the beef - nevermind that it's healthier. If you won't be upsetting any allergies; have them spin you up a thick peanut butter milkshake.,0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Never going back.  First of all it's way too expensive for the crappy food we received.  The fries were nothing special and tasted worse than the kind that come frozen that you bake in the oven.  Customer service was rude and very unhelpful.  There's also a sign there that says they make all burgers medium well and mine had lots of pink in it (which I hate of course).,0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,This was my first visit to fat burger it was a fat disappointment! Restaurant was dirty it took forever for the burger to come and when it did it had no taste very blan no seasoning at all only pepper. This place was over priced for the quality and service of the food in my opinion if you charge restaurant  prices you should serve restaurant quality. This place charges 10.00 for a burger and an extra 1.00 for cheese and 1.00 for every extra you get on the burger the meal did come with onion rings that were the only good part of this meal. They should call this place fat onion rings because the burger was dry and tasteless I will not return to this place I live close by and was really hoping this would be my new burger joint:(,0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Bueller; Ferris; where's the flavor.  Absent.  I had an expiring groupon for Fatburger and decided to get a to go order for work lunch.  Staff service is ok; but they had the order set up for to eat there. No biggy.   We got our order quickly and had ordered the medium fat burger.  I got the onion rings and my co-worker got the fries.  I could not taste any flavor from the burger; and the bacon had that crispy leaning on the side of burned taste.   The onion rings tasted like the onions were fresh; but still the taste was lacking.   Fatburger; I'll pass.  This place is one where I will keep driving past and not stop again.,0

wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Burger is ok not the best not the worst. Fries hit or miss guess it depends who is cooking. Staff is usually very nice. Went there this week (Monday 6/10/13) for lunch. This time it was some white girl taking orders never seen her before working there but talk about rude and a stupid look on her face!!!! Wow!!! Ill go back but if I see her working the front ill go next door to Subway!!!! And I hate Subway!!!!,1
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Before the Peoria location opened; I'd never had a Fatburger; I think I saw the chain in other cities but had never eaten at one.  I ate at this one not long after it first opened; and I REALLY liked it.  It was one of the better fast burgers that I've had.  The fries were good; the place was clean; and I loved the number placard that they gave you to claim your meal with its music and burger trivia on it.  The placards went away; and apparently so did the initial quality and cleanliness.  I still like Fatburger burgers; but I don't know if I'll be returning to this location.  I no longer live in Phoenix; so I pretty much only get to Fatburger when I come to town; and always thought of this as a good place.  Well; sadly; it isn't that good of a place any more.  The burgers; in my opinion; still taste good.  But the place has suffered from neglect.  There were only two people working there when I went there a couple of nights ago; and they were out of BACON.  I gently chided the man on the register; how could a burger joint run out of bacon?  He said the manager didn't order enough.  And I guess it was impossible for a shift manager to take $40 out of the till and drive 3-5 miles to buy a bunch of bacon.  Pretty lame; IMO.  That's pretty trivial; but it is indicative of a problem.  There were other indicators.  First; the dining area hadn't been bussed.  Tables were dirty; and that is not good.  Second; the soda fountain had not been properly cleaned.  Several levers were sticky with syrup; and that level of stickiness takes some time to build up.  So proper cleaning procedure hadn't been followed for some time.  Third; again attesting to the dining room not being properly maintained; they were all but empty of the little cups that you load with ketchup for your fries.  They have two large bins for them and probably less than a dozen total available between the two.  To me; these indicate a total lack of concern from the owner/manager.  The franchise is not being properly supervised; procedures are not being followed; and that is a problem.  Let's talk about my meal.  My burger was cooked properly and done quickly.  There were two orders ahead of me and the woman at the grill seemed to be getting orders out speedily.  My cheddar cheese burger tasted good; even without the extra-crispy bacon that I wanted.  I've always liked the flavor of a Fatburger; it must be the meat and fat mix plus seasoning.  The fries; though hot; were a little under-done.  And the soda mix was not correct; I think too much soda water.  I did not get a refill; I nursed the one drink through my meal and got icewater when I left.  This is; after all; Phoenix summer.  I would give them three stars for food; if they'd had the bacon I might have given them four.  So why am I giving them two stars overall?  A couple at a table had a problem with their meal.  I don't know what; but the woman was talking about how she couldn't eat it.  Maybe the order was incorrect or they included something on her burger that she had a sensitivity to.  Regardless; the workers did not satisfy them; as a result the woman complained throughout their meal and said 'This is going up on Yelp as soon as I get home!'  Well; it hasn't yet; so she either calmed down and realized that she was perhaps overreacting or she just didn't get around to it.  But the workers did nothing to placate them.  Any small business; especially food; needs repeat business; and they lost those two customers that night.  Maybe the workers didn't have the authority to satisfy the people with a future comp'd meal; which would indicate that the owners/managers have a weak set of procedures in place that produced dissatisfaction.  I got the feeling that the place was under-staffed.  I never saw more than two people; and neither came in to the dining room to clean.  After the unhappy couple left without busing their table; that table sat uncleaned for over half an hour until I left.  But on top of that; they had very little business that evening.  I arrived around 7pm and stayed for an hour.  One person came in after that picking up an order to go; one family came in just as I was leaving.  That's not enough business to justify staying open.  Maybe it was a slow night.  Maybe they were shot-staffed that night.  Maybe management is on vacation.  Regardless; this location's owner and management need to take a serious look at how this site is operating; because otherwise; they're going to start losing money if they're not already.  For me; there are lots of places to get hamburgers; including Smashburger; The Habit; Steakenburger; Wineburger; etc.  There's lots of places to get good burgers; and all of those locations have better numbers than this Fatburger.,0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,These burgers are A-OK; I like that you can get a small; medium; large; x-large; and super large sized burgers.  I ordered a medium and it was a little juicy (not bad for a fast food burger) but I would still say that 5 guys or Smashburger is a little better.  Still these guys don't make a bad burger at all and I would stop in again and recommend it if you are a burger connoisseur that needs to taste every burger.  I like that this location is close to my office and I was headed to Culver's before I came here but that place smelled so bad inside I had to walk out.  I also like the atmosphere here; it is a nice clean casual looking place and comfortable to enjoy a quick lunch.,0
wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,So yesterday I found myself without a lunch at work.  Normally my driver goes for take out so when that happens I will just order something from wherever she is going.  Well it turns out she had brought lunch.  I had walked by the Fatburger in Tempe and on Las Vegas Blvd several times but had not tried either.  I had the time so decided to make the 15 minute drive over there.  I did take out so I would not be away from the shop for too long.  I arrived about 11:45 on a Friday which should have been a busy lunch crowd.  With todays economy I am not sure that is a normal statement any more.  The manager was having a smoke on the patio and greeted me on the way in.  Three tables were occupied; two full and one with one person.   As I walked in and was looking at the order board one of the customers came up to the two people working in the cooking area with a problem.  Seems his hamburger wasn't right and there seemed to be a problem describing what he really wanted or by the employees understanding what he was trying to explain.  The manager saw the exchange and came in immediately; figured out what was needed and the next hamburger off the grill was prepared correctly and delivered to the table by the manager with apologies.  In these days of patrons expecting free meals and future discounts I feel this was the proper way to fix things; the customer was not rude and he got the correct; fresh; not reworked; hamburger in short order; problem fixed without any fuss.  The manager then came over to the register and took my order; sensing it was my first time he guided me through the options.  I ordered a Fatburger less mustard; plus cheese ($4.49) and onion rings ($3.29).  As he was taking the order he hollered each item out to the staff and when complete took them the paper copy.  Must be the corporate way to do this.  The order was ready in about 10 minutes.  The burger was good but not fantastic; the bun was fresh and soft.  I consider it a good thing not to succumb to pressed onion rings however these folks have found a way to squeeze the maximum number of rings per onion.  The thin rings of onion with one exception were barely enough there to hold the batter and you could not taste the onion.  The oil was at the correct temperature so the batter did not absorb grease or have any off flavor.  I would definitely pass on the onion rings next time and try the fries.  Overall it is not a place I would go out of my way for but if it was convenient it wouldn't be out of the question to go again.  Directional note:  Google maps shows it on the SE corner of 28th Dr. and Peoria; it is really on the SW corner.,0
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,"Not a bad alternative to some of the other trite; we usually get the chicken nuggets which are fresher and seem much less processed than some of the other alternatives and are pretty tasty; I enjoy the waffle fries and coleslaw; a guily pleasure of ours are the handspun milkshakes especially the cookies and cream; and I get a kick out of the \my pleasure\"" which is more customer service than mcdonald's version which consists of thrusting the bag out the window (usually short items and condiments) to have the window slammed on me.""",0

And their selection of sauces..... Polynesian sauce on that Spicy Chicken? Heavenly....  OH. Sauces are free by the way. I hate fast food chains that charge for sauces; dressings and dips. that's nonsense.  This location is situated in a busy plaza....however; they have their own little parking...and little drive through.. If you don't want to get out in the heat...  Loved the service here...the staff are friendly and would offer you help (bigger bag; extra sauce; help to carry stuff in the car).. I came with a semi big complicated order...No tomato; no pickle; no both on some......and they got it all right. that's what i like. Clean tables as i noticed while i was waiting; Neat counter; where all the ketchup (in cute little squirt containers); and sauces are at...   I can't wait till Chick- Fil-A in the Southbay opens with this great kind of staff and awesome kind of service.,1

LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,"Stopped here for breakfast the other day.  I love their biscuits!  I got a chicken biscuit and a 4 piece Chick Fil A chicken minis.  Total was just a bit over 5 bucks.  Here is how they were..........  Chicken Biscuit- Delicious!  My favorite thing from this restaurant.  I prefer it over their chicken sandwiches and everything else.  The biscuit is soft; buttery and delicious.  The chicken is always prepared perfectly.  I should have gotten 2 of these.  You will see why; next.  Chick Fil A Minis-  Eh...they were just alright.  A bit skimp for the price.  The \buns\"" they use for these things are like cinnamon rolls without the heavy icing.  They are kind of hard to describe.  I didn't really enjoy them though.  They had an almost \""stale\"" taste/texture to them.  The chicken pieces were super skimp too.  I almost guarantee that those 4 mini pieces of chicken didn't add up to/equal what is in their biscuits.  I would not get these again.  Service is always friendly.  They are sincere and treat everyone well.  This place is pretty close to my house so I'm sure I will be back.""",1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Food is ok... I think its a bit overpriced though.. Service is good.. Just not a big fan..,1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,I loooooove Chic Fil A breakfast. I stop here sometimes during the weekend for a spicy chicken biscuit and hash browns. Yummy; high quality food! I don't know what's in their special sauce; but it's truly addictive.   This location has great service (like all Chic's I've been to!). The drive through gals are always friendly; fast and efficient.  If you're in the area; definitely try out this Chic Fil A!,1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,"This is one chain fast food place that I can't seem to steer clear of for some reason.  And I always order the normal sandwich.  Why change perfection?  Service at this location is quick and friendly.  Only thing to mar my experience was a shirtless guy and what looked like his mom wearing a too short skirt who sat down grumpily and yelled the \s-word\"" so loudly that it echoed into the kiddie play area.  I think I even saw a little girl faint in there. My appetite waned for a little until the delicious smell of the chicken sandwich wafted back to my nostrils.  I guess the food's too good for bad scenery to even stop me from chowing....although I did scarf as fast as possible so I could leave.  I mean; I know I'm not eating at a four star restaurant; but...decorum!""",1

LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,I have always had good service here. I had placed a catering order that somehow they lost; and they were able to turn the order around in less than 20 minutes the morning that I showed up to pick up the food. AMAZING!!!!!,1

LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Chick Fil-A is great. I came today for the free breakfast they have been giving away for the whole month of August. That's right the WHOLE month. I love that they have to say nice things when taking your order makes you feel like they care even if they really don't. Overall the service was great; quick and efficient.,1

LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,I was pleased to see this restaurant. I live In Las Vegas... Where we don't have the pleasure of binging on their yummy chicken. I was happy to find this location staffed with efficient employers. Our food order was correct and came out quickly.,0
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,I love a good chicken sandwich and ordered two of them for my brother and myself with a fry and a drink!    His sandwich was fine and he ate it all!  However my other sandwich had some very nasty chicken and was extremely unappetizing for me to enjoy and I threw all of it out!   I was very displeased and called the new owner of the place the next day to let him know that it was a bad experience for me!  He said he would take care of it when I came in the day i called!    He was extremely rude and seemed like he didn't want to refund my transaction so I just asked for another sandwich to try it again and he comped it for me.  This time it was ok and not as nasty!    I will never return to this place again and don't recommend it due to this experience.   The fries and drinks were great though!  Horrible new owner!,0
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,"Total guilty pleasure. My blood pressure probably jacks up faster than my ankles swell whenever I eat here; but it's just so stinkin good. My kids like the chicken nuggets too; and I like that I can get a cup of actual fresh fruit (not a baggie of apples) with their meals.   Last visit was this past Friday; and while the food tasted as chickeny and salty as ever (waffle fries; droooool); two things could have been different - the staff was very attentive with me; but what was up with sitting around and talking while other people were obviously waiting to place an order? Let's call it an 'area for improvement'; because that is not my normal experience here. I'd hate for others to think it's not good and not return.    But for the love of Sasquatch; please; please; please clean and deodorize the kids' play area. One of my kids; the one who asked me to NOT roll the window down after I heard a distinct fart from the back seat; stopped playing and said; \Mommy; it smells yucky in there.\"" Honestly. :P""",1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Gosh; I haven't been to a chick fila in ages! I was overdue to get my chicken on; so I stopped in here after my interview.  Place was like every other chick fila I've been to; and it was busy because it was a busy with lunch hour people.  The line was long when I got here; but the staff was really good about taking orders and getting the food out fast. I usually go with the regular chicken sandwich; which I think is a #1 on their menu.  The drinks here never seem big enough; and I had to get a refill mid meal.  Also; the fries seemed to be a little undercooked; but edible.  Even after the whole political thing about chick fila last year; I do frequent them from time to time. I don't normally come to this side of town; but when i saw them; I knew it was going to be good food. Overall good clean location; and their food usually doesn't disappoint. I LOVE their chicken bagels for breakfast! They are so tasty! It sux that their closed on Sundays; but oh well.,1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,I drive all over the metro Phoenix and surrounding. All chick fil a's I have been to have good customer service and great food.  However;  the Deer Valley and Surprise location are too conservative with their condiments. The Arrowhead 83 location seems more inviting and welcoming.  Seeing sauces sugars creamers full and stocked (not having to ask); just feels more welcoming.  When given the choice I will pass on the other 2 but will definitely make the Arrowhead 83rd and Bell my location to visit.,1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,This place is a staple for when my preschooler needs to let out some energy and we're all hungry. Food is always fresh; service is always outstanding.,1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,I don't know why I ever come here more often. I love Chick Fil-A; love their food; love their service. Let me see! What do I want? How about chicken!!!! Chicken sandwich; chicken tenders; breakfast chicken sandwich and chicken soda?? I wish they had chicken soda!!!! Oh yea; their fries are not that bad either!,1
LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Chicken sandwich is good; always fresh vegetables! Fast and friendly costumer service! Always clean and the staff is polite!  The fries are my favorite and also the part is free refills on the drinks!  I give it a 5 stars because I've been to many Chick-Fil-A's across the states and i always get the same exceptional service!  Good food!,1
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,Chipotle is AMAZING!! The guacamole is always fresh and delicious! The line is always long but it does move fast! The only thing that holds up the line is when people call in to go orders; the the line completely stops to make the to go order. Other than that I could eat there everyday!,0
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,Chipotle is Chipotle is Chipotle. Love the outdoor seating; the margarita options; and the fast; friendly service. It is a great location at Westgate and while others are fighting for a seat at the regular sit down restaurants; you can count on quality; consistent food at reasonable prices at this Chipotle location.,1
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,I've eaten at this Chipotle way more times than I would like to admit in the short time that it has been open.  It's the perfect quick and affordable meal before hitting up a game or event at the Arena.  The quality of the food and the service is as good as any Chipotle.  I'm really impressed with the facelift they have given to the space.  The old attendant; Moe's; had a very similar concept to Chipotle.  Chipotle could have been lazy and just slapped a new coat of paint on the walls; instead they redesigned the layout; and created the much more modern and inviting look that their restaurants are known for.,1
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,I have ate here on a daily basis for more than 6 months now and have received extraordinary service each time. The staff is fast and friendly. I'm lucky to have such a great place to each lunch so close to work.,1
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,I usually loveeee Chipotle's  and I order the bowl but this time I decided to order 3 tacos w flour shell; this was awful; they didnt wrap it individually it was all in one big foil; by the time it was time to eat them it looked like one big nasty mess; and wet from the steak meat; I had to throw it away after a couple bites; maybe the young teenage workers do not put much thought on the product since they are only there for gas and movies money right? oh well.,0
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,We go to this location many times but recently the portion size has drastically diminished. My husband and I ordered two burittos. One with sofrita and the other with steak. The gal gave us a 1/4 of a spoon of sofrita and said if I wanted more; we'd have to pay for double the sofrita. When asked about the sample size portion; we were told it was 2 ounces and that was the protein requirement. We had to double the steak for my husband too! Not going back to this location again.  If you need a children's size burrito then this is the spot for you!!!,0
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,This review is not about the food. The food at the Chipotle restaurants are generally the same in quality and taste. I have never had an issue with the taste of the food while being a consumer at this location but I have had terrible service time and time again.   I work close to this location ; at a company at Westgate. Myself and fellow co workers come to Chipotle often since there aren't many options in Westgate during the day at lunch time . Well; there is Buffalo Wild Wins; Which Which and Mama Gina's but everything gets really old; really fast. Chipotle has something for everyone ; so we go there.   The taste of the food is fine and the portion of food provided is AMAZING if you are a 5 year old child. You order a burrito bowl and or burrito and you get 2 servings of rice ; veggies and everything else by default and then when it comes to meat; you get a child portion. When you look confused and or concerned and ask for a little more they  respond by asking if you want double meat; which is an extra cost of course.  The chicken; steak and other meats are what make the meal. Not cheese; lettuce; hot sauce and beans. Those are used as fillers here. Where else do you go and spend 10 bucks for a burrito with meat in it that would better accommodate a taco?  I did not want to really speak about the customer service since I will not include employee names; although I have them. Often times you leave feeling rushed. If you change your mind; please expect a roll of the eyes. Trust that someone will be upset because you as the customer want to add beans last minute. How DARE you ask for your monies worth!!?  I really wish I did not have to create an account just to write this review but I had to. I have been working near this location and helping jeep them in business since January and I have been wanting to write this and or write corporate forever and just kept saying it fast food; its fine; it will get better.   It unfortunately does not; at least at this location!!!,0

hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,Went to this Chipotle tonight; ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked; hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.,0
hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,2 stars mainly for the lack of customer service bc chipotle; hands down; is the shit. My fiancé and I love chipotle. When we have a hard time deciding on what to eat; we already know where we're headed; Chipotle for my burrito or salad bowl depending on my mood and his meat lovers burrito.  Today we decided to try the online ordering system as we were in a hurry to get back to our Mariokart game and two cats. We get there a little past our 2:30 pick up time; went straight to the register as directed online and asked for our pick up order. The greeter then looks at her coworker at the beginning of the line and laughs while telling her that the 2:30 order needed to hurry up and be made bc it is 2:33. Not worried and in no terrible rush I wasn't completely bothered because I know chipotle is known for its fast and efficient service. What turned me off was there was no apology and she just hands us 2 soda cups with no eye contact or a heads up as to when our order will be ready. My fiancé and I are grateful for our free sodas and decide to just wait and refresh. As I see the cashier bagging our order I approach the register ready to pay. I told her I think that's our order. She doesn't care to see what it is and starts ringing me up anyway. I get my change and look in bag to make sure our order was correct. I realize my dressing for my salad bowl wasn't in there and I politely ask if she had put it in the bag. Maybe I missed it? She grabs a side of dressing and just drops it in the bag and turns away to continue talking to her coworker.  I personally thought the whole experience that should've lasted no more than a minute was the complete opposite of customer service. We go to this location all the time and have not had any problems but the one individual at the register was rude the second we walked in to the second we walked out.  I understand shit happens and pick up times may or may not be on time but I feel like a simple smile and a better attitude could have easily remedied the whole situation.,0

gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Great service; inexpensive prices; and nicely prepared meals. For those yearning for Detroit coneys; or like me; curious about what one is like after seeing them on TV; Detroit Coney Grill has exactly what you are looking for.  The menu consists of burgers; hot dogs; pitas; and salads; with some chicken and 3 vegetarian options. I decided on a Detroit coney. The hot dog had a nice \bite\"" to it from the slightly elastic casing; adding a nice textural difference from the rest of the hot dog. The chili was somewhat reminiscent of some Cincinnati style chili I've had from Skyline Chili; except with more of a savory flavor to it. It went well with the onion; mustard; and hot dog.   Service was excellent; and the owner was very friendly and came by to make sure everything was tasting OK.  Hours are a bit limited for those that tend to dine later in the evening since they close at 7:30. Overall though; a great place for some inexpensive quick eats.""",1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Excellent Dog just like Lafayette Coney in Detroit...Consistently great food and service.  Thank you for coming to Arizona!!!!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"As I walked in; immediately a familiarity washed over me. The smells; the sights of the blue; orange and white. - David introduces himself to me; and I am proud to say I live in Tucson by way of Clarkston. He gives me a white push pin to place on the map on the wall. - I feel welcomed. - normally a gal from Clarkston would be laughed at and never accepted as \from\"" Detroit; but not here. - here we are all Detroit. Here you can tell by the passion of the way David speaks on how he had to deliver the coney to these parts; if you even know someone in the mitten; you are Detroit. - I ordered 3 chili mustard onion coneys; and regular fries. -David seems saddened as I tell him it's to go because a sleeping baby and a husband in the car. - he wanted my first bite reaction in person - I order a faygo grape and he immediately opens it and allows me to have that sweet 100% cane sugar pop before I pay. A robust smile as he is satisfied by my reaction. - I am in the car; I open my dog. The aroma is right on. Reminds me of home; Kirby's; Pete's; National; and every Greek restaurant coney in between. - I notice the softeness of the steamed bun. - I bring it to my lips and the taste of fresh diced onions; sweet chili; and the snap of the dog. I question; is this a kowalski? No; maybe a koegel? Deliciousness ensues. And then it's gone. - perfect. Just like home.""",0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Awesome! Great food; friendly service; quality products. I love this place & I'll be back & refer it to my friends! Love the chili coney & Faygo soda. Fries are delicious and made fresh. Try it & you won't regret it!!!!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Right as I walked in; A very friendly owner made me mark on the map of metro Detroit where I'm from; got jealous of my 248 area code; gave me a rewards card and right as I started ordering said \you know what you're doin.\"" Needless to say; we have found our new regular spot. This place is a perfect slice of the Dirty D with all the brands and flavors from back home.""",1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,My first time here. Food was excellent as well as the service. The restaurant was pretty full only 1 open table.  The get a lot if regulars because I was the only one that didn't know the owner. Every person that walked through that door while I was there the owner knew by name. I will certainly go back again and maybe someday I will be on a first name basis with him as well. Go check it out,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,The service here is incredible. The good is always fast and delicious. Even better is the conversation and the culture. To my boyfriend; who is from Detroit; it's like going home.   My favorite is the hot fries; but they have an excellent menu with something for everyone.   The owner always remembers us and even sat down with is to talk about Detroit. Love the food and most of all; the people.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Thank God for the Detroit Coney Grill! David; the owner; is super friendly and is on top of his business. My wife & I ordered 3 Coney dogs with mustard; fresh cut onions; and topped with a sweet chili; that was a nice bean less meat sauce. The hot dogs were hot; expertly grilled; not steamed! The buns were warm; fresh and steamed. The Detroit dogs were excellent! When you bite into them; they have a nice snap. Everything was just like what we grew up eating back east in CT & MA.   We also had a bag of Detroit Better Made potato chips and 2 bottles of Faygo root beer pop. We drove down from North Scottsdale and the trip was well worth it. We do hope David can open a spot up north; closer to our home. We give it an  A+. We will come back again! Best of luck to David; the owner. Keep up the good work!,1

The hot dog and especially the fries were great!  Like In-N-Out; they don't blanch the potatoes but rather cook them all the way through at once; and in this case with the skins on and crispy without having to ask for \well done.\""  YUM!

gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,From the second you walk in you feel like family. The owner knows everyone who has been in before; even if its been a few months. The best hot dogs in town and damn good messy burgers too! Honestly just wish they had one in Mesa. But the drive is worth it for those perfect hot dogs with a snap! You can always tell the good places by the line out the door during lunch hour. But dont let the line scare you; they'll get your order out quick and it's still worth the wait.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,UNLESS you are in Michigan; you cannot get the TRUE Michigan Coney Island experience and flavored.....EXCEPT FOR DETROIT CONEY ISLAND IN TEMPE; AZ!  This place IS the real deal.....  The chili is absolutely authentic Michigan coney island recipe chili....the one you crave if you lived in Michigan and relocated....realizing they don't make it anywhere else likely they do in Michigan.  It's a state signature!    Dave and his team have brought AZ an amazing restaurant where the Greek salad;  coneys; chili; pitas and service are excellent.    If you aren't from Michigan; but want to see what the hype is about...try this place out.  It's delicious; sparkling clean; and has great service.  We have tried the other coney islands in the valley....and none of them even get close to the real deals when it comes to matching the flavor and texture of a Michigan Coney Island chili like this place does.  They make it from scratch daily.....so awesome!  We will be back!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Fabulous as always!  Back again for the irresistible chili and great Coney Dogs!  Service was perfect and so was our meal. Chicken salad was also yummy...;added feta for extra Zip.  We will be back!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place has really good food and really good prices. Good amount of food for the money always prepared fresh to order. They have a loose burger which is really good recommend trying,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,One of my Facebook friends posted about this place and I really had to give it a try so I cheated a bit on my diet and headed over. The Coneys here are really great; I only ordered one because of my diet but I REALLY wanted to eat about 3 and add some of those chili cheese fries.  When I get back in better shape I'll definitely be back for more!,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,The second time was even better!! I had their fries in addition to my coney dog and will definitely be back for a third time. The owner is extremely nice; the service is great and the food is incredibly tasty.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"What is a \Coney Dog?\""; you ask.  \""Definitely not a chili dog\"" is what has been told to me.  A real Michigan Coney Dog has an all-beef casing hot dog grilled to perfection and placed in a steamed bun.  This hot dog is topped with; and this is where it gets the distinction from a chili dog; an all meat chili; onions and mustard.    Since I LOVE to try the most I can in one order... I ordered a \""Combo Coney Dog\"".  This is the Coney dog I described above (I got my onions grilled) with \""Loose\"" meat on top of the hot dog.  What's \""loose meat\""?  Well; that's just grilled ground beef crumbled up...  They put the loose meat on top of the hot dog and then put the all meat chili on top of that.  Just dang delicious.  I really liked the taste of the hot dog itself.   Not to be out done by the hot dog; the fries here are fantastic.  I litterally watched the chef cut the potato and put the curly fries in the fryer.  The fries are just that fresh.  Oh; by the way; they grind their own meat daily for their hamburgers.  I stopped in Coney Grill to have a Faygo pop and to try the hot dog.  I grew up drinking Faygo pops when I was a kid.  Grape being my favorite flavor.  Detroit Coney Grill has Faygo pops in the bottle.  There is something about the taste of a soda out of a bottle that makes it taste 1000 times better.  I savored every cold; sweet sip.  I like this place.  I'm going back.  I'm taking some of my ex-Detroit family when they come in town.  Yummy.  This place is great!  Get there early; they close a little bit early.""",0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"I've been reading all the reviews about this place; and had it bookmarked for months.  Well; on Saturday Mr. M and I felt like goofing off and driving around aimlessly and I decided to go on a hot dog tour.    We started here and decided to adopt the attitude of \when in Rome\"" and ordered what appeared to be the house specialty; The Detroit Coney Combo with the hot dog and onions and mustard and chili and the loose ground beef all in one big pile of goodness.    First; the dude working the register has more patience than I ever would because first timers have no idea how to order here and it can be a little overwhelming in the beginning.  We got to listen to him explain things a couple of times to the group in front of us; so when he got to me; I was ready.    We shared the Detroit Coney combo and the fresh cut spiral cut fries; which come in a huge serving by the way; and I'm pretty sure they sprinkle them with crack because those are totally addictive!  Fried perfectly and absolutely delicious.  I was a little nervous that the onions and chili on the combo would come back and haunt me later; but they did not.  Everyone played nice in my belly and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable.  Combo; fries; and fountain drink was $9.18 with tax.  I'll be back for sure.""",1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,First time visiting today. You want a good hot dog? How about a great Coney Dog?! This place is legit and reminds me of places in Detroit and Toledo. I used to work at Charlie's Coney Island in Toledo. Absolutely awesome flavor and snap to the dogs. I ordered the special with hand cut fries. Wow . I ordered two Coneys to go and ended up eating them there. Today I was a pig and I cried on the way home because it was so good. Best Coney Dog I've had in 25 years!,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Of course; Detroit Coney Grill has now become the Go To place for ex pat Detroiter's who live in the Phoenix area; Detroiter's who are here on vacation or business; and Arizonans who want to enjoy this original taste from Detroit.  Af t first; we we went for the Coney Dogs and fries that have that taste of back home.  So great!  Now ; we've tried the Burgers  and they taste very similar to Greene's; Hunter House.  PLUS they have Faygo and Mexican Coke!  OMG!  The dilemma has become which to order so we order both the coneys and the burgers.  Keep up the great work David Najor and crew.  We ate there for lunch recently.  Couldn't be happier you are here.,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,My god why did it take me so long to find this place? With all the flavors of Detroit this is just like being back home. I love it! Stopped and got a Coney after I had already eaten because there was no way that I was going to let this opportunity pass me by. I ordered a coney and a Faygo rock-n-rye. It tasted just like I had ordered from duly's on w Vernor and junction. A true taste of Detroit indeed. Definitely going back for more. It's a must for true Detroiters wanting that true Detroit taste. The best part was meeting the owner and finding your he knew my neighborhood in southwest Detroit. I will be supporting this spot for years to come!,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Best thing to come out of Detroit since Robocop.  This new fast-casual burger and dog joint looks like it might as well be a seasoned chain; but it's a new concept in a formerly failing strip. This and the neighboring restaurant; Hummus Xpress; have resurrected this location from the dead.   The food here is fantastic. Everything seems fresh and high quality. Even though the prices are fast-food low; you're definitely getting a lot of bang for your buck. The owner is pretty nice and has a lot of experience running local restaurants. He's usually there and he is very proud (as he should be) of his place and happy to tell you all about what you're eating and how they grind their own meat for the burger patties. That's always a good sign for me - an owner and staff who give a shit about their restaurant.   I ate a double cheeseburger with bacon and avocado and paired it with some curly fries. It was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley. If you're a big fan of In and Out Burger or Five Guys; you should really give this place a try because it's not only better; it blows those places away. You can get your burger topped with just about whatever you want; and after you order you can watch them disassemble a whole potato and toss it in some hot oil for you.   Don't be intimidated or discouraged if you see a long line out the door at lunchtime because it moves really fast; and the register is up near the door so that's gonna happen. Rumor has it that they might start offering delivery soon after lunch. Makes me wish I lived a little closer. With the kind of detail and thought that went into this concept; they might have plans to open more locations eventually - looking forward to that.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Amazing food and excellent service! They even have sodas and other Detroit native foods! Whether you're from Michigan; or just a fan of great food; this place MUST be on your list. Definitely check them out!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,First the quality of the dog was pretty good...probably one of the best I've come across recently.  The chili was ok...not great; not bad.  Like many places that cook fresh cut fries they're just a tad underdone.  There's a right way to do it (pre cook and then a final cook) and the not right way...this place like most others opt for the not right way.  Ordered the fries as chili cheese fries.  The cheese was that cheese like substance that you get at the movies...not good.  Overall good; but improvements are in order.  With all of the above I'd still go back; albeit no fries.  UPDATE 12/5/13 -- I've been told that there are different cheese selections for the chili cheese fries other that the liquid type (shredded and sliced).  That information makes a big difference (in my mind) in the quality of chili cheese fries.  That piece of information warrants an upgrade from a 3 star to a 4 star (they were on the border before; but help doesn't go in half point increments).,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Woo-hoo!  They're open!  Now I can get my Detroit food fix in Arizona!  First thing you see when you walk in is the decor and employees are all in Detroit colors; orange and blue.  You can buy the t-shirts too I think.  The menu is pretty simple; burgers and dogs. Pita sandwiches and salads; fries; chips and drinks.  They have several flavors of Faygo soda pop for $2.25 and bags of Better Made Potato Chips.  There is no Sanders Hot Fudge or ice cream of any kind.  No desserts that I saw at all.  I ordered the regular Coney Dog; $3.95 which came with Chili and onions; an order of the hand cut French fries to split; and Faygo (\Which way diddee go!?\"") Root Beer.  My daughter got a Breaded Chicken Tenderloin \""Hani\"" Pita Sandwich and also a root beer.  The minute I bit into a French fry and tasted how delicious it was; I walked up to the counter; told the guy; \""I'm not sharing those so we'd better get another order!\"". They tasted like my Mother's homemade ones!   The Coney Dog looked a little small on first view; but I bit into the hot dog and it almost audibly popped! Scrumptious juices exuded from it.  This is no ordinary hot dog.  Warning: It's messy.    The root beer bottle was kind of tepid; not ice cold; maybe just because they had such a rush of business on Opening Day that they couldn't keep up with the demand? I took my water glass; filled with ice and poured the drink over it; solving the problem.    The owner is very nice.  He and all the employees are all from various parts of Michigan.  I'm from Livonia; suburb of Detroit; myself.  I had heard about this Grand Opening at another Detroit themed place; Sunshine Motor City Cafe; and I think it is great that we ex-Michiganders have more than one place now to go get that back-home feeling; even if it is 113° outside!""",0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,In the state of Michigan there exists a particular type of hot dog known as a coney. Why is it called a coney? No one knows. As far as I know it's not named after Coney Island in New York. It's not named after the SNL sketch turned 90s movie the Coneheads either; and it's not named after Joseph Kony the leader of the Ugandan resistance movement.   What is a Coney hot dog you might be asking? Well it's a hot dog with a chilli; mustard and onion. This differs a bit from a regular chilli dog due to the mustard to balance out the chilli flavor.   And this brings me to Detroit Coney Grill; while in the metropolitan Phoenix area I checked around with local yelpers to help me track down hot dog places to review and this was one of those recommendations. So one afternoon I set my sights on visiting Detroit Coney Grill and giving it a try.  The restaurant itself has a fair bit of seating available with one long counter encompassing both where you order and where your food is prepared. I went for a coney dog and water and within a few minutes my food was ready and it was time to dig in. The hot dog had a lot of very nice tasting meaty chilli on it; the combination of the chilli mixed with the mustard was nice and the sausage itself tasted good. This was a skinless sausage on a regular seedless bun. There were a lot of diced onions on top that added to the mix. Overall this was an excellent combination of ingredients and a very satisfying hot dog.   If I had to complain about anything it's that it was a tad pricey; it was a little over 4.00 for the hot dog and a cup of water. I will say that this was a far better tasting hot dog with chilli as the primary ingredient than the one I had at Ted's also located in Tempe Arizona; but for the same price roughly I got a footlong there. Overall I'd say my food was excellent but the value was a little lacking. I am going to give Detroit Coney Grill a solid four stars and a recommendation.,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Best coney and cheese fries I've ever had!! Fries are made from fresh potatoes.   Excellent service!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Love the owner; has the east coast persuasion! lol Food-Fast;Fatty anddd Fabolous! Had the quad cheeseburger love the meat plenty of it and chesse melt beautifully! Partner had the philly on pita! YASSS! Hot food; great service; MUST TRY! Thank you I will be back soon when I need a burger or philly! Only thing-stay open later I know the college kids will come all hours of the night!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Detroit Coney makes you feel like you are home. The fast; friendly service is unlike most businesses out West. What really sets them apart is the 1st name basis/memorization the owner has for every customer who walks through the door. he converses with everyone; makes sure you have everything you need; and that you enjoyed your meal. He has the true midwest respect that is hard to find out here. The food tastes like it was made fresh and sent here in a matter of minutes straight from downtown Detroit! coney's taste like coney's; burgers/sliders taste like something out of White Castle; and the best part is they have Faygo POP! I could go on and on about this place and the feeling of home you get walking through the front door!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,The guys here at DCG have some serious passion for the Coney Dog and the action they have going on is pretty cool as well. Inside is full of fun items to make you feel like you're back in the Detroit area and then some. Take your time and check out the walls.  I've never been to Michigan but do love THE DOG. Been here a couple times and usually order a couple of their famous Coney Combos. Even broke down and had to test out some of the Chili Cheese Fries. Nice!  Really like the way the Dog pops in your mouth as you bite into them. The Hand Cut Fries are made fresh to order and you can definitely tell the difference. They also have Burgers; Pitas; Salads and boneless Chicken Wings as well.  The food is pretty good and most people seem to rate this place rather high. I'm inclined to go with an A-OK since the Chili or Coney sauce just did not have much of a thrill factor or flavor profile for me and the hotdogs are little on the pricey side.  Give them a try and see what you think. This is one of those regional flavors that you are going to enjoy more if you are from that area. I tend to lean toward the Windy City when hankering for a special treat. BEEP BEEP!  3.5 STARS,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,5 Star Food and Service ! Close your eyes and you are back in Detroit enjoying a fantastic coney dog or a smothered hamburger; don't forget the fresh fries and drinks from Detroit.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Great place to eat; stopped here while I was in the area was a little skeptical but boy was I wrong very good flavor... I am a very picky and plain eater and they have a very simple menu and can whip up almost anything for you; amazing customer service Dave is the best I can already tell.   Live in Mesa let's get a location out here!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was welcoming as soon as I stepped thru the door. The owner David greeted me with a smile and a push pin to put on a map of Detroit to say where I was from. I ordered a faygo red; two bags of better made red hot chips cause there is no other chips like them. A coney dog with grilled onions and chilli chesse fries. The coney dog was good but not over flowing as you would get back home where it was mandatory to eat your coney dog with a fork. I was able to pick up my dog and eat it with it Going all over my fingers; which is a part of a great coney dog. I do want to try the curly fries that they make right in front of you and maybe a burger.  I do have to say that I had walked by a guy eating a double burger and the look on his face was that of pure bliss. The owner David casually walked among his customers and I casually ask for a picture. He did not hesitate in obligeing me. We went outside and took a pic in front of his eatery's logo. Overall; absolutely a place to go eat. Ground meat is made right there and looked delicious.  I was ok with my coney dog and chilli chesse fries but in think I was more jazzed about having a faygo red. Even as I was walking out the door I got a I really hope you enjoyed the food. Great atmosphere.  Next to try burger and red hot fries.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"There is a sign by the cash register.  It reads; essentially; as follows: \If you order a SODA; we'll give you a POP.\""  At this point I knew I was in good company.  Ordered two Detroit Coney Dogs; fresh cut fries and a Faygo Root Beer.  Pure Michigan right there.  The dogs were first class.  Meat was quality and the chili top notch.  The hefty batch of fresh cut fries made for the perfect side and; needless to say; Faygo delivered with their quality root beer.    If you're a Michigan transplant; this is the place for you.  Even if you have to travel a bit.  A taste from home is well worth it.""",0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,After my first visit to Detroit Coney Grill; I was hesitant to leave a 5-star review. I wanted to be more objective and wondered if I wasn't wearing homer goggles. After multiple visits it's clear that Detroit Coney Grill is legit. Everything I've ordered has been top notch. The coney dogs; the loose burgers and the classic burgers and; of course; the fresh cut fries (go Cajun style!). They do it all and they do it greatly. You will not find a better coney dog in the valley. It does not matter where you are from; the food is fantastic. Detroit Coney Grill has become one of my favorite dining spots in the valley. This is also the only place I know of where I can order food and wipe my feet on an Ohio State rug (the homer in me loves this).,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place is so bomb!! I had the chicken philly with jalapeños and it was everything I wanted for my cheat day! Not only was the food on point; the customer service was as well. The guy at the counter was super friendly and gave me his recommendations for the menu. It was my first time there; and I can promise that I will be back!!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,OMG...just like the original coneys in Detroit! !  We drove from Maricopa. ..we'd love one there!   Out of the park on this restaurant!   Well priced and fast service! !  On a scale of 1-10...at least a 15!!!   Hats off to a great place...parking lot and dining room...standing room only!,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place is amazing! The food tastes just like it was made in Detroit. And the service? Completely friendly! I would recommend this place to Michigan natives and anyone who has never had a coney dog before. You will definitely be back for more!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place is great!  Excellent service; excellent atmosphere and more than anything else; the food is excellent.  Having grown up in the Detroit area; I know about Coney Islands all too well.  This food is authentic and right up there with the classic Coney Islands in Detroit.  We will definitely be back.  I cannot wait til the now location is open as it is closer to me in North Phoenix. I am so glad that they also carry Vernors; Faygo and Better Made chips!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Within the restaurants of a 5 mile radius from where I work; Detriot Coney is one of the most delicious; cheapest and offers the best service.  I went there for a dog but I saw someone eating a juicy burger so I changed my mind.  Drink; fries and a delicious cheeseburger for all under $8 bucks.  The person who took my order explained that my burger order number will be called out and then they will ask me what fixings I want \like subway\"" he said.  I thought that was a pretty cool feature and they had a nice selection of burger toppings.  The guy who cooked my burger; served it to me at my table and then cleaned up my table when I was done; what a superstar employee.  I'm giving this place 5 stars because it was clean; the service was awesome and the food was very delicious.  For a hot dog stand this place is a cut above the rest!""",1

gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Seriously; when I walk through the front door of Detroit Coney Grill; I feel like I am back in Detroit. From the smells; the tastes; the menu offerings and everyone's friendly demeanor; from the staff to the patrons. They need a sign on the wall when you walk in that says. \If You're From Detroit; Welcome Home!\""  I'm originally from Oak Park; Michigan (a suburb of Detroit) and two of the things I miss the most are the food and the general kindness with which people treat each other there. Found out the owner (Dave? David?) is also from Oak Park (and used to live about 5 blocks from where I used to live!). They have regular hot dogs there and they have Coney's. The Coney is a hot dog with a natural casing; so it 'snaps' when you bite into it. My wife and I have driven to the famous Pink's hotdogs in Hollywood and had great chili dogs there; and this place stacks right up against them in every way!  The coney's are amazing. The fries are made just the way I make them at home myself. The people that work there and eat there are all very friendly and love to talk about reminiscing where we're all from and if you remember this place or that place back in the day back home (Detroit).  What a great place! Good prices; hours are kinda weird (closes at 7:30pm on weekdays and closed on Sundays) and it can be a little difficult to find as its smashed into the middle of a crowded strip mall with a medical marijuana license distributor a few stores down.  We made the trip from Glendale to try this place out and I was so impressed! I wish it was closer! But I predict I'll be making the drive again soon - and often! (Update - I've been there four times now and it seems like it just keeps getting better every time I go. Food is consistently great and people are consistently friendly and the service is consistent as well).  Loved having Vernor's in the glass bottle; and looking forward to trying the burgers next time; as well. (Update - we tried the sliders; which are a menu option only offered on certain days - they were amazing!)  They also just started offering Boston Coolers on the menu on Friday's and Saturday's. For those who don't know or remember; a Boston Cooler is Vernors blended with French Vanilla ice cream (almost like a root beer float). It is so good - and if you've never had one; I guarantee it tastes like nothing else you've ever had (in a good way!).  Trivia - Why is it called a Boston Cooler when it's from Detroit? It was named after Detroit's Boston Boulevard where it was reportedly first served. The history of the Boston Cooler has some conflicts. One story says that Mr. Sanders invented the drink at his store on the east side of Woodward Ave near Boston Blvd. The other story; and the one I like better; is that the drink was invented during Prohibtion by Grandpa Vernor for his grandchildren. According to legend; there was a milk man who delivered to the Vernor household. In his wagon he carried Strohs Ice Cream (Strohs had to give up brewing beer and changed their fire-brewed kettles over to ice cream production). James Vernor Sr. lived on Grosse isle but would visit the grandkids in Detroit. During one summer visit in 1921 the milkman and Grandpa Vernor delevoped a friendship and between the two of them they concocted the mixture of Strohs vanilla ice cream and Vernors Ginger Ale. It was called a Boston Cooler because the house was on Boston Blvd.  Detroit Coney Grill is a great place! Highly Recommended! Hidden Gem!!!  Also; I just learned they are getting ready to open another location on the west side of town (maybe 35th Ave and Bell Road?) That's a lot closer to my house; so I'm sure I will be eating there more often!  Disclaimer - I am not an investor; I did not know anyone who works there or runs the place (though I am getting to know them) nor do I have anything to gain (or lose) by posting this review.""",1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Uh-maze-ing!!! Originally from michigan now living in Seattle visiting family in phoenix. Came in; to visit family and HAD to come in to check it out. Great service friendly welcome line out the door the entire experience.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Wow! Fabulous ambiance and service. The food was amazingly good. I will keep going and going here until I am too fat to fit through the door. Yup! It is that good.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Top notch food and service..wife and I drove from uptown and well worth the effort! Will definitely be back!!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Food is great; Customer Service is just as great... glad I found the spot... Props to you fellaz...,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Here is a place you must visit if you are from Detroit and live in the Valley of the Sun.  When you walk in the door you feel like you have arrived back in Motown.  The first order of business is the map and pins.  Here you are able to place a pin on your home town.  The Better Made Chips and Faygo are a must along side the Coney Dog.  I am especially fond of the \loose\"" which is a bun; onion and chili.  I honestly did not expect to find it here and was pleasantly surprised.  If you are in the mood for some home town cuisine this is a diamond in the rough.""",0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,The place was good as far as customer service. The owner is a nice guy and treats you like a friend. Its funny...he had a restaurant called WIndy City Cafe and claimed to be from Chicago...now he's claiming to be from Detroit.  Honestly didn't like the food. We were still hungry and wanting a hotdog that we drove over to Wiener Schnitzel.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Yay Detroit Coney Grill listens to their customers! Sliced beets on the Greek Salads! Great service great food!!!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,If you are from Michigan and you are trying to get your Coney fix; this place is exactly what you are looking for. I lived in Michigan for a year and had my share of Coney's and Detroit Coney Island hits the spot. I live in North Phoenix and make it a point to drive into Tempe once a month to get my Coney.   The owner is super nice and his staff shows excellent customer service. I can only hope that he opens a store closer to camelback and central so I don't have to travel so far to grab a Coney;),1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place reminds me of home. One of the best things about this place is the service. As soon as we opened the door; the staff greeted us with a smile and a hello. Of course I had to order two Detroit Coney Dogs; that was a given. The hot dog itself is awesome; nice skin that snaps as you bit into it. Great tasting chili and a generous amount of onions and mustard in a perfectly steamed bun. The fries are cut on site and are really tasty. With Better Maid chips and Faygo pop; it is probably the perfect meal. The owner David came out and talked with my family and I; got us set up with the loyalty program (which we will be using a lot). Great atmosphere; great food; great drink... we will be back!  The only negative feedback I have on the place is just something personal. I am not a fan of the tip cup for the cooks. But that is just me; some people like them; some people don't see anything wrong with them; to each their own.  I think everyone should eat at Detroit Coney Grill and take a friend with you!,1

gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,I moved to Arizona about two years ago from Michigan and every time I would visit home I had to go to a Coney Island to get my fix... Now it's not as necessary since we finally have one here!!! And let me tell you; it's the real deal. We met the owner our first visit; he's an awesome guy from Michigan with a real love for what he does. He imports the coney dogs straight from Detroit; along with Faygo & Better Made chips!  I got the Hani; which I usually get in Michigan; and it tasted exactly the same!!!! I can't tell you how happy I was! I've been to restaurants who try to mock the Hani or imitate it slightly... It's always a let down. But the Hani at Detroit Coney Grill: LEGIT!! I overheard the guy at the table next to me (also a fellow Michigander) say how awesome the coney dogs are too. How could they not be; though? They're straight from the D!!! I plan on trying everything on the menu and I plan on being extremely satisfied with it all as well. ;) The atmosphere is fun & filled with Detroit pride. It's also very clean! There were tons of Michigan people there too; which is always fun to talk to fellow Michiganders with that Midwest; humble mentality. The service was great - everyone who works there is super nice!! Quick too! The owner was chatting with us for a while when we were there which was really nice. You can tell he just wants to see his customers happy. It's nice to finally have a little piece of Michigan here in Arizona! I can't wait to come back!!! I'm bringing all my friends too; to show them Michigan knows what's up when it comes to good food! :),1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Found this place while waiting for car to get repaired; awesome food; service and prices! Calling their regulars by name.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place is AWESOME!!! Great food; friendly staff; good value. Only knocks I have are the place needs to be larger and the self service area could be better. But that's a problem in a lot of places.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Love eating here!  We grew up in the suburbs of Detroit and miss our Hani's from National.  We've been waiting a long time for someone to come out here and open a restaurant like this!  Excellent service and good food; what more can you ask for!  Hope to see them closer to my home in Chandler/Gilbert in the future!  Now all we need to do is find a good pizza place to replace Buddy's/Loui'.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Very good food! Our table ordered hotdogs; hamburgers; and fries (plain fries; cheese; and chili-cheese fries).

gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,First time here at Detroit Coney Grill. Here's my review.....  Service: 5/5 the staff is VERY friendly and accommodating; everyone went out of their way to greet us and make us feel welcomed. (:  Food: 4/5 my mom got the gyro and I got a coney no onion; and we shared fries. The hotdog really does have a great snap to it. Fries are hand cut and fresh.   Great neighborhood spot; will come back again.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,I've died and gone to DETROIT. This is it folks; finally...Lafayette style original old school Detroit coney dogs like I remember it; right here in Tempe!!  Better Made chips; Faygo Rock & Rye; snappy dogs; and incredible service by an owner who's dedicated to keeping it real. If you love dogs; you have to come. So. Damn. Delicious.  Now...just open one in Ahwatukee at 48th n Warner! Please? ;-),1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Friendly service and great food. Just like Detroit Coney. Love that you guys sell Faygo Rock n' Rye. We will definitely be back soon.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Great place.  More of a 41/2.  Came in a couple days ago and had the special of 2 coney dogs and a drink for 8-9 bucks.  Also ordered the loose meat sandwich and chili fries.  Everything was awesome.  The natural soda brand from MI they carried was outstanding stuff too.  Of course; they call it pop.  The owner and staff were super nice guys and we look forward to going back.  They're thinking about opening another location so hopefully it will be in Gilbert near San Tan Mall.  Hint hint.  We live right by there.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,I live in Chandler; Az.  My fiance has been raving about this hot dog joint for months now. Finally he took me here earlier this week.  First thing I noticed is how friendly and upbeat the guys are that work here. (Owner perhaps; super nice. Even came by our table to make sure everything was to our liking) I ordered a double cheeseburger and my guy had a Detroit coney combo. Man; they were both awesome! I loved the crunch the dog had and also the chili was amazing! The burger was delicious too! We will definitely be coming back. Hopefully they can open a new joint up in the Chandler area. Enjoy!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,The best coneys in town; even better than Portillo's and I normally like Chicago style dogs but can't beat my hometown version....owner is great and treats all his customers like his best friend; old school personable service!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Temporary fix for a Midwest staple. I've been here in Arizona for a little over 5 years . Moving from Detroit I stayed eating at a Coney Island at least one meal of the day. So when I heard of the Detroit coney grill I was very excited; an to find out that they were getting their chilli from one of the best if not oldest coneys in Detroit; made it Mir appealing. When I told my wife that there was a coney in the valley we decided to check it out. When we made if to the location I knew I was in the right place. Several people leaving the place with their Detroit tigers fitted I felt at home for a quick second. The vibe inside was nice; some photos on the wall of certain Michigan team an a few other things Detroit. So now we get to the food which is really the reason that we came. Unlike most of the other people who have given reviews I was somewhat unimpressed by the menu as well as pricing an hours. Understand this; I am Detroit in every way shape an form. I've said on many occasions that if there were a coney out here that was exactly how we have them back home you would have a winner. Although the food is nice here; it's menu is missing so much that would make this a great place to go. I don't want to just go to a spot because its reminds me somewhat of home. And I think that this is what's happening with this place. So many people from Michigan have moved out here to the valley that anytime that you hear of anything from home you want to check it out. Coneys are a 24/7 grill with sooooo much to choose from on the menu you sometimes stand at the counter trying hard to make a decision on what to get. Burgers an coney fries are nice however just a scratch of the surface. And 2 bucks for a faygo is highway robbery; especially when you can go to certain qts or circle k's an get a 20 oz for 1 buck. The guy told us that they charge that much because it cost so much to send them out here. I know some may see this as a raggin rant; however it's not. In order to stand the test of time with a business you have to look at everything your patrons are saying an try to make adjustments. If not that same thing can turn around and bite you. Hopefully this is just a start to a great establishment in the valley. I'll be back to see if anything has changed. #whatupdoe,0
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,I am SO incredibly impressed with the service here. My boyfriend and I visited on a Friday evening. The owner was working and greeted us immediately. I showed him my check in on yelp and he gave us 10% off our order. I truly appreciate that he went over the menu with us; explained the history of the Detroit Coney Grill; described what meat cuts they use and type of dogs they order. He also sold me on the Faygo Rock & Rye soda. Let me just tell you.... YUM. It's a soda made with pure cane sugar (my favorite). David even let me try it before I purchased it just to make sure I liked it.   The food was really tasty as well. I had a Coney Dog and it was delicious. The guys that served and delivered the food to our table were also helpful and made sure we liked everything. It is not every day that you see an owner and his staff take such pride in their work. I am typically so disappointed in the customer service in most retail and restaurants anywhere I go; but it is such a breath of fresh air to see that David is doing his best to remedy that in his establishment.   If only there was a Coney Grill out in Chandler/Gilbert. :) Soon hopefully!,1

gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place was awesome! The food was fanatic; the service was amazing; the atmosphere is fun and I totally can't wait to come back. Open up a place in central Phoenix! The staff were super friendly and the price is really good for the amount of food you get!,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Found DCG by accidentally and LOVED IT! The coneys are great; but  the burgers are amazing. I've been bringing co-workers here for lunch; and it's become an office favorite. Now; we try to come at least once a week.  The service is impeccable. The owner; Dave; truly seems to care about the food and his customers. He personally takes the orders; makes recommendations and greets every table. Plus; they are FAST! At times; my order is done fresh before I even get my drink.  If you haven't been; make a point to stop by. You won't be disappointed!,1

gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,I love this place.  From the first visit; I knew this was a joint I would frequent whenever I come to town for work.  In fact; I have my coworker addicted to this place now.  We decided that since this place is so great; it's on the short list of places to go with the company cool kids secret club.    The customer service is great; like really great.  The owner is helladope.  He always has an exuberant greeting; handshake; or hug for me whenever I come in.  The guys behind the counter are always super friendly and helpful.  Didn't know you needed a spoon and ketchup?...don't fret; they knew you did and they'll bring it to you.  The prices are low.  You can fill yourself up to bursting for less than twenty bucks.  There are quite a few things on the menu; but why would you get anything other than the Detroit Coney?  The hot dogs are great.  You know you're eating a good dog when it snaps when you bite into it.  The onions could be a little bit more oniony for me with just a little bit more bite to 'em.  The chili-fries are so so good.  I can feel my arteries clogging with every delicious bite and if I have a fat-girl heart attack on the way out of the door; it'll be worth it.  They also carry a bunch of Faygo; but you need not paint on your ICP face to have any.  I've had a few other things; but it's really all about the hot dogs and fries.,1
gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"What is it that makes this place so special? I had the Combo Coney Dog; that isn't chili dog..  and it did nothing to me. Hot-dogs are substandard food no matter how much you pay for it. And the chili on top was no culinary experience at all. it made my hot-dog bun soggy. It had no great flavor; nor was in special in any fashion.   The service is good though.. just a little too much Disney over the whole \we're so genuine\"". I find it parodying true home pride.. and not in a good way. It looks clean but it is a fast food place; and I am trying to figure out what it is that people like with this place. The food isn't anything special. There is no ambiance to speak of. So what is it? They are nce here; they are. But it becomes a theme park kinda thing. \""We have all this Genuine Detroit kinda hot dogs and stuff\""... Ohyeah; looks and taste like normal hot-dog to me.  (I was leaning to the cheese fries. in my mind it would be fries slightly overdone; a hint of vinegar and topped with some interesting hard cheese flavor. But instead it is same fries w nacho cheese (you know the crap you cannot legally refer to as cheese). I didn't try it. I saw it. So happy i didn't go that route.)  Yes; they sell some stuff like Faygo that is good and all; but all-in-all you pay for a meal that's suppose to reflect something that doesn't really exists. It's a hot dog stand with a gimmick.  A gimmick that I can't even grasp. That is it - and promoting the emperors new clothes is not my thing.   Best part of my meal - overpriced Faygo. I will not suggest to come back here.""",1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,I'm really disappointed in this location.  The last two times I've been here they haven't had the kind of meat I wanted ready.  This Thursday night at 9:20 they didn't have any steak for my burrito.  The guy said it would be ready in about eight minutes.  I told him I'd come back another time and walked out.  This Saturday at 11:30 AM I was in and asked the order taker for chicken tacos.  We both looked at the container that should have had chicken and it was empty.  The lady said it would be about 4 minutes until it was ready.  I waited and got my tacos and they were good.  I think I'll give them a while to get their act together here before I come back.,0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,Never really had a problem with this chipotle But had a terrible experience today. Employees were super rude from start to finish. Awful customer service. The lady at the end started rolling my burrito before I was even finished ordering. Never asked if I wanted anything else. Brought it home and right as I began to eat I noticed a decent sized black line on my tortilla - sharpie. Avoided the entire middle of my burrito. Sharpie isn't toxic but it's still not good to ingest. Disappointing because this chipotle is very close to my house. But it isn't much farther to go to 90th and Shea. I will not be returning to this location.,0

XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,"We go to Chipotle almost every day; today at this location there was no veggies; beans or meats prepared; we had to kill some time at AJ's and come back to find still no prepared food ready!!!  Lady fixing our bowls couldn't even speak English; got our orders wrong and after being given less than the normal serving size on our bowls; including the guac we pay extra for; Sally the cashier or manager; argued with us loudly regarding the portion sizes.  She said \I could stand here and argue about his with you all day\""!  Wow!  We were appalled!  Bathrooms and restaurant floors a complete disaster.  Place was a mess and Sally does not belong in customer service.  We are huge chipotle fans and we were treated with a completely unprofessional attitude.  Sure hope Chipotle reads these reviews.  Lose Sally or lose our business and I'm sure we are not the first to feel that way; or last.""",0

XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,If the food weren't so good; this Chipotle would represent my idea of one of the nine circles of Hell.  Enter on the wrong weekday evening during peak dinner hours; and you will feel like you're stuck in the middle of a daycare center.  Little kids run around as if they're in a McDonald's Play Place; but since there is no play area; they're just running around the restaurant.  If you're picking up food at this time; do yourself a huge favor and order it online to-go.  The 27 minute line (I'm not exaggerating; I timed it on my cellphone) is to be expected at 6:30 on a Wednesday night; but the crammed crowd and noise was pretty hard to bare.  Parking is also a regular pain at this shopping center.  I am not a kid hater.  I also understand that these issues are not entirely Chipotle's fault (which is why the place still gets four stars).  It's the parents job to keep their kids in line and it would be a PR nightmare for any company to try to do something about it.  But if you perfer to be in an environment without children running around like it's recess; then you may want to give another location a try.  There's quite a few other Chipotles just a couple of miles away.  The saving grace is my love for Chipotle's food.  It's the one fast-food option my girlfriend and I regularly agree on when we're too lazy to cook and not in the mood to dine out.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  The extra charge for stuff like guacamole is annoying.  But Chipotle delivers great food at a good price; so I'm more than willing to put up with the headaches to get my delicious burrito.,0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,"Worst chipotle location ever.  Rude employees; slow line; ALWAYS out of something you have to wait for and if I have to say \more please\"" one more time I'll scream. They always under portion the meat and forget to give you the drink you ordered. The only reason I come here is cause it's literally right across the street from where I live.... :/""",0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,I come here a couple times a week for lunch or dinner; and I've never had a bad experience. The food is good; and the service is great.  I'm not sure of his name; but there is one guy; who appears to be the owner or manager; who is always very friendly and welcoming who occasionally works the line. The other workers don't go out of their way to be very friendly; but it's not like they are rude.  It's probably one of the better Chipotles I've been to; in terms of service and food; and I've been to plenty (even out of state).,1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,Every time I come here; the GM is super awesome. He introduced himself awhile back; and now we're on a first name basis. Not sure if that's a sign that I go too often or great customer service (maybe a little of both).  As for the food itself; It's definitely not; 'Authentic' Mexican food; but for Mexican Fast food fix; this sure does beat Taco Bell. It's always fresh; and I'm a huge fan of the HOT sauce and lime salt chips they have there. I'm literally in between two locations; one off of Shea and another off Frank Lloyd Wright and whenever I'm looking to feed my Chipotle fix; I make sure to migrate to this one.,1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,Chipotle is a great place i think if you want to eat healthy; this particluar one is close to my house; the food is very good; but its the service that gets me sometimes; i always order special things on my burrito and its a bit complicated; usually at other chipotles the person making the burrito is nice and does it with a smile; at this one they always seem so impatient and fast and when i ask for my special requests they seem a bit upset!,0

XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,When I'm craving Mexican Food; I always get tempted by Chipotle to stop by and grab a Steak Burrito.  That's exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago....I couldn't shake the image of a delicious Steak Burrito; so I dropped by this location to satisfy my craving.  When I arrived; there were 6 people ahead of me however it didn't take too long for the line to move.  I ordered my usual here....Steak Burrito w/Rice; Pinto Beans; Cheese; Guacamole; Sour Cream; and the Spiciest Salsa.  It only took a few seconds after sitting down for me to take a bite.....yep; it was just as good as I had imagined.  My all day craving was finally satisfied!  Needless to say; I devoured that bad boy in no time.  Overall; it was a pleasant experience at Chipotle.  I like this location and will definitely return.  Return  Factor - 95%,0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,Time for a review update.  After we moved to the area a few years ago; this location is the closest to my neighborhood.  From the first time I dined here until today; it's delivered consistent food quality and customer service.  The lines can get long during the lunch rush; so I like to come here before 11 am or after 1 pm to beat the long lines.  The only downside to this restaurant is the parking situation.  The parking lot of the shopping center it's located in gets packed; so it's often difficult to find a space close to the restaurant.  That sucks when it's 110 degrees out in the middle of the Summer.  Despite that inconvenience; I still come back.  Return Factor - 85%,1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,This restaurant has been going downhill. The last time I was there the food I got was sloppy and cold.  The chicken was chewy and disgusting. I contacted the company and they were very slow in responding.  They promised to send two gift cards for the disappointing service and only sent one.  I don't think I'll bother going again.,0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,I eat at Chipotle almost every day and usually visit the location by the Scottsdale Quarter and experience great service. This location however has poor service and they had their staff using their left hands to scoop smaller portion sizes; really?? They give you like 5 small cubes of meat and tiny portions of beans etc... This is not good service..  They need to step up to the plate and give service that is expected at a Chipotle franchise. Needless to say I will never visit this location again. By the way everyone that has experienced the same service there is relief close by at Grayhawk with another Chipotle location.,0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,Chipotle is great for a quick lunch. I like their concept and the rapid order/eat system. It's not much for ambiance but likely healthier than most fast food around.,1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,This store rocks; Victor the cashier always has a smile and the girls on the front line know my order by heart...couldn't ask for better customer service !,1

XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,"I like Chipotle; but they've got to make some changes for my tastes.  First; the salsas are lacking.  Can a brother get a salsa selection without red onion?  Red onion smell like Sasquatches cornhole; I cannot STAND those things.  Maybe lean back towards more traditional salsas like tomatillo or perhaps roasted Hatch.  Oftentimes; I'll order a burrito sans salsa and just add my own at home.  Secondly; what the hell is this; Subway Sandwiches at lunchtime?  I know speed is of the essence but haste makes waste; baby!  If you arrive at Chipotle at a busy hour; they're going to make a murderous mess of your burrito.   Split tortillas; tortillas soggy with the liquids from the beans; cross-contaminated filler (ooh!  Look!  It's a chicken-barbacoa fusion!)  Fast casual; I can appreciate.  Food made screamingly fast can really wreck the end product so please; I know you need me at the cash register and out of your way for the next customer; but for the love of Grog; take your time and let's work on \First Quality\"".  And let's have some traditional salsa options.  Red onions suck.  Even the guacamole has an overabundance.""",0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,"Frequented this place for lunch when out on this side of town and it's always fast; fresh and easy. This place packs up quickly for lunch - so I would recommend heading here no later than 11:30 a.m. or after 1 p.m. if you need to be back to work at a certain time.  You can always order online and just grab-and-go if you need to!  The parking lot can be the tricky part of eating here; with a little bit of an awkward set-up and several different popular things right next to each other and people competing to get \the best spot.\"" Again; lunch time is the worst time for the craziness.  The line moves really quickly since the employees are efficient but still manage to keep a smile and treat customers in a friendly manner. We'll for sure be back for good food here.""",1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,Worst Chipotle I've ever been to. They skimp on everything to the point you think it's a joke. We kept going back thinking it was just a fluke; continues to happen. Also whether there's a line or not; the service is really slow.   They literally sprinkle everything; to the point they make a normal scoop and then pour most of it back.   Will be going to the 92nd/Shea location from now on.,0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,"You go in here at pretty much any time of the day and you would swear that they were giving away free food... the lines are so damn long!   The burritos or bowls are good. The proteins are always pretty fresh... as you can see the staff cooking them right over the prep line.  Today's trip was slightly disappointing because several items I wanted were almost depleted in the serving pans; and I wouldn't let them use the \dregs\"" on my burrito.   Be careful ordering the guacamole: It's a $1.50 for a \""scoop\"".   My tips: Try one of their Margaritas! They are interestingly pretty potent!""",0
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,A great lunch spot if you hit them during the non-peak hours.  I recommend trying around either 11:30 or waiting until after 1 p.m. to get some great eats here.  Standard Chipotle fair; and the service is fast; efficient and very friendly.    I also recommend their online ordering service.  Pick your meal from the comfort of your desk; select a time; and even pay if you want to.  The food is ready to go when you arrive and all you have to do is walk straight to the front cashier and take it away!  Overall: A Great lunch spot for some good food.  Try online ordering.  Parking lot can get packed at peak times!,1

XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,I have been to this Chipotle a few times for both lunch and dinner. Additionally; my company has ordered catering from here. During the lunch rush; per the norm; they are super busy with a line out the door. The shopping complex they inhabit has a lot of parking; but during lunch time it is a mad house and it can be extremely difficult finding a parking space. Once inside; ordering is normally very smooth. First; you must decide on your meal - burrito; salad; tacos; or burrito bowl. Then; pick your meat or the new vegetarian option.  Next; pick your rice and other toppings. Finally; choose a drink and pay. It's very fast and efficient.  Great for a quick and extremely filling lunch.,1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,When my brother and our friend Ron asked if I wanted to join them for lunch today; I said yes before I realized where they were going... I was super hungry! Although I've been to Chipotle just a couple of times before; I have to say; I'm not as big a fan as everyone else seems to be.  Reason being - both their corn relish and chunky salsa have a ton of onions in them... yuck!  But; I was hungry and needed some quick fuel; so I decided to tag along with the boys. I will admit; that for fast food; Chipotle doesn't seem so bad.  I ordered the chicken salad and although I would've liked some corn or tomato salsa without onions; the rest of the options were tasty; especially the guac!  I will agree with Zack that Steve; the new GM; and Sam; his apprentice; treated us like VIPs.  Never before have I been approached by the GM at a fast food restaurant like that.  (Then again; I rarely eat fast food).  Needless to say; it was impressive. If I need some quick food; I won't hesitate to return to Chipotle; it grew on me quite a bit today!,1
XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,"Chipotle is good because of the food as we all know... I would like to particularly review the service of this chipotle compared to others. When I use to come in here; the old manager was friendly; happy to admit mistakes; and would even reconcile things like having to wait because they hadn't cooked meat fast enough (he would give me a bag of chips or a soda cup; etc). When I went in last month around 4pm and it was slow; there were 3 people in line; I went up to the counter and started ordering my burrito; all of a sudden the lady slaps a big scoop of sour cream on my burrito without me asking for it. Now I am lactose intolerance and know people make mistakes so I simply said \hey sorry I didn't ask for that and am allergic.\"" I proceeded to get a response from whom I later found out was the manager saying \""well what do you want me to do remake the whole thing?\"" I proceeded with I hate to do that to you but I didn't ask for it and can't eat it with the sour cream. This was responded to a grunt as the woman threw the burrito in the trashcan and gave me an attitude to make me feel guilty as she remade my burrito. I have never been so turned off by customer service like that and to later find out she is the manager there is absolutely appalling. In addition I have several friends that have mentioned poor experiences with this staff.   I HAVEN'T RETURNED SINCE! Although I still go to chipotle as I think it is a great company and wonderful food; I will never be returning to that location and highly recommend against supporting customer service like that...""",0

Now I am lactose intolerance and know people make mistakes so I simply said \hey sorry I didn't ask for that and am allergic.\"" I proceeded to get a response from whom I later found out was the manager saying \""well what do you want me to do remake the whole thing?\"" I proceeded with I hate to do that to you but I didn't ask for it and can't eat it with the sour cream. This was responded to a grunt as the woman threw the burrito in the trashcan and gave me an attitude to make me feel guilty as she remade my burrito. I have never been so turned off by customer service like that and to later find out she is the manager there is absolutely appalling. In addition I have several friends that have mentioned poor experiences with this staff.   I HAVEN'T RETURNED SINCE! Although I still go to chipotle as I think it is a great company and wonderful food; I will never be returning to that location and highly recommend against supporting customer service like that...""",0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,I miss Dan. I didn't go all that often; but when I did Dan always knew my order. It's nice feeling like a regular; he made me feel at home.  That being said; the fish tacos are still the best and I will continue to go.,0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,"Let me start by saying I really miss Dan! The food is pretty much the same. I had the fish taco's and they were not as good as before. The tortilla was a lttle firmer; the fish was a bit smaller; the Chipotle mayo not as flavorful; neither were the salsa's for that matter.   The service was slower and not as friendly. The cashier asked me \if that was it\"" after each item also she is difficult to understand. Not as big of a fan as I once was.""",0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,This is the real deal.  Best tacos I have had in a very long time.  Real ly nice service too. It's nice to order and get friendly responsed. They have diet coke cans,1

C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,Wow... Honestly this is the best taco place I've tried here in AZ. I had ordered two of every taco and they were all delicious! It was also my first time trying Cabeza taco... And it's definitely one of my new favorite! The al pastor was sweet and had like a honey glazed on it which I liked a lot!  I would recommend and definitely come back!,0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,It's good to have this restaurant back. The menu is pretty much the same as before. The tacos are still inexpensive and very good; and the fried onions and jalapeno served on the side are a really nice touch; and they have the best horchata I've had in Phoenix. The counter area may seem cluttered with cases of soda; but the rest of the restaurant is orderly and the service is fast.,0

C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,Street tacos!!! My favorite thing of all time and they are amazing here!!! The corn quesadilla is unique and delicious. The fish tacos; pastor tacos and asada tacos were nothing short of amazing. Also; it's cheap; $2.25 for fish and $1.50 for asada and pastor. The service was very friendly. This place will be in my taco shop repertoire for sure .,1
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,The taco gods heard my cries; what luck would I have to stumble upon John's review? I hopped in my car and head right over...same place different folks; they're a bit confused and it took some repeating to get my order placed but once placed everything was as I remember it 2 months ago when Dan was the front man....wherever you are I hope all is well and you will be missed.  I ordered my usual for my son & self; asada taco; tostadas; and fish tacos....got home and they screwed up my tostadas - no meat; bean only..which I will call them about - one second thought maybe I won't there's no number listed.  Other than this mishap its back to business as usual over there,0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,Dan or no Dan this place is still amazing!! I actually found the service to be on point! They are actually giving more lemons with your meal than before (there's no one controlling the amount of lemons they give out anymore). Food is still awesome! Now they have churros. I actually wish they were open now because I'm jonesing for some lengua tacos uhmmm... Anyways make sure you check this place out!,0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,You can always trust those hole-in-the-wall places to put out amazing tasting food.  I've been wary of trying Mexican food here because I came from an area where Mexican food and the like pretty much dominated next to Asian. Plus my two experiences trying Mexican food here were lackluster.  Got a recommendation to try Atoyac for their tacos and yes; yes; yes this is what I'm talking about! I got the chorizo; asada and pastor tacos with horchata of course.  The horchata has pecans added to it (if you'd like) and is so good! Not too powdery; refreshing; not overwhelmingly sweet or cinnamon doused.   The tacos come with grilled onions and jalapeños and two salsas. The asada and chorizo were my favorite. I'm used to tasting the subtle sweetness from pineapple that  gets infused into the al pastor when roasted; but didn't get that here. Yummy salsa verde too; helps cut through the richness of the meats.  Giving the shop only four stars because I ordered 5 tacos and got only 4 in my take-out box albiet charged for the missing one. Also after getting my tacos; I realized I never got my Horchata once I got in the car- but the woman helping me told me it was a mistake and got me my drink. The order and service was quick.  Solid tacos here; can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu!,1

C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,"Jenny and I hit up RAEO because we recently moved to the area so we just MUST try the local food joints. I typically prefer to cheat east; not west; of our place but when you're talking about good mexican food in a little hole in the wall next to a tobacco shop in a we buy gold shopping center; you're going to have to give up on location (doubt they are planning to expand into Kierland or anything). I do wish they were open later but; as I pointed out about the location; I can't fault them for their hours.  Anyways; the food is good and the service is legit. We haven't decided yet if it will be our new \bring out of town visitors here for the good mexican food that is near our place\"" mostly because of the ambience. It's great for me; fine for Jenny when she's really in the mood for good mexican; but you know how visitors get. Maybe we'll take our most casual friends -- definitely not a place to meet the parents for the first time.   Recommend the hot dogs and you can't go wrong with any of the tacos. Fish tacos here are better than most places but their carne asada is great for those of you who like to play it safe with a classic order.""",1

C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,Blink and you'll miss this spot; tucked next to a gas station just before the northeast corner of 19th Avenue and Glendale; which has become our go-to for good tacos in the Valley.  The exterior might look a bit intimidating; and the interior doesn't leave much to be said for atmosphere; but all you need are their extremely well-priced tacos to feel like this place could be your second home.  Carne asada is some of the best in the valley; fish tacos are phenomenal; and pastor and lengua were not disappointing.  The tortillas are the perfect weight and texture with just enough corn flavor.  We also tried the molote; a masa fritter with potato and chorizo; which was a crispy nugget of Mexican comfort food reminiscent of mashed potatoes if mashed potatoes got a stylish makeover that involved spice; black beans; and queso fresco wrapped in fried; corn-y goodness.  Service might be lacking; but for less than $15 to feed a hungry couple; you really can't complain.,0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,Terrible name; great tacos.... You would never stop here if it weren't for the great reviews.  It went through some new ownership but the food is the same which is GREAT!  I have to order 4 tacos pastor each time because they are pretty much like crack cocaine for me.  I have tried a few other items here and although they are good I always go back to the pastor tacos.  This is a tiny place next door to the 7-11 and you will probably drive by this place because it is so small and there is not much parking so be careful when you go here.  Do yourself a favor and stop here for some tacos; they are small but are phenominal!,0
C9JmR3jZfGnW6xbPMCT3aQ,Jeff and I were excited to give this place a try after hearing it had re-opened. We loved their beef tacos and menudo prior to the temporry closing. We had just finished hiking at Piestwea and were both very hungry. Jeff and I both loved the lengua tacos. They were juicy and with plenty of meat. The cabeza tacos had good flavor but were a little dry and bit too greasy. I didn't like the pastor tacos and neither did Jeff. They were unusually sweet for my liking and I didn't care for the texture of the meat. Finally; I ordered a large menudo and loved everything about this delicious red stew; except for the fact that it was a bit too greasy this time. I've had plenty of menudo and I know there are ways to take some of the fat out so it's not so heavy. The tortillas served on the side were very good. The service was good and speedy but they weren't busy either. We def don't think it's as good as before; but; considering how hard it is to find good authentic Mexican food in Az; I give the new Atoyac a slightly above average rating.,1

2voFtcyopB3jJHepouMWDQ,"In-N-Out. IN through my mouth and OUT through \making toilet\"" as Borat Sagdiyev would say. It's the 2nd best In-N-Out I've ever been to; second to the one in Atascadero; CA off of Route 101. Ordering off the secret menu is key and I had the 3x3 done Animal Style with fries and a strawberry shake. Nice job guys - the patties; meat and toppings were perfectly placed; the cheese was perfectly melted and oozing and it was put together perfectly. The wax paper allowed for the burger to maintain its integrity and because of this; you are a solid 4.5 Yelps although Yelp will not allow me to do this. You get 5 Yelps for being the 2nd best rounded up.  THIS has been a review by Gaurav""",0
2voFtcyopB3jJHepouMWDQ,I saw a huge drive-thru line and was scared that the line inside would be also long. Fortunately; it wasn't. Food and service were perfect as always.,1
2voFtcyopB3jJHepouMWDQ,"IN-N-OUT IN MAH BELLY!  So freaking good it's almost criminal. Small menu here but what they do they do most excellently.  As we had a long ride up to Sedona today and needed to get some gas in the tank I noticed the sign on the highway for this In-N-Out location and made a bee-line for it after hitting the gas station. Did not want to get all bloated and sleepy by ordering off the \secret menu\"" so I went with the basic crave satisfying meal of a double double; fries; and a Neopolitan shake.  Good beejeezus this burger is like an orgasm in your mouth! Two beef patties of juicy goodness; fresh lettuce and tomato; crisp onion slices; and a soft buttery bun. Oh my! Decent enough fries and a thick delicious shake to wash it all down. Just ridiculously tasty!   This location itself is super clean with a cool retro look to it like back in the 1950's. A bunch of tables outside on a front patio that we ate on with the perfect weather out today. It just doesn't get any better then this!  That little devil on my shoulder kept taunting me to eat another burger; but I had to resist. Sedona was calling and it was a long ride. After this I already needed a nap!""",0

2voFtcyopB3jJHepouMWDQ,It was late; we had already been on the road nearly 4 hours coming back from the Grand Canyon; we were in need of a burger and fries.  As two chicks from the Northeast; we knew we had to get THE burger and fries.  Mcdonald's would just not do.  We decided to Yelp In N Out; and there it was; half a mile off the exit.  This location is laid out like any other In N Out location.  The basic menu was a glimmer of hope after a long and exhausting day.  The girl working the register was very nice and it turned out to be her first day.  I ordered a cheeseburger with animal-style fries; while my friend went with a double-double and regular fries.  The orders were a bit slow coming out but this is a place that makes everything fresh and I seemed to have forgotten that.  The food was good; as always.  It's hard to screw up the food here.  The service was friendly and the staff was singing along to songs playing on the radio (it was a quiet night; I can't fault them for that).  This definitely hit the spot.,1

2voFtcyopB3jJHepouMWDQ,Located on HWY17 on exit 223.  You'll pass this spot if you are heading to Sedona.    If you are out of town and visiting; make sure you stop for one of their DoubleDouble burgers. We stopped here and hit their drive thru for a quick meal before getting to the airport.  Service is fast enough and the burgers are good. I would ask them to put less cheese on the burger the next time.  The taste is easy to describe; a beefy beef burger; with crispy greens; onions and a soft butter bun. Its the anti-McD burger.  You can actually taste all the individual ingredients; from beef to tomatos to the buttery bun.  Everything is made fresh; and their fries are hand cut and fresh fried.. not the frozen McD stuff..,1
2voFtcyopB3jJHepouMWDQ,"When you're looking for a place to eat with not much time but you're not willing to sacrifice taste just for a \quickie meal\""; In-N-Out is a great place to go!    Although many places claim they have \""The Best Burgers\"" in town; the brutal reality is most places don't!! The coolest thing about In-N-Out; they don't talk the talk but they do walk the walk by delivering good eats consistently whether your in LA or Phoenix.    Their menu is smaller than most places and some peeps think they are limited to what they can order; but that just means they have not really experienced the true uniqueness of In-N-Out like a lot of us have ordering from their \""secret menu\""!!   My son usually gets a 1X1 with catchup; fries and a Neapolitan Shake ~ strawberry; vanilla and chocolate blended together.  My bride usually orders a protein style 1X1 burger with catchup & mustard and grilled onions with a diet.  For me; it's a 2x2 or 3x2 animal style with extra toast and well done fries!  DELISH!! The person with me today had a 5X5 aka; the \""take a nap afterwards\"" burger with hot melty cheesy well done fries and black and white shake!  It looks AWESOME!  They have never got my order wrong despite me ordering something cooked a different way with each visit.  They have that cute red and white decor/packaging and include an inscription like \""John 3:16\"" and \""Proverbs 3:5\""; which is awesome!  So the next time you're ready for fast food; don't make the mistake and go to just any burger place; go to In-N-Out! Order something from their \""secret menu\"" but don't tell anyone...""",0
2voFtcyopB3jJHepouMWDQ,This location never fails on the customer service.  They are nice...  And...

-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,Firehouse Serves up good subs and salads.   First; I have to say the service at Firehouse Subs is great!  The staff welcomes you when you walk through the door.  On my first visit to Firehouse Subs (some time ago).  Upon arriving we were met by an employee handing out menus.  My co-worker and I were asked if it  was our first visit to Firehouse Subs and we said yes. The emoloyee went over the menu and recommended we try the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  The sub was delicious.  After leaving we couldn't stop talking about how good the sub was. In fact we went right back to firehouse subs a few days later.   So if your hungry for a good sub at a great price; head over to firehouse.,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,I have no had Firehouse three times in three weeks.  I can easily say that this is my new favorite place to get a sub.  Gone are the days of cold subs and bring in the hot subs. The best one I've had (so far) is the cheddar and brisket sub.  Mouth watering and though it's 8:30AM; I could eat one right now.    The service is great and they are always there to answer any question you have.  Can't wait for the next trip!,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"have had a hard time deciding between 3-4. had the large smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket. It was about $8. had good flavor and a nice sauce to it. They have over 50 different hot sauces to pick from and have labeled them with useful \heat index\"" and I tried one which was great. I got my food to go; but I would go back just to write down the name of the sauce. I would again place the order to go; because this place is that its about as easy on the eyes as a spinning bulls eye. Get ready to be slapped in the face with their slogan \""Founded by Fireman\"" before you step through the door. My initial impression is that the place relies so heavily on America's love for Firemen (i.g.; a slogan with no relation to food) that it completely distracts from the food. I love Fireman; but there is no subtle or clever references to the theme. Instead it's a garish commercial display that robs the restaurant of any authenticity.   That being said; the food was still good. I would go back; but i'm not itching for it. Seems pretty on par with Jimmy Johns.""",0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,I tried this place for the first time tonight.  Ordered online; which was simple and had multiple options to customize the sandwich.  The service was less than stellar.

I had to ask for a cup and if I could pick out my chips.  The sub was pretty good; Italian sub; flavorful and tasty.  Despite the service I will visit again.,0

I counted ten of them in this location and only about 8 customers.when we were there i read and took a menu with me because they have lots of great sandwiches I would like to try on return visits and yes I will return. Firehouse subs is in my books ; the best subs.,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"I'd never heard of this place until I stumbled upon it today. The \established by firefighters\"" sign tug at my heartstrings; so I had to stop in. It's a few days post the 10th Anniversary of 9/11; after all.   Everyone who walks through the door is greated by every available employee shouting \""Welcome to Firehouse!\"" And they did a fair job of making it look a bit like a firehouse. There was some (artificial) exposed red brick; a large rescue scene mural; numerous firefighter photos; jackets and pants; etc. It's a brightly decorated in red; white and black and even has dalmation-motif tabletops. (There's also a lone TV for those who care; but the volume was down to nothing.) Outdoor seating with umbrellas and misters is available if you're up for watching Indian School traffic drive by.   The cashier was quick to educate me they toast only the buns. The meats and cheeses are steamed to 140 degrees to retain the flavor; and I'd have to agree that it did. I had the Italian (Genoa; pepperoni; salami; provolone and Italian dressing. It's served \""fully involved\"" meaning with lettuce and tomato. It was good with the dressing a bit on the sweet side. There are numerous hot and cold subs from which to choose; as well salads; cookies and brownies. Of course the menu wouldn't be complete without their \""Firehouse Chili\"". Be sure to check out their abundant supply of hot sauces; if you can take the heat!   The place was clean and the staff friendly. While I understand they've been open just four days; the service was a little slow. There was just one customer ahead of me; yet I still had to wait several minutes. I hope once they work some minor kinks out that the speed of service increases and it'll be a nice place to grab a bite.""",0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,For a chain style Sub place its quite good.  food seems fresh has good flavors and service is very friendly and prompt.  Seems to be a lot of competition in the sub sandwich business but they hold there own quite well with other chains.,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,As good as it gets! AMAZING service. You've earned these five stars.,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"So I was looking for a SUB on a Saturday for lunch; and I remember seeing Firehouse Subs because it was by the Sprouts grocery store that I go to.   I went to the website; and I decided to order online. I am glad I did because for some reason the Subs take  about 12-15 min to make. I understand they steam the meat; but still.  I thought that the online ordering process was a pretty cool feature. It had a lot of options to customize my sandwich. It definitely got me ready to have a SUB feast at Firehouse.  After checking out and spending almost $13 for a Large  (Steamer) SUB; and a sandwich plus a cookie. I was finally ready to pick up my order.  I decided to dine in to get the full experience. My order was ready when I got there; I got my soda; and used the Soda fountain to customize my soda which was cool.   The SUB was mediocre at best. Imagine a sub like Quiznos or Subway; but they \steam the meat.\""  That does not necessarily make it better though. They steam the meat so much that the meat was actually soggy; and the bread was meh. The cookie was a basic cookie; nothing special. The best part of the meal was actually the soda.  I would not recommend this place unless you want to pay high prices for a typical non gourmet franchise SUB.  The place looks and feels like Quiznos on roids; and with 5 people behind the counter it shouldn't take this long to make a SUB on average. I think that if you compare this to other sub franchises that it has an edge with all the cool hot sauces to choose from; and the Soda fountain that is not like anything else I have seen in a store like this; but the prices; wait times;  and mediocre SUBS hold this place back.""",0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,I would say that Firehouse Subs is not bad... And perhaps my experience wasn't the greatest as I took my sub to go.  This was my first time going. I had a free coupon and it's right next to my office; so decided to give them a try.   The employees were all pretty nice and greeted me/helped me. I saw one helping another girl to her car with a big bag of food. If it weren't for their great customer service I think I'd have rated them lower than 3 stars.  Their sub was soggy at best. Of course; I did take my order to go but since I work within 5 mins of there; it only took me upmost of 10 mins until I had the sub open. They stressed when I was there how their subs don't get soggy - but this was probably one of the soggiest subs I've ever eaten. You can ask for your sub cold; but they will automatically heat it for you if you don't tell them.  Overall; I don't think I will proactively go back. If someone else in my office goes; I may order something as it wasn't bad... but I didn't *love* it.,1

-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"Having served in the fire service for 15+ years this brand brings back memories.  It's always neat to see the pictures that each location as they are almost from the area local to the location.  The food has also always been good  My problem with this location was the fact that the staff seem very OK. with the customer with the young bird on their finger.  They had no problem that it was at the cash register as well as at the drink station.  I have no idea what type of bird it was; as it was chirping and still very young.  Therefore it was not a \service animal\"".  That and the fact that the State of AZ just passed legislation to mirror the ADA that BIRDS are NOT recognized service animals and therefore NOT PERMITTED in public venues.  The owners of the bird seemed to enjoy the fact they were getting away with having their bird in a restaurant.  Myself; I guess I signed up for their newsletter to soon.  What will be interesting is; even though Yelp discourages the solicitation of reviews; and Firehouse Subs asks for them; I wonder if they'll reply to this review?""",0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,I've been waiting to update my review of this location as to the owner sending me message about my experiance.  Sadly I was forced to repeat myself as to the day; date and time of my experiance.  As all the information was available already; I do not feel that it was necessary to ask for it again.  It was also stated that the owner and fanchisee was not present as they.  So I replied with a lenghty responce as to what had happend and provided details that I was unaware of at the time of my review.  You see the counter was to my back.  I did look over my shoulder and saw the bird; so I know it was there; I also heard it.  What I didn't know until I spoke to my wife was that the bird was sat on the counter at the cash register................................ Can you belive that; a live animal on a food service counter; NO WAY; but yep it happened.    Anyway; I sent a reply to clear up my review had caused and included my phone number with a request that I be called.  Nothing; nada; zilch; nyet...........  Guess making contact with the customer to ensure that there will never be a repeat of this type of incident is out of the question; guess corporate H.Q. needs to be notified.  Wanna quess where my next e-mail will go?,0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"A friend cut our lunch plans as soon as he saw Firehouse on the side of the road.  He said \You gotta try this place.\""  I went in and had him order for me and it was true.  The pulled pork sandwich was amazing!  Simple; but great!  So if you don't like sub sandwiches and think Firehouse is just another Subway or a Quiznos.......it isn't.  Firehouse is much better!  I have only gotten the pulled pork sandwich; but that is all I want.  Firehouse; also has those 30 different hot sauces; which I love to use to spice things up.""",0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,Not bad; probably worth a good 3.5 stars. The food is decent but the awesome soda machine; hot sauce bar; cleanliness; and friendly staff bump it up to a possible four for me. I assume they steam their meats; which turned out to be okay on the Steamer and the Italian; but on a cold turkey sub it turns the meat into this canned cat food like consistency. To me; it looked nasty but both my kids seemed to scarf it down without complaint. The steaming of the meat itself tends to make the bread soggier by the minute; so I recommend that you eat fast. I like the concept and the restaurant is nice - but I recommend working on the employee to employee communication just a tad more. I ordered a sandwich with just turkey and lettuce for my kid and ended up with mayo and tomatoes on it as well. The guy ahead of me said no mayo and ended up with mayo on his sub too. WTF.,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,I simply don't understand some of these reviews below. People are knocking the place because they steam their meat instead roasting/braising it? C'mon. So you can't handle something different or what?  So for this review; I'm comparing it to Subway and Quiznos.  First off; Subway and Quiznos build the sub right there in front of you. At Firehouse; this is not so much the case - you order at the register and then the workers prepare it. For this reason; your sub will take slightly longer to make than either of those places and this is mainly because of how they cook the meat.  Now to the complainers saying that the meat is soggy or whatever; I've never had this experience. And; besides that; not all subs are cooked the same at Firehouse. Maybe before discarding the place; try more of the menu? That is just me though! I've tried many of the subs - Firehouse Meatball; New York Steamer; Italian; Club on a Sub; and the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket. My favorites; in order; are Italian; Steamer; and Beef & Cheddar. On a slightly odd note; the Italian makes *great* leftovers if you can't finish it.  Nobody really seems to have mentioned this... but the soda machine is freaking awesome. I don't know how many flavors it has; but it is pretty much the craziest thing you will ever see. It has a touch screen where you scroll through and select your flavor. And when I say select your flavor I mean if you want a Lemonade.... do you want it to be lemonade; raspberry lemonade; lime lemonade; or strawberry lemonade. It is nearly the same for every beverage selection you make.  I definitely prefer Firehouse over Subway or Quiznos. Sure; they may be a little more pricey; but I still like it. I will have to check out Jimmy John's; which everyone seems to rave about to see what all the fuss is about and round out my review for all 4 places.,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"The laundromat is next door to Firehouse Subs. It was around 109 degrees today. So we put our clothes into the washers and go outside to have a smoke. There are maybe ten empty tables out front of the sub place; we sit at the end table.  As we sit we talk about if we want to go in and grab something to eat now or wait until after the clothes are done. When a worker comes up and asks if we've been helped yet. My sister says \No\"" then the worker says \""Really??? So what you're just going to sit there and not order anything!?\"" then mutters \""F***ing A**HOLES\"" Great customer service. Now we *are* never going order anything. All it would have took was a \""can I get you a menu\"" or \""can I help\"" or \""just go in when you're ready\"" but no your worker was a total jerk. I mean I get it; there are almost always homeless people around there or at the least sort of shady looking people hanging around; you don't want loiterers hanging around making a mess and taking up customer seats. But it was 109; no one is waiting to eat outside... in fact there were only two people inside; hardly a rush. You would have had four more customers today if you had any sense of customer service. Now you've lost four; and our friends and family; and got this review. I can't say what the food was like since I never made it inside and have zero plans to ever go back.  EDIT- I am willing to upgrade my rating to 3 stars from the 1 star I initially gave it. The owner replied to my rating which goes a long way toward mending my opinions of the staff. Maybe one day I will get to try the food and edit my ratings further.""",0

-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,I want to like this place; I really do; but today's New York Steamer was probably a Top 10 disappointing sandwich of my life. Soggy; lifeless; unimaginative; and overpriced.   I'd been to Firehouse one previous time; and the meatball was better. Far from spectacular; but much more satisfying than the corned beef/pastrami number I ordered during Visit #2. It was steamed meat; cheese and mayo on an old-tasting white hoagie. No veggies; no color; no texture; no good.  The Firehouse concept and story are cool. The employees are nice. The fountain drink vending machine is second to none. And I enjoy being able to watch college hoops while my sandwich gets steamed to death. But these pros cannot save an underwhelming experience that cost me $9. Subway's $5 Cold Cut Combo would have been a better investment.,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"Firehouse Subs is a relatively new place here in the Valley and they offer up a tasty; toasted version of a tired old lunch staple.    I was driving aimlessly south into Phoenix with a vague recollection that there was a Firehouse Subs nearby. I almost gave up when I saw the Chicago Hamburger sign; but it was only a little further along Indian School. I actually nearly drove past it; before turning into the strip mall at the last second.  I found a parking space in front; and the place wasn't too crowded for one o'clock.   As I said in my Tip; these folks are over the top friendly; but in good way. They greeted me warmly as I came in; asked if I had ever been here before and offered up that their #1; #4 and #5 Subs were their most popular sandwiches.  Nice!  I took a few moments to study the board before ordering the New York Steamer. It's a nice combination of Corned Beef; Pastrami and melted Provolone. They then asked if I wanted the usual of mustard; mayo and Italian Dressing on it? Say what?   Mayo I thought?  I haven't heard of mayo on a pastrami & corned beef sandwich since Woody Allen accused Diane Keaton of doing that in \Annie Hall\"" LOL  You should know; that almost all of Firehouse's medium subs are $5.89. They advertise that for $2.00 more; you can get the large. So; a large it was and I asked them to hold the mayo & dressing.   I've taken a few pictures of the inside of the restaurant and of my sandwich. It was very large; probably a foot or so long. It was also very good; but too much to finish. I wrapped the other half for home and was told later by one of my homebodies; that it was really very good. LOL. Clearly; I'll need to start marking my food in the frig.   Besides what I ordered; Firehouse also has something called the \""Hook & Ladder\"" it's a sub of Smoked Turkey & Virginia Ham with Provolone; a Firehouse Meatball; an Italian with salami; pepperoni; ham with melted provolone; a Club; a Turkey Bacon Ranch; and a Firehouse Steak & Cheese. They also have two Premium Subs on the menu: the Firehouse \""Hero\""; with roast beef; smoked turkey breast Virginia ham and provolone; or; the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket for $6.19 each.   My large #3 NY Steamer; with mustard only; came to $7.89; plus $0.66 in taxes for Gov Brewer. BTW; I cannot wait for the State to rollback those temporary sales tax increases can you?  LOL  Enjoy!""",1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"I really really wanted to give this place a higher star due to the \established by firefighters\"" idea; but I think after it has been opened for a few weeks; the kinks that the other reviewers have mentioned should have thus been addressed and ironed out by now.

Well; despite my on-line order and the payment made online via credit card (there was no option to pay at pick up if you order online); when I arrived punctually at the designated time for pick up; the workers looked confused at the confirmation number I handed to them for pick up.

The only thing I liked about my  Cold-Cut-Supposedly-Hot-Italian Sub was the french bread---The ones at Subway have a weird aftertaste.

-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,First time I went in for a to go order; they gave me the wrong sandwich. I called to let the manager know and he offered me a free sandwich. Went back the other day and got the Brisket and cheddar with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce (my personal choice at home) OMG it was amazing. The meat was so flavorful and tender; the sauce didn't cover it up at all. Beautiful foodie experience,1
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,"First time I've been to this location; second time trying Firehouse Subs. The sandwiches are awesomely amazingly deliciously tasty. Then why the 2 stars; you ask? Service. I'm not an impatient person; or one to complain about service; but my experience today just struck a nerve. I know this place hasn't been open long; and they still have kinks to work out; so I will; of course; update this review as seems fit with my next visit.  I placed my order online and it gave me a pickup time of 20 minutes later (1:03pm). I showed up at 1:05pm and was welcomed by all 10+ employees shouting \welcome to Firehouse!\"" I approached the cashier and was told (by I *think* a manager) it would be another 4-5 minutes. Okay; that's fine. I check out the cool Coke machine and then take a seat right in front of the counter to wait. And wait. And wait. A few other people come in; order their food; receive their food; and leave. I'm still waiting. It's 10 minutes later (1:15pm by then) and I tell the manager (or whatever he was - he seemed to be directing others what to do) that I'm still waiting for my order. He looks over to the 6+ people in the prep area and asks \""how is that fax order doing?\"" One employee says \""oh; it's here\"" and pulls it off the back counter and hands it to him. He gives me the bag and says \""here you go.\"" No apology; no thank you; no have-a-good-day; nothing. So in essence; it took 40 minutes from the time I placed my order until I received it. The purpose of ordering online was so that I DIDN'T have to wait.  The problem; I think; is that there are way too many employees standing around all at once. I'm sure they have their reasons; but it just doesn't seem that communication between the 10+ of them is smooth. I sure hope future visits make up for this one.""",0

Okay; that's fine. I check out the cool Coke machine and then take a seat right in front of the counter to wait. And wait. And wait. A few other people come in; order their food; receive their food; and leave. I'm still waiting. It's 10 minutes later (1:15pm by then) and I tell the manager (or whatever he was - he seemed to be directing others what to do) that I'm still waiting for my order. He looks over to the 6+ people in the prep area and asks \""how is that fax order doing?\"" One employee says \""oh; it's here\"" and pulls it off the back counter and hands it to him. He gives me the bag and says \""here you go.\"" No apology; no thank you; no have-a-good-day; nothing. So in essence; it took 40 minutes from the time I placed my order until I received it. The purpose of ordering online was so that I DIDN'T have to wait.  The problem; I think; is that there are way too many employees standing around all at once. I'm sure they have their reasons; but it just doesn't seem that communication between the 10+ of them is smooth. I sure hope future visits make up for this one.""",0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,Tried the online ordering again and this time it was perfect. When I arrived to pick up my tasty goodness; there was a City of Phoenix Ford Eco van loading up with people; so I was skeptical that my order would be ready; them having just made a bunch of meals for these people. Plus the tables inside were quite full. But to my pleasant surprise; my sammiches were ready! Hooray! I paid online; and forgot about my punch card; and they didn't mention it; so I was a little sad. But that was my fault I guess.  I don't think I mentioned it in my other review; but their-brand hot sauce is amazing on any sub I've tried. I'm also determined to try as many flavors as I can from the cool Coke machine. So far Cherry Coke Zero and Fanta Zero Orange have my approval. :),0
-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q,Came in after a long day with a long night ahead of me. They were closing in 15 minutes; so half-expected some glares and huffs & puffs from young staff. However; this was certainly NOT my experience. I was greeted warmly and service was quick. The same was for the guy who came in 5 minutes before they closed. Will definitely stop by again.  Also; really dig the variety of hot sauces. Love me some peri-peri!,1
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Reasonably Priced Food and Generous Portions.  Señor Taco is a favorite of a friend of mine who has two children ages 9 and 12.  Señor Taco might not be one of my favorite eating establishments but the food at Señor Taco is reasonably priced and the serving sizes are very generous.   Señor Taco has a  small condiment bar. I really enjoy the salsa bar with all the different types of salsa's and hot carrots.  The  burrito  I ordered was good and as I mentioned; a very generous  serving size; large enough to take some home.   Señor Taco offers a variety of entrées to order from and the customer service is second to none.  No pretense just come in; order; sit down and enjoy.,1

6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I'm working out at Litchfield Park this month so I finally had a chance to try Senior Taco--a place that always seems packed at their Fountain Hills location the times I am up there.   This is sort of a Filiberto's-style place. It is fast food; it has a similar menu. The prices are similar. However; the food was quite different.   I tried three things; trying some of each and bringing some back to the office with me. First; the carne asada torta. I would say this is the most similar in flavor to Filibertos. Not bad; but not super great. It would have benefited from more meat and less guacamole. I also had a shredded beef; hard-shell taco. This was quite a bit different than Filiberto's and; in my opinion; better. They did not fry it as much; and it had a lot more cheese than I usually get at Filibertos. I also had the carne asada soft taco. The size was large and it was very good. Nothing here is super great; but the tacos were especially yummy.   Service; cleanliness and all of the rest were average or above for a fast food restaurant.   I give it 3.5 stars--leaning toward four due to the size of the dishes for the price.,0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Awesome food; affordable; and great service all in the same place. Wow you got to try this place..,1
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,"3.5 stars.... maybe 4  Forget about any of the other fast food Mexican food joints.  The \Ricos\""; \""Bertos\""...  Taco Bell... etc.   This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food. The beans are great!  The rice isn't bad and the burritos are huge!    We've eaten there twice and the first time around everything was a hit. No issues with the food or the service.  The second time around... the food was still pretty good. The grilled chicken nachos were pretty greasy. the chicken... although flavorful was fatty and this set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Wasn't horrible.. just could have been better.    Do drop in and give this place a try. It isn't expensive... and you better bring an appetite....as mentioned... the portions are huge.   We will go back. Hatch""",0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Ordered take out from this place a few days ago. I had the beef enchilada; beef taco with rice and beans. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas with rice and beans. The beef enchilada meat was seasoned perfectly as were the refried beans. The beef taco meat however didnt seem to have any seasoning. The meat was good but just no flavor really. I would assume they would use the same seasoned shredded beef for the taco that they used on the enchilada but I guess not. Either way the food was very fresh and flavorful minus the beef in my taco. Prices were good for the amount of food you get. Service was a bit bla; but I was ordering take out anyways. Will definetly return to try out the rest of the menu.,0

6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,3.5 Stars  You will not find very authentic food here but close for a fast casual restaurant.  What Señor Taco does well is give you huge portions; a good bang for the buck.  The two items I really enjoy off their menu is the chilaquiles platter that is enough food for two and their carne asada fries which my daughter and I share and still leave food behind.  Since the girls who work the counter recognize us we are given great customer service but do notice this is not the case all the time and is a area to improve.  The kitchen isn't the fastest all the time but the flavor and portions are always the same.  If you're planning on arriving with a party of 5 or more seating is limited.  They mainly have booths and a few tables that seat 4 max.  You will not pay a lot of money here for your meal and should have a good selection of items to choose from to appease most folks.,1
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Great food.  The Hashbrown Breakfast burrito is the best!  The chips and salsa are the best in the area; we order them to go for parties.  If they served beer they'd have gotten the 5th star. (and I probably wouldn't eat any place else) :-),0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Senor Taco is a cozy little place; and very clean. The ambiance is nice; and the employees are friendly.  My friend and I arrived at just the right time; because minutes after our arrival there were like 3 or 4 families that walked through the door. (I noticed that none of them waiting long to receive their order.)  I ordered combo #14: Two chicken flautas. It came with rice and beans; but no drink. I thought it was very tasty; especially after dressing it with salsa from their salsa bar. I was also pleased to see carrots that have been soaked in jalapeno juice. Moreover; their flour tortillas didn't taste like crappy store-bought tortillas that are full of preservatives. Still; they didn't completely taste homemade.  If you're looking for fast food Mexican that isn't crappy like Taco Hell or Jack in the Crack; I recommend giving Senor Taco a try!,1
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE AT NIGHT!!! My wife and I came here because their sign outside said open till 10pm and we happened to be out for a late dinner; so we decided to stop here. We ordered our food at 9:15pm and got the food ten minutes later; and when we got it; it was packaged like a to-go order. I didn't make a big deal out of it so I took it to our table and started to open the styrofoam trays. When the cashier seen us about to eat; she says to us \You can't eat here; were about to close\"". So i informed her that their sign said closed at 10pm. She pretty much argued with me saying no; it says 9:30(even after I literally went outside and pointed to it) I have never been forced to leave a restaurant like that! Usually a restaurant will just lock the doors preventing further customers to come in. The employees were rude about it; and when my wife called the next day to talk to the owner; he showed no concern. Great way to lose business!! It pretty much ruined our dinner which was cold and soggy by the time we got home. Just beware...""",0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I have passed this little place by a million times on random trips to the grocery store. Today my husband and I finally popped in for a quick; cheap lunch. While we weren't expecting Frontera Grill; we were appalled with the MOLDY breading on the fish tacos. We brought it to the attention of the gal taking orders; and were offered a replacement (pass) but no refund. We won't be back.,0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I was not impressed with this place. I ordered a 2 taco combo one carne asada and one pollo asado. The taco shells were thick and hard. The meat was bland. I had to put lots of sauce on it to give it some spice. Also; I ordered tortilla chips and a drink. My total was $11.48. I could've gone to a nice sit down restaurant and received something that tasted much better for what I paid. Next time I will drive the extra 3 miles to go to chipotle when I'm craving tacos.,0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I love me some good Mexican food and I have to say Senior Taco is one of my favorites; but this location sucks! The food is way to greasy; the service is POOR and the atmosphere is not welcoming at all! If you want good Senior Taco food; service; and an inviting atmosphere head west to the location off Estrella south of the 10!!! Way better for sure!,0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,def one of the most authentic fast food places around. service is always a 10/10 and the food is at least a 9.5/10 every single time. i have never had a bad experience in any way shape or form. prices are pretty reasonable. a little more than the filiberto type places but the quality is way above and beyond!!! be wary of the one on estrella and the one on mcdowell though.,1
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Really great food for a great price! Everything I've ordered has been delicious  but I love their battered fish tacos. The seasoned rice is always light and fluffy; making a nice complement to the meal.  Everything is flavorful and the salsa bar has something for all tastes. It's such an affordable; fast; and convenient place. Crazy to get such quality food for the same price as a typical fast food meal. Only marking them one star off for the decor of the eating area; not bad but could be a little more inviting.,0
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Beans; carne asada; great service; & hot food...not to mention it's CHEAP! I don't care where you go...the carne asada is less fatty & the beans are the best!!!!! MMMMM MMMMM,1
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,My West Valley go to place for fast Mexican food. The winners here are the hashbrown burrito; carne asada fries; and cali chicken burrito.   Top choice:  California Chicken Burrito. There's something about the crunchy fries mixing with the savory chicken; cheese; sour cream; and love that oozes amazing!   Overall; the food quality is fresh; consistent; and delicious with a great value for the price you pay.   Exemplary customer service. The staff is always smiling; always joking; and always helpful.   Hungover? They serve SCRUMPTIOUS menudo on Saturday and Sunday morning. Better get there fast otherwise it will be gone by 10 AM.,1
6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Loved this place!  Passed by and decided to give it a try.  Staff was real nice and food was very good - all of us ordered something different and enjoyed it!,1
ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,"My trek to Whataburger was an artistic quest. I'd never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the \Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational\"" in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place; I had to come here.   It wasn't bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - \""are you sure you don't want a meal; honey?\"" Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which; admittedly; was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window; probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely; it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me.   The burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything you'll find at any other fast food joint and don't forget the wait; I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say; a Mickey D's or an In-n-Out (which; incidentally; Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger that's exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust you're inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger; plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal; fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda; and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine; when; in fact; by going to those other places; you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger; meal; soda; dessert assembly (and don't forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation); in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe); and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?""",0
ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,Whipped in here today for a first visit to this Whataburger & second visit to ANY Whataburger; ever.  (They're not in California; where I'm from.)

ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,24/7 hours = good  However; they rarely get my order right and by the time I get home I don't feel like driving back after a long day the office or school; even though it IS the closest location to my house. They always re-read my order to me to verify it's accuracy but then they put it on the burger anyways (Mustard when I ask for NO mustard; once they added random mayo to my burger; and once they left out my pickles) Now what's a burger with no pickles.  The shakes are always very runny compared to the location on 3rd Ave and Indian School. That location is the one I go to now because this location can never seem to get it right; even after a number of second; third and fourth chances.  I love me some Whataburger but will no longer be visiting THIS location.,0
ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,A friend and I stopped here today for lunch. I for some reason thought it was an odd choice; but he seems to go often and enjoys it. In fact the woman taking the order said to him; no drive through today? It would looks as though he is known in the whataburger world.   The people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected. I ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink. I opted for the Hi-C. I do not like sloppy food and this burger would not have been if the bun had held up. But as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place. The meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour. The onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy. I loved the Hi-C.   You know you just never know if you will like something until you try it. I tired it and that is enough. Nice friendly folks though. I do like friendly.,1
ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,Slllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.  Service is generally friendly; but is it worth the wasted gas idling in the drive thru and the potential that they will mess your order up 25 percent of the time?,1

ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,I love to eat here. Breakfast lunch dinner or late night. My favorite is the dbl Whataburger with cheese; grilled onions; the works with the Onion Rings and a root-beer.    I like the breakfast also and the chicken strips.  Fries are good here also.  Order is always right!  It cost a litle more to eat here but I think it is so worth it.  Generally spend $9 to $11 per adult.,1
ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,I love Whataburger. The burgers are far and away the best fast food burgers you can get. Don't even say that In-N-Out is better. I always get my burger the same way; #1 Whataburger with sliced jalapeno; grilled onions; bacon; and cheese... yes its indigestion central. The last 3 times I have been there I got home only to realize my burger was not how I ordered it. The first time; they gave me a whole grilled jalapeno. What the hell am I going to do with this other than get a firebomb in my stomach? and the onions weren't grilled. Who goes to Whataburger and orders a side of a giant jalapeno!?   Second visit; there were no jalapenos to speak of whatsoever; not even the giant grilled one. They got the onions; cheese; and bacon right though.  Third visit; I straight up got someone elses order. I got a friggin chicken sandwich. I'll make the trek to another store from now on. This one is just craptastic.,0
ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,Open 24/7; thank goodness!  When I start work before 6 am at the hospital next door; I stop by and grab a coffee.   Sometimes; for those extra long days; I get a warm biscuit with honey; just to give me an added little pep; lol.  Don't judge me ;)  I did try their Taquito with Sausage & Cheese. It was actually good. I asked for both the red and green salsa so I could taste test and see which I liked best. The red salsa won by a landslide.  The service at this location is always top notch. Friendly and professional.,1

v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,I have had Five Guys a few times now at various locations and I have only been moderately impressed. Stopped in here a couple of days ago and it was okay. If I had to choose between In N Out and Five Guys; it would be In N Out hands down. Service was good; cashier was polite and prompt. I ordered a cheeseburger with a little cajun fry. The cajun fry's are good and they do set Five Guys apart from other burger shops but I think if you are a burger shop; you must do both burgers and fry's equally as good.  My burger was okay. It was not bad by any means but it was not great. I ordered it with jalapenos and A1 which was different but a good flavor combo. Overall decent experience. I wouldn't count it out completely but I would't go out of my way to go back.,1

v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,My quick summary:  Great food & more than prepared to work with dietary restrictions.  I know a lot of people complain about the noise level; but I happen to like it.  It really kind of goes with the whole experience.  The staff was really knowledgeable.  They knew what gluten free meant; and even the cashier knew off the top of her head that they had dedicated fryers; so the fries are also gluten free.  Most places look at me like I have eye growing out of my forehead.  And they'll customize your burger any way you like it.  Did you know they'll grill the jalapenos if you ask them?  I did.  :)  The soda machines are; in one word; awesome!  It's a touch screen.  You pick your drink type & it allows you to add flavor shots.  May I recommend the light cherry lemonade?  Great way to start a meal.  The burgers were perfect.  I watched the guy behind the line tenderly wrap mine in lettuce; since I can't have a bun.  And he then re-wrapped it after making sure the proper condiments had been put on (the guy in charge of that apparently wasn't sure).  The burger was wrapped so well; it really resembled a bun & I could have picked it up & eaten it with my hands; no problem.  The fries were warm; delicious; and plentiful.  They were seasoned perfectly.  My fiance & I shared a small order with our burgers; and there were still some left over.  Should have taken them to work & tortured my coworkers with the smell...  Oh well; there will always be next time.,1
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,This review is a review of the corporate stores such as this one. I love their food but there is one thing that always makes me second guess going to Five Guys and I am sure you know what it is. The music. I am a very patient person but every time I walk into these places I want to walk right out. Don't go here if you are on a date or plan to visit with anybody. You will not be able to hear them without everyone else hearing the conversation. Thank god this one restaurant does have outdoor seating and there is no music. What you'll feel like when you go to these restaurants is that you're having five guys screaming at you the whole meal. Please turn the music down so people can enjoy each other's company and  also enjoy the food. Aside from the very loud music of this restaurant is the fact that when you order the most basic of the meals at this restaurant you will feel like someone picked hour pocket. Don't get me wrong the food is fresh tasting but I can feed a small family with what I have spent eating here and that's just a combo. Five guys you could be so much more!,0
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,This burger joint is overrated as a mother f*cker.  Burger: I ordered a bacon cheeseburger all the way. It was top 5 greasiest burgers I've ever eaten. I was worried for my heart after finishing. The flavor was average as was the quality of meat. Honestly; I wouldn't be able to tell between a burger patty from Burger King and Five Guys.  Fries: I ordered the Cajun Fries. Saltiest things I've ever eaten. I couldn't finish more than half of them and let the others go to waste.  I hear people comparing this place to In-N-Out in SoCal and I just can't see it. I'd rather eat at McDonalds than eat at Five Guys. At least at McDonalds; I don't have a bag and wrapper literally dripping with grease and oil.  In-N-Out c*ck slaps Five Guys.,0
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,Good burger. Got the basic cheeseburger; it had two patties not sure if that was an accident. Burger was yummy. I ordered via the website and picked up in 7 minutes. They wait to cook your fries when u get there. Fries were also yummy and fresh. Fries also were a good serving size. I was not able to eat all of my fries ...but I would bet two to three people can feast on. I was surprised by how expensive a burger and fries was but I was satisfied by meal. Five guys is good but only slightly better than In-out. I think that for the price; I would go to  In-bf out over five guys.,0
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,Food still yummy but wait on web order was ridiculous.  They totally forgot I was there. My burger was cold when I got home which is annoying bc I paid 7.00 for it. My fries were hot but with a soggy burger...not worth it.   May need to venture out to smash burger.,0
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,Love their burgers and fries. Their burgers are huge so we normally get little burgers and regular fries. One time we ordered large fries and it was basically the whole bag so we learned our lesson. This is our local go to burger place. I think it's even better than In N Out.,0
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,"It's mostly a burger joint; similar to Fatburger or Johnny Rockets.  Though they do offer a few other menu choices.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I had a burger (regular) and fries.  The regular burger was pretty good sized because they do TWO patties.  I like that.  Makes the price a little more palatable.  Burgers are fried on a griddle.  I really prefer my meats to be cooked over actual fire; but that's not an option here.  I went with it anyway.  It is cooked fresh when you order it; and you can get any combination of toppings you want (or none at all; if you prefer).  The burger was pretty good.  Not great; but pretty good.  The fries you can get one of two ways.  Either \plain\"" with just salt (like just about any other place would do) or with Cajun seasoning.  I opted for the latter; and they were really very tasty.  They post on a white board where their potatoes came from that day.  No way to verify if it's real or not; but it was an interesting thing for them to do.  They really do mound the fries up.  I ended up with more than I expected; which was a good thing!  While you wait they have a box of peanuts you can help yourself to.  I grabbed some.  They tasted old.  Not bad.  Just not really fresh.  I've been to other places that do this; and these definitely weren't as fresh as I would expect.  This wouldn't be my first choice for a burger; but they're pretty good.  I'd take Johnny Rockets over them because of their fabulous chocolate shake.  But if JR isn't nearby this place will do in a pinch.""",1
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,"I LOVE 5 guys burgers and fries!   Little (meaning 1 patty) bacon cheeseburger is the way to go! Their bacon is so crispy; just the way I like it! I get \everything\"" on it. This even includes grilled mushrooms and grilled onions. They carefully place each topping on and fold it in the foil with perfection.   The fries are good although not my favorite. I like that the post where their potatoes come from up on the white board each day. One regular size order feeds 3 people!!!   Peanuts to munch in while you wait. I love that.   They also have those awesome high-tech touch screen soda machines that are sweeping the nation!   Lacking that fifth star solely because of the price. For this family of 3; we spend no less than $25 in a single visit.""",0
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,"Okay; generally good food and pleasant service overall. Tonight it was not that.   No baskets for the peanuts in either of the boxes.  I asked if they had any and they eventually put some in one of the boxes. Order placed was slow in delivery.   Three orders came in after the order I placed; with minutes in between; and I watched them get called and leave the building well before my order was ready. My order:  one (1) small burger; plain; and one cheeseburger with catsup;  mushrooms; grilled onion; jalapenos and one medium french fry.  In case you hadn't heard before;  they are known for their large fry orders. I got home to a small fry and my receipt shows i did pay for the medium size which is supposed to be enough for 2 - 3 people.  I also asked for nutrition information at the same time I was placing my order and the person taking my order showed me a card with what comes ON the sandwiches but was unsuccessful finding one so she asked another guy (the manager?!) behind the counter.  While he's scavenging to find one she walks to the other register to help another customer.  Not once does he acknowledge me or say anything to me about never seeing them in the store but he is digging around at the front counter just like she had done. I ask if I can just pay for my order and that It'll be okay if they can put the brochure with my burgers to go.  He completes the payment transaction and then promptly disappears to the back room.   So now I've waited for my order I ask again about the nutrition information brochure because there's nothing there.  Guy (manager?!)  once again disappears to scavenge for one; without saying a thing like \ill be right back; i couldnt find one; maybe look online\""...;  -nothing.   A girl follows him into the back room after I ask IF they actually have them or am I standing just around waiting for the fries get cold.  She returns a few minutes later to tell me they don't have any. The other questions i asked of the two that were at the counter went in one ear and out the other.  They looked at me as if to acknowledge my question but turned and walked back to pull napkins.  I was surprised to the point of shaking my head and laughing at the situation. FWIW; I picked up son and hubbies food here and got myself a sandwich at Jimmy Johns.  Had much better service there too.  Oh yeah Five Guys; way to represent.""",0

v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,$14 for a burger; fries; and a coke and let me tell you it was worth it! I ordered the Bacon Jalapeño Cheeseburger and I've had it several times before at other locations but none like this! The burger was cooked to perfection; they didn't skimp on the fries; and oh did I say the burger was cooked perfectly? Glad I work nearby because I'll be stopping in a lot more often.,0
v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,I was introduced to five guys burgers during one of my many trips up to Chandler Blvd. The burgers come in two sizes; a double and a single. All of the toppings are free and the options are plentiful. The soda machines are the new touch screen type with lots of different flavors. The burgers are always juicy and delicious although I could stand for them to be a little bigger. The real reason why I will continue to return are the fries. OMG these are probably the best fries I've had since I had Thrasher's Fries on the boardwalk of Ocean City MD. If you put ketchup on these fries you are missing the point entirely. Vinegar is provided on the condiment table and takes the fries to the next level. As a word of advice; the small order of fries is more than enough for two people. Save your money and share a small order.   This brings me to the only real negative...the prices. I am aware that if you want a quality burger you will pay for it; but when my wife and I get a burger each; a small fry to share and two drinks and it comes to 20 dollars; something is wrong. I'm never full when I leave and it seems like I should be after spending 20 bucks for lunch.   Definitely worth checking out though if you're a burger/fries fan.,0
yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,Skimpy on the servings as well as the service. employee at register made a comment about employee being late because she was probably macking in her car.,0
yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,Really good fast food. They have great service. Willing to give you extras and make you feel like your not overpaying. But at a 1.50 surcharge for guacamole they aren't fooling anyone. I cant dock them for the freshness- meat is always top notch and unlike Taco Bell- doesn't give you explosive diarrhea.,1
yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,Chipotle is well known. People now a days love it. I like it also just not this location. I came in and they brought fresh rice so I was happy ordered my burrito to go and when I got home to eat it rice wasn't even cooked. It was hard and honestly ruined the whole burrito. I know places make mistakes but how many times a day do they make rice? A lot right? So they should know how to make it.,0
yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,"I noticed the quality; quantity; and service have gone down significantly since I started going here six months ago.  The last time I went; the burrito my boyfriend ordered was half the size it typically is. Mine fell apart while the girl was making it; but she kept going so when I opened the foil; all the ingredients fell out of the tortilla.The cashier was quick to take my money; but she ignored our burritos waiting to be bagged. Four burritos piled up; waiting to be bagged; while she stood there blankly staring into space.   No one says a simple \hi\"" anymore; just \""burrito or bowl?\"" and no \""have a nice day\"". It appears the workers don't care about their job.""",0

yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,Ok; I have read other posts that ran into the same issues that I did here. The food was average but it may have been better if I could have got what I wanted. It is not that they got my order wring; but they ran out of some of the things I wanted. I get that it was dinner time and people had been in there all day; but you have to know when you are running out of guacamole (which is $1.50 anyway); and find a way to get more. It wasn't just the guacamole that they were out of; they also somehow ran out of brown rice.  I ended up going with a cilantro lime rice; which was good; but again not what I wanted. Over all I feel like I got a bunch of beans; ok amount of chicken; no guacamole; and a secondary kind of rice.   I don't come here often and this is not the way to get me going back.,0
yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,This is your standard Chipotle with standard fare. The place has a decent sized dining area and a large patio. The patio is nice because for some reason they keep the place at sub zero temperatures inside. Ok so that's an exaggeration; but at the same time; as Arizona residents we are better acclimated to the heat and don't necessarily need it to be so darn cold inside.   Aside from that; the place kept pretty clean and the service is friendly and efficient.  On my last trip I ordered a chicken salad with guacamole. I'm not sure if it was a standard serving; but I got a monster dollop of guacamole. It was pretty darn good. The rest of the salad was ok. The chicken was over salted and there wasn't much lettuce; but with the salsa and black beans; all and all it was a fresh and satisfying meal that I would order again.  I usually get a side of chips; but lately I've noticed that they are way too salty. But still really good.  Enjoy!!,1

yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,I go here with a friend about once every couple of weeks. Thus far the food has been very delicious; though the staff is hit and miss. Sometimes they are helpful and attentive; other-times you might have to wait around for a few minutes before they get to your order.   Also; you must be specific with what you want on your food. For example: if you want extra beans; speak up!  The seating is a bit small; but that's because half of it is reserved for the patio area which is just lovely. Overall a decent place; I'd call it the Subway of Hispanic food.,0
yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,Finally put a restaurant that wont go out of business in this spot.  This location is smaller than the other places here but it still good size for this area.  I love this corner with all the upscale food and shopping.  Chipotle will do well here and as always the food is consistently good quality and fast service.  I always get a burrito or burrito bowl with chicken or steak but you cant go wrong with anything here.,0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Delicious burgers and fries. Great customer service and quick! Love In and Out Burger!,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,First time trying the restaurant. Went through the drive thru. Person taking order and collecting the money was very personable. Food was great for the price.   I even like how they ask if you want a placemat if you eat in the car.,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Went on Saturday around noon.  They were slammed (drive thru and inside)!  Well run establishment!  Approx. 15 workers in back doing an outstanding job getting orders taken and served.  Happy workers!    With the limited menu it was easy and so fast!  Good food.  Fresh.  Thin meat. Peppers were pleasant surprise.  Nice.  Fair price.,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,I think these burgers are overrated. By the time I got done ordering ( the # 1 and a extra cheeseburger) it was $  9.00,0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,"Finally made it around to this In-N-Out location for lunch today.  Of course the place was packed since I arrived at 12:20 but the ordering line moved along at good speed & friendly Anthony took my order.  After ordering; all the seating was taken at first; but soon a table came up a charged over to it; as did a couple visiting from Chicago.  We agreed to have lunch together & it was fun for all.     :-)  I got to share that an In-N-Out burger was the first thing I ever ate outside of my parents & relatives' houses.  It was Sept. 6; 1950; I was 3; & my dad had just surprised my Mom with a brand new Powder Blue '51 Chevy convertible for her Birthday; with the top down & a big red ribbon across the hood.  She dropped me into the passenger seat & off we whizzed down Baldwin Avenue & east on Highway 66 a bit to to In-N-Out in Baldwin Park; California.  (See photo.)  Amazingly; Highway 66 has fizzled down to being the service road for the 10 Freeway; but In-N-Out is still there; howbeit remodeled a bit (to speak in 1950 English).     :-))  I loved my first Cheeseburger (except for the onions...  Mom took them off.)  Also; amazingly; the food is still exactly the same as it was then; except that they have expanded the menu some to include the Double Double; and the \secret\"" items.     :-)  Today I had a Double Double Burger with everything & of course it was great; as was the generous serving of Fries; which I always order well done.  That way they're nice & crispy but retain the great potato-y taste that we get from In-N-Out fries because they don't blanch them!  They just put them through the slicer; right into the hot; fresh oil & cook them straight through until they're done.  No seasoning except a little fine salt to bring out the pure potato taste.  Yum!  Prices?  Still great!  Double Double $3.30; Fries $1.50.  5 Stars?  Of course!     :-))""",1

dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,"When this place first opened I was a bit concerned because the level of customer service at ANY store near or inside Metrocenter usually leaves much to be desired. However I must say that IN-N-Out has defied the odds and continues to impress me with the way they run their business. Friendly employees; fresh food; and great service are the reasons I continue to visit there (even though I loathe Metrocenter overall). Think about this; they dispatch a person outside to take orders if the drive thru line is too long to make sure your order gets in and you don't leave frustrated.  Really.   Would ANY other place do that? Not a chance. Also; out of all the times I have been there; they have NEVER gotten my order wrong. I am a bit picky with my food and I never have to worry; I can trust them to get it right the first time. The employees are CLEARLY paid better wages than other burger joints which means something to me as well. They are happy to be there (for the most part) and this is evident in the level of service they provide.   My ONLY; and I mean only critique of this In-N-Out Burger location is the shall we say; interesting; way the drive thru is set up. Series of cones to direct you in and when you get out you are in a parking lot of Burlington Coat Factory with many people (usually) walking in the lot. Other than that; this place is a great place to stop in and grab a burger.   Oh and the inside is constantly being cleaned up and I have not seen a \bad\"" time to go there. Obviously pretty much always busy; but that is to be expected for the service they provide and the excellent food they make.""",1

dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,After a long day watching the Dodgers at Camelback Ranch and watching a movie at the Glendale Drive-In; you'll get hungry! With me being hundreds of miles away from Los Angeles; there is no better place to grab a late night snack than at In-N-Out in Phoenix.  Located on the shopping center with Michael's and Staples on 28th & Peoria; you'll find SoCal's famous In-N-Out in Arizona. A couple hours earlier; there was a car crash and on that intersection and tons of local law enforcement. When I came back around 12am; there were a lot of Arizona Highway Patrol cars at the In-N-Out. It looks like a lot of them were taking their break. There were even more when I left. I didn't eat in since there were more coming in. I guess you can call this a temporary HQ for the Arizona Highway Patrol.  It had been awhile since I ate anything at In-N-Out. So; I ordered what I use to order: a 3x3 Burger ($4.35) with everything on it and Animal Style French Fries ($3.50). I didn't realize that the Animal Fries was put into the microwave with the cheese. If I have to describe what it tastes like; then you really need to add In-N-Out to your bucket list.   Yeah; there are tons of Sonic locations; but if there is an In-N-Out; you know where my priorities lie! I still dream of a 100x100 challenge; but I am not sure if I want to add that to my things to do. Maybe I'll keep trying out more of their not-so secret menu.  Do you think I write too much? Well; you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!,0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,I went to in-n-out burger on 27th Avenue Peoria and had the worst experience I've ever had at one of their locations my burger was not only sloppy but the lady that taking the order at the drive thru window was very rude and obnoxious and made me very angry I would never go back or recommend any of my friends to go there to that location ever.,0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,The employees here always have such great attitudes I would come here just for the service if the the burgers weren't so amazing,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,We were visiting from out of town and had to introduce In & Out to the kids.  Big hit!  Great place for the occasional; but always pleasing; burger and fries.  Only gripe is the small size of the burger patty - adults should probably opt for double patty.    We love the simple menu; fresh cut fries; and service.  Plenty of staff on hand.  Clean store.   Build some in Atlanta!,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,So there is only one thing that stops me from being a Vegan- Wait for it; Yelp; you guessed it- hamburgers. Ok; maybe not just one thing but burgers are certainly high up there on the list. Love me a good burger. Sorry cows. Yes I do love animals but my willpower fails me when it comes to a great juicy meat patty. But I digress. In regards to INOB Frankly; everyone raves about this place and I never got it. There are so many better hamburgers in town.  All the times I went here did not leave a memorable impression in my brain; good or bad. sooooooooo; when I saw they opened one more centrally located I decided to go again with the soul purpose of writing a review. (Hmmmm that's a switch for foodie Mary here who usually only goes to eat first and write second)     INOB is known for using real meat and not processed patty garbage- so give them a check on the positive. ( And they might be one of the few fast food restaurants that uses real food) In N Out is know for their wonderful hiring procedures and employee and employer relations. (gotta love that in today's day and age) - another check- INOB burgers cost under 5 bucks and a little bit over for a combo- WOWZA checkmate! (Mary does not like paying 10- 15 dollars for a good hamburger. She will; haha; but doesn't like to)     Ok; so now onto the negative-( Sigh; I know but I have to share)  Crazy busy places make me nervous and messes up the shopping center parking lot when I need to got to Michael's- check minus for almost getting hit five times getting there today.  French Fries-ewhhhhh! Why were they cold if they serve them fresh? I know I am very picky about temperature and fries.I don't eat fries to much anymore so I want them to be really good when I indulge because I hate to throw them out and waste food and money. They just aren't that good here- check minus.     And now onto the golden reason I liked today's visit the best----- It was the customer service!( big roar in the background inserted here)  Jeepers Kreepers INOB staff members can ya keep the smileage down please? Do you have to be so nice? LOL! I swear they send the staff to happy; friendly; excellent customer service college. They are all very nice and give service with a smile. Eye contact and everything. (Makes the longer wait a little but more manageable)  It is amazing how they beat out the others by a mile in this dept. Even better than some fancy restaurants.     So in conclusion; is INOB the best burger in town- no far from it. Is it good- yes. Is it the best burger for fast food under 15 bucks -HMMMMMMM; well you decide. I'll never tell. But to tell you my secret It is in my two top favorites. You will have to guess which one I like more. I do admit my favorite though comes nowhere close in the Customer Service dept and the Phoenix locations can't match the back east versions. So with that said many of my Westerner Peeps might end up picking INOB as their first choice. So; enjoy and be happy there is finally one more centrally located. And from the line out the door I think it is about time.   PS- you might want to tell them to hold the onions though. Wehhhh 6 hours later and my breath is still reliving the experience.,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,"I should probably start by saying.. I am pregnant and had been looking forward to this CHEESE burger all day. I ordered ONE CHEESE burger WITH onion... And a French fry. Lady asked if I will be eating in the car; I said No.. She says \okay we will bag that for you.\"" Great. I get to the window... Lady tries handing me a box of food. I said no... I need that bagged.. She acted put off By it. I get home.. Still excited.. Open my burger... It's a patty; bread and lettuce..... Clearly not what I ordered. Receipt CLEARLY says what I ordered. I'll keep driving a little further to bell rd. I attached a picture for a visual. Ha. Not happy""",0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,It's been a while since I've had In N Out; so yesterday I decided to stop by for lunch. I had been to the dentist earlier that morning & my teeth were still hurtin; so I decided to avoid any long drive thru lines & go after the lunch rush at about a quarter till 2pm. When I pulled up there was still a bit of a wait; about 6 or 7 cars were in front of me. I can only imagine how long that line gets at noon! Any way; I ordered a #2 animal style with a dr. pepper. Everything was so tasty & I finished it all! Total for a cheeseburger; medium drink & fries was less than 6 bucks; so awesome. Best fast food burger by far!  P.S. I love how pleasant the employees working at In N Out are; it's very refreshing :),1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,For fast food burgers; this is indeed quite good. This location is a welcome shot in the arm for Metro Square and the MetroCenter area. The burgers and fries were good; the service friendly and quite fast. Four and a half stars; but I'm bumping it up to 5 because the staff was able to manage the madness of opening day well - including the long queue of cars at the drive-thru.,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,What a great place! Double double animal style with fries; really nothing on earth can beat that. Service is prompt; food came out hot and delicious and the restaurant is clean and spacious. Definitely a great place to grab a burger!,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,I didn't mean to do it. I created a monster. The Buddha asks for In n Out at least once a week now. Animal fries; shakes; the whole shebang! It's cool though. We don't eat fast food too often and I love it almost as much as he does. Plus this is kind of our drive in movie staple. We always order the same thing and we always get way too full. The service here is touch and go at best. Everyone is friendly enough the majority of the time...    Aside from the service; I can't differentiate much on this location from others. They are all relatively the same. Pretty consistent on preparation and store design.   Yum. I want animal fries now.,1

dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Missing California; it was almost instantaneous that In N Out would curb the homesickness.   Came here for a late dinner and got a hamburger; grilled onions; protein style and a drink. This is a my go-to order; upon eating I noticed that the burger had animal sauce which I think is weird because typically if you get a burger protein style you would leave out the animal sauce as a given. The sauce pretty much defeats the purpose of getting it protein style; so that kind of bugged me. I guess I'll just ask them specifically for no sauce next time. I like that they keep the spicy peppers for self-serving next to the ketchup dispensers.  Other than that; food came out quickly; service was quick; though it was pretty packed in the place for a late afternoon on a weekday.,1

dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Ok; so far in my life and all of the burger joints I have been this was takes the cake. In and Out is a trifecta great taste; top of the line ingredients and amazing prices. When you walk in the door it is extremely clean and the staff are wearing the burger uniforms of olden days. Walking up to the counter you will find a menu with minimal choices but not bad choices. As you order you can visibly watch them fresh cut the fries and make your mouth watering burger. I lived in Arizona for two years and now the I'm back on the East Coast; I really wish we had them here!,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,"This is very much a review of this location and not the chain.   It would be nice if the busy periods where they have an order taker outside was done with a bit more courtesy;\what do you want\""  wouldn't be it. Small enough to ignore but add in the fact diet soda has never been root beer; my kids hamburger with only ketchup/tomato now = cheeseburger.Nice one.   Also these have to be the worst travelling burgers re their heat retention. I live pretty close and it wasn't remotely as good as eating it right there; e.g; 3 minutes is a long time in the desirability of this food.   So that's 1 order; 3 things wrong it's like they think they are fricking Wendy's or something:)""",0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,So about once every 2-3 months I get a craving that only In n Out can satisfy. A # 2 or # 3 Animal Style with grilled AND fresh onions; with a root beer to drink. Occasionally I'll order the fries well done but usually just let them cook them normally.   Ohhh man...while not the best burger ever; when given the choice of fast food burger joints I will choose In n Out at least  90% of the time.   This location is one of the newest in the Valley and conveniently located off I-17 on the North side of Peoria Ave.  The service is as friendly and professional as any of their other locations.,1

dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,This In N Out Burger is the best thing about this rather depressing part of Phoenix. I stayed in the area for two nights solely based on the proximity to an In N Out Burger.   The place is spotlessly clean; and everyone is extremely friendly. We ordered cheeseburgers and fries and chocolate shakes. Everything was great; I was stuffed. It's always fun to eat fast food you can't get at home. A great first time visit!,0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,"The food; really good; especially for the price. I noticed a few \yelpers\"" prefer McDonald's over this place. My only comment to them is that these same folks would probably eat dog crap if you put syrup on it and call it tasty.  Those people obviously have never had a good hamburger. McDonald's is the bottom of the barrel guys; IN-N-OUT is the creme de la creme. Anyway; I always order mine special; (no sauce; add mustard and extra mustard on the side). It's always correct. The only drawback is the parking lot and not enough tables inside the restaurant to comfortably seat everyone at the busy lunch time. (Saw some folks waiting to find a table and they ended up eating outside due to nowhere to sit inside). IN-N-OUT might want to make the restroom area smaller and increase the inside dining area. Other than that; the food was great and the price was more than reasonable. I also appreciated the good customer service. Very rare these days.""",1

dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,New location at Metrocenter mall; just like iain B. said....this area needs a stimulus in a bad way.  It is close to my office as well so I am happy to have this location nearby.  The burgers here are consistently great for the value.  I actually crave the consistent flavor of the special sauce; I tried the double burger yesterday but I have to say that the single patty isn't much meat but it is a perfect amount because it tastes great and of course I am consuming less red meat....which my wife tells me I have a problem; ha ha.  Anyway; great food; great service; great value ($5 combo meal); and now close to work.  Yippee!,1
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,We stopped on the way from Sedona to the Phoenix Airport on the way back from honeymoon. This was my first time eating In N Out and it was delicious.  The burger was the best fast food burger I have ever had... It's all about the cheese and sauce.  Coming from a land of disgusting fast food and people too lazy to get out of their cars; I was shocked that the restaurant was so busy.  People were piled in there waiting for food and tables.   We would have had a table sooner if it weren't for the people sitting next to it with their knives out and open just laying on the table.  They were weirdly eyeing everyone.  I would think that a manager would ask them to put their weapons away but I guess they didn't want to be stabbed either.   Otherwise; we enjoyed our food and met another couple there from Tennessee trying it for the first time too.  That was neat! I would definitely come back here again and order an even bigger burger.,0
dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Always friendly and great food but the person working the last window through the drive-through messed up....he just gave me my order and didn't repeat back what it was and seemed in a hurry to do something else than take the time for the customer at the drive-through. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.,1
-7smFzvh2E2fOOYs-0Dl8w,I love Chipotle's food and the fact that they are hormone-free in their ingredients. But I received the worst service at this location. When the employee refilled the salad lettuce; he spilled and replaced it back in the bowl and served it onto someone's salad. My sour cream had hair in it and the cashier was not attentive to my order; which led to an overpayment. The  employees' attitudes were very careless and a majority; not all; treated their customers with little respect. Very displeased with this location.,0

-7smFzvh2E2fOOYs-0Dl8w,This is my GO-TO place for a Paleo-style lunch or dinner that gives nice big portions; keeps everything fresh and juicy; and doesn't put much of a dent in the ol' wallet.  Favorite meal:  carnitas salad bowl with all the veggies no dairy and a lil' bit of guac  I don't know if every Chipotle is like this; but every now and then one of the employees will work the dining room and refill drinks or give a little extra service.  That's nice and they are pretty friendly when you walk in the door; too.  Even though they're mostly behind the counter.  Can't lose here!,1
-7smFzvh2E2fOOYs-0Dl8w,This location is a relatively newer location. I just to go to the power location; but this one is a little closer for me. I like this one much more than the other location service is always good. Sometimes the line can be long but they usually go through it pretty well. Besides that salad bowls are always awesome.,1

The BREAD: soft; flaky and fresh. The MEAT: sliced fresh for every sandwhich. The toppings...different and very good.  You can order your sub \mikes way\"" and it will come with lettuce; tomatoes; white onion & LOTS of (too much imo) oil and vinegar... as for the prices;  i think the people complaing about an 11.00 samdwhich are failing to mention;  that size sandwhich is literally 3 meals!

You can get the mini which is plenty of food for ME (probably not enough  if your a guy or have a hefty appetite ) for under 5 bucks. One thing that constantly keeps me coming back is the customer service. I would much rather spend my $ in a place that takes pride in it's customer service;  listens; and gives you what you asked for than any other mediocre serviced sub shop offering a 5.00 footlong and an attitude.

1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Forget about other sub shops - Jersey Mike's is the BEST! They cut the meat and cheese fresh when you order your sub - everything is fresh and delicious every single time I go to Jersey Mike's! I read other reviews about it being expensive - here's the deal - you get what you pay for. Jersey Mike's has quality food and excellent service - well worth paying a little extra for! Tip: Get your sub and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours - the flavors melt together and become even more amazing :),1

1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Good sub but on the expensive side. Also they don't have Fries!! And everytime someone orders a hot sub the entire staff yells HOT STUFF!  It's frickin Annoying! !!!!!!!!!! And serves no purpose! Quit it!,0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,I love your subs ; but I went in there and saw many flies ; so I kindly told the worker ; I was not ordering because of all the flies and walked out... ekk gross.,0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.,0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,JERSEY MIKE'S IS EXPENSIVE FOR A SANDWICH SHOP! Just letting you know that right off the bat if you have yet to go there. Not quite sure what makes their ingredients so much different from the rest that's on planet Earth to warrant their pricing. But I digress. Beyond that the sub I had was very good. I tried the large chicken Parmesan (which will throw you back alittle over $11. That's just for the sandwich. So yeah; the people that work there probably have to work 2 hours to afford a sandwich there.) and I was not disappointed one bit. The only problem I had when I first got there was how to order. I thought it was like Subway so I was expecting them to ask me what I wanted on it while they were making it. But they just made it and wrapped it up without asking me what else I wanted on it. So word to the wise. Make sure u know exactly what you want on it the moment you order.,0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Went there today because I'm trying to check out the eateries in my new neighborhood and it's hard to find a good sub. Ordered the giant club sub. Unfortunately I was running errands and it ended up sitting in the back seat of my car for well over an hour. Still; it was a great sub. Good bread; fresh meat that isn't slimy and questionable like at some places and lots of ingredients. I can't wait to try some of the other sandwiches on the menu.  Update: Also have tried the meatball sub and Philly cheese steak; both were excellent.,0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,seriously... these are some gosh-dang-good-subs! My dad is from Philly and I was raised hearing stories about the legendary 'hoagies' that he had the privilege of enjoying in his youth (he had went on and on about them so much; that I almost felt like I could taste them :) and then one day... I did taste them; at Jersey Mikes! The fresh baked bread; the sliced to order meats and cheeses (we're not talking Blimpies here!) these sandwiches are legit! I always order mine 'Mike's way' which includes oil; vinegar; spices; lettuce; tomatoes and thinly sliced onion- then I add the hot cherry pepper relish; omg! so good! Stick with the cold subs... I have tried a few on the hot side of the menu (cheese steaks and reubens) and while they are ok; I have always regretted it and wished I was eating one of the awesome choices on the cold side (#2 and #5 are the best!),0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Yes; there are a ton of choices if you're looking for a quick bite while shopping at the Happy Valley Towne Center; but if you're in the mood for a quick sandwich then Jersey Mikes is always a safe bet. As far as chain sandwich shops in the area go; the Js (Jersey Mikes and Jimmie Johns) always seem to rise to top. Jersey Mikes always delivers fresh and satisfying sandwiches. I think the key is their fresh bread and generous dollops of mayonnaise. If I'm in a healthy (guilty) mood; then I usually go with a simple #7 - the turkey and provolone; piled with veggies and light on the mayo. If I'm feeling like I want to indulge; I go with the #13 Italian with extra onions.  I have never been disappointed at Jersey Mikes....though their numbering system does leave me a bit confused....Next time; I'll order a #4 and see what I get!,0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,First time at Jersey Mike's; When you order online;  they make your sandwich the exact opposite of what you ordered -  it's great!  We ordered an Italian and a Club;  no onion; no mayo;  add banana peppers and pickles. We received an Italian and a Turkey;  covered in onions and mayo;  no banana peppers or pickles on soggy bread.  Didn't discover it until I got home.  Never again.  I'll stick to Jimmy Johns or Goodcents.,0
1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,First time at Jersey Mikes today. Arrived at 11:45 for lunch and there were a dozen guests plus three in line.   I ordered a regular Italian with no frills for $7.80 with tax. The service was efficient if a bit fast. Seemed they were competing with Jimmy Johns for speed. I like my meal in a hurry but I don't like to be rushed. The guy in line behind me was completely flustered since they talk so fast you can't hear or understand them. They also had to add some condiments to my sub that they had missed.   On to the food: the bread was fresh; baked just right with a slightly crunchy crust and soft middle. The veggies were crisp and the meat/cheese were sliced to order. The portions seemed a bit slight compared to Port of Subs but there were options; like pepper relish; that POS doesn't offer.   I will return to JM again and try a hot sandwich.,1

There were so many customers at 3 P.M. on a Friday that people dining in had to wait and keep an eagle eye on tables to open up. After trying in vain to acquire 3 tables with no avail; I finally snagged one after maneuvering my way to a table whose patrons had just left.  Even though we were eating at a fast food restaurant; I appreciated the fact that they had a staff member on hand only to clean up; wipe down tables; and take away trays as needed. He was very friendly and attentive.  As for the food; consistently good as always. My personal favorite to order is a protein and animal style burger with well done fries!,1

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,I am forever impressed when I first walk into any In-N-Out. The complete undeviating white and overall look of cleanliness is not lost on me. I've never seen an employee with a huge grease stain on their shirt or apron. All of them look super crisp and freshly pressed; shirts tucked in; black belts; girls with an oversized safety pin holding their apron closed. I couldn't tell you if any of the female employees there have long hair or not since they all have it neatly tucked into their caps. Ah. . . . I love walking into a clean looking place. I realize that a company that goes to those lengths to make sure of their employees appearance; must also be keen on quality.  I gladly ordered my double-double; fries and a coke. (yes; I can actually finish a double- double here. -blushing) You can taste the quality at first bite. Everything tastes fresh and natural. Delicious. No soggy; faded lettuce or frail tomatoes; just fresh; crunchy vegetables. Yummmm . . . then the fries . . . . those little golden sticks of heaven. They feel so airy light but tasty at the same time. My goodness. Just thinking about my meal makes me want to go again. I know I will. Soon.,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,"What can I say. I am a hamburger slut. When I lived in Seattle I pined for the mecca of In-N-Out. Definitely a plus to moving to the Phoenix area.  Here are 2 major things I like about In-N-Out in in general: protein style and the fries.   I've eaten at this location; oh; hmmm.. a \few\"" times now. I have noticed some quality differences. Sometimes the fries are a little dry. Or a little mushy (which is exactly how I like them actually.) Sometimes my burger tastes a little bit like onions (which I like) and sometimes it doesn't. I've tried ordering w/onions and w/grilled onions but it doesn't give it the same taste. Sometimes the tomatoes suck and I take 'em off.   Those inconsistencies are what is adding up to this place not getting 5 stars. But; of course; I'll be back.""",0

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,"There are a number of In-n-Out's around town at this point and; though it seems like everyone knows the 411 on this wonderful chain of delicious burgerness; we should keep in mind that our neighbors to the east may have never been to one.   So here's the deal: the menu has three different items; in a few different sizes. Those items are burgers; fries; and shakes. The burger can be a single patty cheese burger or a double; and the fries can be medium or large. Nothing really too complicated here; folks.   What will catch a first-time In-n-Outer off guard is how goddam delicious it all is. Greasy; yes; but they do use fresh veggie oil for fries and cut the potatoes in house.   There is also the famous \Secret Menu\"" that isn't posted in the restaurant. I am semi-familiar with it but it is mostly comprised of specialty orders; like grilled onions for your burger; called \""Animal Style;\"" or easier ways of calling out if you want extra tomatoes; or in the case of lettuce instead of the bun \""protein style.\"" Also; for a bigger burger (more than two patties) call it a 3 by 3 for three patties; 4 x 4 for four; etc.  The owners of the chain have been extremely careful with franchising and supposedly are keeping the owners within the family. Also; there is a widespread theory that the owners are Mormon; evidenced by Biblical citations on the bottom of drink cups and underneath fry baskets.  If that is true; that's just one more reason that Jesus would give these tasty burgers two thumbs up!""",0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,"Ah; In-N-Out.  It was September 6; 1950; & my dad scored a new Powder Blue '51 Chevy Convertible to surprise my mom with for her Birthday.  She put me & the big pink ribbon & bow inside; & we took off; hair in the wind; down Baldwin Ave. to Highway 66 & east over to In-N-Out; in nearby Baldwin Park.  This was to be not only my first ride in a convertible & my first hamburger; but I think also my first meal ever at a restaurant!  (Mom learned that 3-year-olds don't like raw onions!)  This was not only the first In-N-Out; but it might have been the only \fast food\"" drive-in restaurant anywhere at the time!  Highway 66 is gone now; but amazingly; that In-N-Out is still there; & the regular burgers & fries haven't changed a bit!  (\""Old 66\"" here is now the service road for the 10 Freeway.)  Hamburger (Animal Style) $1.75; Fries (Well Done) $1.35; Chocolate Shake $1.95=$5.05  Yes; we have 5 Guys & Smashburger; & they're both great; but they're not the same thing.  The magic is at In-N-Out.  Special Magic!!     :-))""",0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Still love this In-N-Out; & all of them!  Finally made it back here today; joined by Mike C. and Jackie R.  I went with a Double Double (Cheeseburger); a Fries (well done) and a Chocolate Shake.  All were just great; there wasn't much of a line to order at about 11 this morning; and we got comfortable indoor booth seating without waiting.  (Please refer to my previous Review below for more info.)  Todays prices were:  Double Double $3.35; Fries $1.60; Chocolate Shake $2.10=$7.05  ...an amazing lunch for the money; as always; at this terrific family owned non-franchise burger chain!     :-)),0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,I love the food here.  I first had their food when I was in Las Vegas (i know.. not in LA) and the place was jam packed with people.  I think what makes this place so great is how simple it is.  Burgers and Fries.. that's it!    In-N-Out has the best fries out there.  Super fresh every time you order.  I mean dont get me wrong.. i love a good McDOnalds fry every now and then; but if you want fresh; this is the place.  Ive never actually been inside this one; but always do drive-thru,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Delicious food. Friendly and super speedy service. The only problem is the rude people who don't understand how a drive thru line works! LOL!,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,"I love this place. One of my favorite burger joints. I have been to In N Outs before but recently friends have exposed my to the \secret\"" menu. Double Doubles are great but they are awesome when you get them animal style. 3X3 animal style forget about it. I have died and gone to cheeseburger heaven. Also love the fact that this one is close to work and home.  Such a simple menu; burgers; fries; shakes and drinks but it is when you get into the customization that you find the magic of In N Out. Animal style burgers; grilled cheese sandwiches; animal style fries; etc. The combinations expand so much just by adding a few simple things to an already simple menu.  The staff is awesome too. No one ever seems to have a bad day and be grumpy. They are always in a great mood. It borders on creepy because everyone who works there is so nice and looks like they are from the 50s. It borders on the Stepford Wives almost. Maybe we are just so used to less than perfect service that when we get great service we don't know how to handle it.  Can't go wrong with a 3X3 animal style; fries and a chocolate shake. Love it. Best place ever.""",1

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,This is a tough review to write because different things deserve different ratings.    The food: Five Stars; hands down.  I always get the grilled cheese with grilled onions (it's on their not-so-secret secret menu).    The space itself: One and a half stars.  Woah; wait; what?  This is In-N-Out; right?  What gives?    We stopped in here after spending 13 hours in the car (I wouldn't recommend doing this) and it was 9:30 on a Monday night.  We were exhausted and famished and we both knew In-N-Out would hit the spot.    Upon entering; we were greeted promptly and our order was taken precisely and in record time; and after that is when it all went downhill.  The lobby was a mess- the tables were dirty; trash everywhere and an employee went out to collect the empty baskets; but that was it- he didn't clean any tables!  I needed to relieve myself of the abundance of caffeine I'd consumed on the road and the women's restroom was even worse.  Both stalls were out of toilet paper (thanks; Mom; for always telling me to carry kleenex with me wherever I go!) and there was trash everywhere.  Seriously; I've seen cleaner restrooms at a gas station in Blythe.    Next time I'll probably just hit the drive through.....,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,cant go wrong with a Double Double; fries; and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once; called the corporate office; they sent out some gift cards for our meals; then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,In-N-Out is the hands down best franchise/chain burger joint around.    A simple no-frills menu means that they can concentrate on providing the freshest; highest quality ingredients; such as crisp lettuce; fresh tomatoes;  never frozen patties and fresh cut fries cooked in clean oil.   Also the free refills on drinks is great; especially during summer in Phoenix.  Decor wise; In-N-Out keeps it clean and classic; like the burger joints of yore.

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,"When I first moved to Phoenix to live with my boyfriend I asked him to take me to In-N-Out since everyone seems to love this chain so much. When we went I just got a regular burger and my boyfriend got an animal style one; my boyfriend also mentioned that their fries are kinda soggy and gross so we ordered them well done.  Anyways my excitement quickly diminished when I took my first bite; I was just like; \Ew this is what all the excitement's about?\""; I was starting to wonder if people in the west have never had a decent burger!  My burger was boring and just whatever; I've had better fast food. My BF's tasted like burnt mustard; pretty gross. The fries apparently were a lot better well done but still totally bland..they tasted like something you could get from the freezer section at any grocery store.  Other than that the place was kinda dirty; maybe we got there after a rush; but the employees were all super nice!  Maybe I'll go and give them another try sometime..but I'm hesitant.""",1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,The service at this In and Out was absolutely took notch. You would swear you were actually in a restaurant with a server. Kevin one of the attendants or servers so was pleasant and nice but also went around to ask each table how their meal was and throw finished items away. Super impressed! Great recruiting In and Out the service was great.,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Price was right. Cool concept but I like 5 guys better. What A Burger is my favorite burger; guess you could say I'm old school. In and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. A lot of hype.,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,I reserve my good as it gets for Shake and Shake...The holy grail of burgers! Now if they would just build one in AZ!   I love a good burger and as far as fast food this one is in my top 5 although it is the fresh cut fries that put In & Out in the top for me.   The list is as follows:   1 Steak N Shake: Mustard pickle onion only! No cheese; No tomato lettuce or MAYO UGH. You are ruining it by adding anything but the 1st three condiments. I am a purest.   2 In & Out: Light sauce add onions! Yum Well done French Fries please.   3 Whataburger: I love the A1 thick and hearty burger otherwise it's the double cheese with mustard and onion only.   4 Carls Jr: The superstar does me just fine! This would be my # 3 if they had good fries to go with that flame broiled burger but they have rockin onion rings!   5 Wendy and Burger King: They are in a tie for 5. I love the fresh never frozen burgers from Wendy's but the King had me at flame broiled. Although BK's Fries are NASTY and the onion rings have no onion in them WTF!?   I do enjoy the fresh toppings and delicious fries at In and Out. I also quite like to watch my food being prepared so I know there have been no shenanigan's!   If you really want to treat yourself get a double double with onion of course and then an order of fries well done. I add vinegar to my fries and they are out of this world delicious! Now go eat a burger I'm done talking to you.,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Love this place! I only go about once a year; but when I'm feeling like fast food I wait it out here for the cheeseburger with grilled onions protein style with lots of fries and ketchup!!  The lines are sometimes overwhelming; but the staff has it under control and they move through the orders pretty quickly.  The hardest part about eating here is finding a table!,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Always have been a fan of In n Out. This is my favorite location. Speedy; friendly service; consistently excellent food; and close to my work and home easily accessible from the road.

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Wow this location is super busy. This is especially true at lunch time. I love that they have someone outside taking orders so that you can breeze through the drive thru even when the line is ten cars deep. They do a good job keeping it clean. The food is always amazing and never disappoints. I will come back very often.,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Well In-N-Out burger you have one hell of a burger... I have been eating at this location for years and never had a bad meal I want to go get it right now as I write this... Many might not know about the secret menu I put this to the test my last visit and sure enough they knew about it all. So on you next visit you will have a whole new experience... Try this site for new menu options: http://www.badmouth.net/in-n-outs-secret-menu/   I was happy I did we were able to order a Neapolitan shake it rocked and the Animal Style Fries off the chart... You need to do everything Animal Style anyways... Great burger place I will be back many times I know it.,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,It's true : Having grown up in California; I love me some In-N-Out!  It's definitely over hyped; but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around; make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy.   They pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts; which explains the fabulous customer service.   Haha; give me a break; it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently.   Seeing as this In-N-Out is by my office; it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young; dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees.   Dropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style; Protein Style; Extra Crispy Fries.  Kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her.   I asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me.   When I looked at my receipt; I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order; and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this.   Usually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin; ZERO stars for Kayla.   I don't come here very much; but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.  Sorry for the two star rating; In-N-Out; but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together.,0

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Had my first experience with a In-N-Out grilled cheese today with grilled onions. Amazing! A must try if you love cheese! Look up the secret menu online before going in to find many more tasty gems. Service was fantastic as usual. Overall great! Love me some In-N-Out!,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Came to this location with a friend and we had an enjoyable lunch. We placed our order; got our drinks; and were on a quest for a table; and a gentleman offered us his as he was leaving. The table had barely been used and was still clean; so we seized the opportunity. The place was packed; as it was lunchtime; but within 5-7 minutes; we had our food; hot and fresh.   I had my usual; the #3 combo and shared my fries with my friend. She had a burger and asked for grilled onions; only without the secret sauce...slightly Animal Style perhaps...and a milkshake to go with. Our food was just the way we like it and we ate and caught up on things with one another. We were no sooner done and one of the workers asked if he could take our tray and trash away. Talk about efficient service! They are on the ball with cleanup as well.   I love this location; being it's not all that far from home. I can never say no ti In-N-Out Burger...it's a longtime fave and each time family members of mine visit from out of state; we make it a point to go there since they are fans as well.,1

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,This is soooo worth the detour when I travel from Phoenix to the East Valley. A very simple menu; delicious burgers; fresh-cut fries; great service. I hope to learn one day what the secret menu is; but until then I'm happy with the things I get from the regular menu.,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,THE WORST experience of my life! The service was good and fast but the food tasted like has been frozen for years! Remember the hot dog  commercials back in the day where they advertised that the hot dog would fit in the bun? Well maybe they should of sold one to In-N-Out Burger! The burger filled about half to 60% of the bun. Also the milk shake I got was basically ice cream in a cup. The hype is way over rated! I will never set foot in one again it's not like we don't have enough burger joints to chose from! Two thumbs down!,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Best fast food restaurant.  Great service.  Fresh food.  Love the grilled cheese with grilled and raw onions and minimal sauce.  The fries are great when they are hot.  Fresh brewed iced tea with fresh big chunks of lemon.  Mmmm.... I could eat here everyday.,1

3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,"I secretly moved back to this area of the country strictly for the In-N-Out Burger factor.. Nothing anywhere compares to it. In fact; after my last visit I was reminded how perfectly delicious it is and I am changing my last meal on earth to an animal style burger; well done fries and a Neapolitan milkshake. It really is the American dream.  I am always fascinated when I walk into any on of their establishments. Always clean yet so disorderly.. The lines are always retarded long; and there are always people standing everywhere; but somehow they never fail to deliver every meal hot; fresh; delicious and FAST. I have NEVER encountered a broken ATM inside either.  Not everyone is aware of their \secret menu\""; with items such as the 2x4; flying Dutchman; the protein style burger and my fave; animal style... In fact; the secret items actually outnumber the items legitimately on the menu which only consists of a Hamburger; Cheeseburger; Double-Double; French Fries; Coca-Cola products and three shakes: chocolate; vanilla and strawberry; of course. I'm pretty sure you can download a PDF of their menu somewhere online; but even if you don't know the terms; the employees at In-N-Out will pretty much do anything to a burger if you ask them.. I also recommend the fries well done.. otherwise they are kind of soggy.   Now I am hungry; I think I've decided whats for lunch!""",1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Always a great burger.  They are hot; juicy and delicious.    They lost a star for having someone yelling order numbers over the intercom all lunch hour.  I've been here several times and never seen them do that.  It was annoyingly loud and distracting.  Oh well; the food is still fabulous.,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,This is a very popular location and I can see why! The food was consistent with Traditional In-N-Out Burger. Customer service was great! The good was very good! We got good seating and parking! No complaints!,1
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,No In-N-Out in Oregon.  Which is probably a good thing; or I'd be weighing in around 3 bills right now.  When I visit the Southwest; a trip to In-N-Out is always a must.  For burgers and fries it's really tough to beat.  Here's another thing I love about it (which I've never seen anywhere else):  when there's a long line at the Drive Thru; they'll send a kid out with an electronic ordering gizmo; who walks out to your car and gets you going on your order.  Genius!  That way your order gets a head start and you (and everyone behind you) aren't waiting for days at the window.,0
3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Fantastic fast food. The fries are freshly sliced when you order them and not too salty.  But it's the secret menu burgers that make it so hard to live so far from an In-N-Out Burger.  Order a Double Double; Animal style and you'll understand why these are my favorite fast food burgers.  I miss In-N-Out with a passion.,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,I stopped eating hamburger meat a little over a year ago. I really miss cheeseburgers.   Q: What's a girl to do?? A: Go to In-N-Out; and order a 'grilled cheese; animal style'.   I just found out that you can basically get a cheeseburger without the beef patty. It comes with lettuce and tomato;(in my version; they held the lettuce) 2 slices o' cheese; grilled onions; slathered in their awesome sauce.  Yay! It really tastes like the cheeseburgers I remember.    If that sounds good to you; you can order 'animal style' fries; they come loaded with cheese; onions and the sauce.  Freakin' delicious.,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,"Dear In-and-Out;    Your spread is delicious. Your \hidden\"" menu makes me feel slick when I order a 3x3 animal style. Your fries are.. okay. Your shakes are milky dreams flowing forth into my gullet to wash down that delicious mustard-fried patty I jammed into my facehole. BUT; you'll my heart belongs to another.. another 5 in fact (wink wink). So I guess this daliance will have to remain just that. An affair for a short time. Maybe we can share numbers? You can B-ext me pics of your various stages of lettuce; pickles; and buns; knowing all the well I'll be back in your neck of the woods some day... But for now; We'lll always have Phoenix.. Good bye...""",0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,I admit it -- I had high expectations going to In-N-Out for the first time. I heard great things about their burgers; and I was hoping to get blown away. I was not. Now on the plus side; I love watching whole potatoes get smashed through the french fry press. That alone was worth the price of the meal. In fact; I'd love to get one of those for my house. But the burgers? Not so much. I ordered the double-double; and it was OK; but not really unique or outstanding in any way I could taste. For my money; a Big Mac is not something I can easily replicate at home (unlike the double-double); and the Burger King Whopper just tastes better. But that's just my two cents. I didn't hate it; but I certainly can live without it.,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,"The first time I ate at In-N-Out was when the chain first popped up in the Phoenix area. I wasn't too impressed. I had a plain cheeseburger; and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu.   I went in again to try their burgers again; this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style; with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat; melted cheese; crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go; because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger; extra pickles; and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.  Compared to other fast food chains; you get a really good value for your meal here. The extra ingredients for \animal style\"" don't cost any extra; and the burger meat tastes way better than something similar for the same price elsewhere. The veggies were very fresh; as opposed to the wilted veggies you find in some places from burgers sitting out on heat lamps for who knows how long.  The neopolitan shake was pretty tasty. It's another \""secret menu\"" item; and while I've never had a chocolate; strawberry; and vanilla shake all in one; this will not be my last!  I wasn't too impressed with the fries; despite being freshly cut and fried. They tasted a bit dry and crumbly.   Service was very friendly; and the cashier even gave me a cup for water while we waited the few minutes it would take for our meal to be made. Once we were done; another staff member came by to clear our table. Very nice service for a fast food place!""",1
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,"The first time I ate at In-N-Out was when the chain first popped up in the Phoenix area. I wasn't too impressed. I had a plain cheeseburger; and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu.   I went in again to try their burgers again; this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style; with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat; melted cheese; crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go; because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger; extra pickles; and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.  Compared to other fast food chains; you get a really good value for your meal here. The extra ingredients for \animal style\"" don't cost any extra; and the burger meat tastes way better than something similar for the same price elsewhere. The veggies were very fresh; as opposed to the wilted veggies you find in some places from burgers sitting out on heat lamps for who knows how long.  The neopolitan shake was pretty tasty. It's another \""secret menu\"" item; and while I've never had a chocolate; strawberry; and vanilla shake all in one; this will not be my last!  I wasn't too impressed with the fries; despite being freshly cut and fried. They tasted a bit dry and crumbly.

18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,"_________nom_____nom______nom______yessssss_________  1st of All  In-N-Out is the best burger ever not just on the west coast but on EARTH! You just can't forget the TASTE; these will call your name from your burger loving subconscious; saying \NOM ME\""; so taste is 5 Stars; ten even; no; A MEEEEELLION!  These PRICES are better than any fast food place for the quality of food your getting here; for example: The Buns have been Made just for  In-N-Out by Puritan Bakery; which has supplied these buns for In-N-Out Burger since the late 1950s; using only high quality all natural ingredients; They don't have preservatives and are used when fresh; just like everything else at  In-N-Out. This has got to be why it doesn't smell like a fat sweaty trucker (ahem MacDonalds) when you walk in the door; it actually smells like delicious appetizing food! So price and Quality are Tops.  The SERVICE is always atypically friendly; Its like they hire former Disney Characters; Im pretty sure they are like glowing sparkle Fairys or perhaps some other form of semi- Magical people. You just don't get 'tude here; ever. EVER. So staff is excellent.   CLEANLINESS is one of my hang ups; I can spot a speck of ketchup on a wall at 50 yards; or a dust fragment from space; But at this particular  In-N-Out Location; I know they have seriously high scrutiny for cleanliness. My last visit was just yesterday and they had a supervisor literally giving the wallpaper the ol' White Glove treatment; scouring the place for any specks of dirt; lifting up the fake plants and looking under the bins of salt & pepper packages; even searching the window shades for any sign of dirt. The folks behind the counter had White; clean aprons on and the whole place just gleamed with cleanliness. LOVE.   In-N-Out will you marry me?""",1
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,Amazing food; resounding great service; awesome place to stop by if you are in the area!,1
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,"Thank you for an awesome quick meal In-N-Out Burger! I used to eat here all the time in college; but now it is just an occasional \treat\""; need to watch the waistline. Last night there was no food in the house; I got home from work late and I was too tired to go shopping. In-N-Out Burger Saves the Day! The usual long line of cars were in the drive thru; but the line moves fast. We pulled up; placed our order; 3 minutes later I am eating the best burger I have had in a LONG time:) Ahhhh my tummy was happy! I don't like their fries; so I just got a cheese burger and a rootbeer. That was all I needed to satisfy my temporary starvation. My other half had the Double Double and 3 orders of fries (he like the fries; to each their own). Cynthia served us and she was too cute and very nice:) I'll be back in another couple of months! See you then!""",1
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,When we ordered our food it came out great. Then we ordered a burger for our brother at home and it took 15min and it was cold. :( very disappointing,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,Hard to believe this was my first time EVER at In n out. I'm not a huge burger guy; I usually order the chicken at fast food places. Right after I walked in; I knew there was something special about this burger place... The menu board was simple and focused... kinda like Five Guys. I ordered the single cheeseburger animal style with fries. OMG! With my first bite; I was in heaven! The perfectly toasted buns to the grilled onions and secret sauce; I had to slow down to make sure I enjoyed every bite! I washed it down with some strawberry lemonade! I cant wait to come back here more often and try other secret menu items! Think I'll try animal style fries and mustard grilled burgers; or maybe hot peppers added. The possibilities are endless!,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,I grew up in La Verne; CA...home of In-n-out #3. I love in-n-out. However; i give this location a 4/5 because they hardly ever get my order down as I speak it. Most in-n-out locations are quick to understand my order...especially the originals out in CA. I love the food and the staff is great. I just wish they could get my order right without me having to repeat myself a couple of times.,1
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,It's the best of the fast food hamburgers.  I'm not crazy about their fries they're never done enough and I always forget to order them well done.  For the food; I'd only give them 3 stars but they earn the extra star on customer service.  The last 2 times I've gone through the drive-thru they have a real person taking orders.  I love this!  So much better than talking into a speaker.  I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm craving a quick burger.,1

The cheeseburgers taste better here or maybe because I was really craving it. BEST BURGERS EVER! If you haven't tried this place yet; you're missing out!,1
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,Always worth the wait! Great customer service I've been coming here for years and I've never once had my order wrong which is crazy since I'm very specific. I highly recommend coming here don't let the long line discourage you,1

18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,This was my first experience at In and Out. I love that you can order your burger protein style (in lettuce rather than a bun). I thought it was very tasty.,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,Pretty snazzy fries and a decent double double were my companions during this workday; and I must say they were truly good company. Perhaps if I was able to sit down and enjoy my meal rather than have to eat it on the go; I could have savored it much better. But; I'm in the process of streamlining our courier service and had to focus more on the navigation of the driver than this delicious burger and tasty fries; so something might have been lost in translation.  Needless to say; if I ever find myself transferred to our Mesa branch for the day; I know I'll stop by In-N-Out Burger to sate my loins.,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,The young man who took my order at 10 last Sunday night was nice and wanted to talk football because I was wearing a Colts shirt which was nice....friendlier than most...ordered double cheese burger combo....I thiink it was #2 of 3 choices ...could have ordered something from secret menu but just wanted something basic at that time of night...if it wasn't the greasiest burger I've ever had I can't remember when I've eaten anything greasier....not as good as Steak and Shake or Fatburger.,1
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,I LOVE in n out burger; but this particular location kind of lacks.  I order a double double; mustard grilled; no onions with chopped chillies.  My burger came with onions and without chopped chillies.  Also mine and my girlfriends buns were stale.,0
18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,Keep doing what you guys do best; thanks for the great service and quality of food.,1
fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,This is the best location of theirs I've been to.  Great and I mean GREAT customer service from beginning to end.  Kids area is well kept and the staff is very accommodating to the little ones.  I am a big fan of chickfila already; this place just validates my thought process.    Well done!,1
fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,Eat More Chicken  Chick-fil-A is always very clean; surprisingly calm; fast food restaurant with friendly; efficient staff.  The menu at Chick-fil-A has a  wide variety of choices including healthy ones.  In addition; to the great selections from the menu you just can not beat the service.  The employees at Chick-fil-A are nicest folks around.  Attentive to your every whim; and eager to please.     If you decide not to dine in the drive thru provides quick and efficient service on the run and if you decide to dine in - the kids have a place to play while you can sit an relax.   All in all a good meal at reasonable price.,1
fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,After many months of hearing how delicious Chick-fil-A is I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. Since I have never been here before I bought a regular chicken sandwich; chicken nuggets and some waffle fries for my son and I to share so we could try a variety of things.  The service in the drive thru was friendly and quick. I was in and out in no time. The food on the other had left a lot to be desired. To me the fries were a little undercooked but still decent. The chicken nuggets were cooked pretty good and seasoned well. The chicken sandwich was so dry I could barely gag it down. Even after adding some sauce to it; it was still dry. Bottom line it was ok. Nothing I would drive far to get because honestly I could go to Carl's JR and get a better chicken sandwich right by my house. Maybe I expected to much because of how everyone raves about it. I probably won't be back.,1
fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,Love this place! The employees here are all so friendly and they keep the restaurant clean! My son loves to play in the children's play area and that is also very well kept. We enjoy the food and love the service; the drive thru never has a ridiculous wait time either. Very pleased all around.,1
fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,-Fast service! Drive-thru line moves quickly.  -Consistantly friendly service.  -Delicious for being fast food! The quality is way better than Taco Bell or McDonald's.  -Dipping sauces are surprisingly very good for being fast food.  -Love the cole slaw and the waffle fries!  -This is located in the Lowe's Shopping Center at the SW CORNER of Dysart & McDowell. CLOSED on SUNDAYS.,1
fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,Went here once and got food poisoning!!!!  Never again will I go to a chick fil a. Ended up in the hospital for 2 days with iv fluids bc I was so sick. Tasted good going down but not coming up. Customer service terrible!!!,0

fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,"As far as the food goes; this place is like any other Chick-fil-a.  I come here b'c the service is usually better than other fast food joints.  Today's occasion though; not so much.  I had just come from the doctor's office and wasn't \all there\"" so I was a little slow and stumbly getting my order together; I admit it.

fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,One of the best fastfood options around  This Chick-fil-A has friendly staff and are quick with their service.  Food is good and sit better than the other fastfood places around.

SaIX7eay0vV-FxGPqTk1yA,I've only been to Pollo Loco a couple of times but I'm definitely a fan. Today I ordered the Chicken Avocado Taco Combo. This includes two soft chicken tacos along with chips and a soda for $6.99 plus tax.  I really enjoyed the tacos which came with lettuce and a slice of avocado and a sauce that made everything come together. I thought the pricing was fair and the A/C was definitely cranked up a skoosh too much today. I'm going to make this a go to destination when the outside temps are in the 110 degree range.,0
SaIX7eay0vV-FxGPqTk1yA,My husband and I LOVE El Pollo. The chicken is so tasty; the Pollo Bowls are so good and the service is excellent! We have been dining here at least once a week for years now.,1
SaIX7eay0vV-FxGPqTk1yA,"There is nothing like walking into El Pollo Loco and actually seeing the chickens grilling in back.  The smell hits you as soon as you walk in the place.  I guess it makes me feel good to see \fast food\"" actually taking its time cooking. I love the chicken bowls.  I always substitute the pinto beans for the BBQ black beans.  YUMMY! And; if you so desire; you can order tortillas on the side and they give you a choice of corn or flour.  Both are really good!  Chewy; stretchy and don't fall apart when you use them to eat. The restaurants are always clean and well-kept.  I've been to a few different locations.""",0
SaIX7eay0vV-FxGPqTk1yA,If you've never eaten here; order the chicken with sides or the original pollo bowl. They also have a dollar menu. It's a good fastfood place to eat food that doesn't taste like fastfood. But go for the food; not the atmosphere. The restaurant is old but clean. My husband has to eat here at least once a week; it's his favorite.,0
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,This place sucks always get order wrong and dont want to fix it also got mold on tortilla  and they said it was ok,0
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,It's Mexican fast food -- but it's really good Mexican fast food. My wife and I split a fish taco plate and an order of Carne Asada fries. They were a bit too generous with the tartar sauce on the tacos but I suspect most people would prefer it that way. Carne Asada was great.  The restaurant just opened at the northwest corner of Baseline and 35th Ave. It's a clean and inviting place. The workers seemed friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  UPDATE: Returned for Taco Tuesday (3/8/11). Burrito for $2 was huge -- and flavorful -- taco truck quality (a positive thing from my perspective as one who grew up in California eating Mexican food sold from trucks -- the best stuff!). The after-burn on my tongue from the green-pepper burrito lasted 45 minutes. Chicken taco was bigger than street size and tasted great.,1
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,"The reason I'm giving them a 1 is because  I can't give them a zero. The food is good but the service is the absolute worst of any business I've ever gone to.

KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Horrible service and the most incompetent employees I've ever dealt with. I made the mistake of going there today. This is after months of not going there because of the last time they fucked up my order. This morning I went in there to get a taco salad. The bill came to $7.57. I gave him $23.11 because the taco salad was supposed to be $8.11. The cashier told me it was $7.57 so I just handed him the $23. He gave me my change and the receipt. He handed me $.43. I told him that I gave him $23.. He continued to argue with me saying that I gave him $8. I called the police and then I called the corporate office. The corporate office called me back 20 minutes later and said the cash register was balanced. The manager took the $15 and pocketed it to cover him and his employee. When everything was said and done not only did I not get any of my change or any of my money back; I didn't even get the taco salad. I would never go there again. I urged each and everyone of you to stay away from there. When they make mistakes; they refuse to make them right. This isn't the first time that this has happened here either. Please stay away from here if you value your money.,0

KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,I had been waiting for this convenient place to open; but it took me a little while afterward to get around to eating here; & I wish I had read the reviews first.  Anyhow; here's how it went for me here today at a little after 11 AM:  Good:  I found this new place to be clean & comfortable inside; with both booths & tables.  This was my first visit to a Federico's; & you order at the counter; & then they call you to pick up.  I ordered a #12 Two Chiles Rellenos plate.  It comes with tortillas; & I asked for corn; & also a shredded beef hard taco to go along with it; since I was pretty hungry & wanted to be sure it was enough food.  Not so good:  Back at the table; I noticed that my ticket had the #17 Chile Verde plate on it; with corn tortillas; rather than Chiles Rellenos; with corn tortillas.  I went back up to the counter & the girl said she would fix it.  Not so good:  It was a  rather long time later; when my number was called; even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  A person who worked nearby with a half-hour lunch break would never have been able to eat the food before they had to leave.  Good:  My plate came out piled high with food; & looked really attractive.  The Chiles had a big dollop of guacamole & also sour cream on top; & there was a little salad plus generous servings of refried beans & Spanish Rice.  Not so good:  I started with bites of beans; rice; & a piece off the end of one of the chiles.  My plate food was all just barely warm...  almost room temperature!     :-O  Not so good:  I unwrapped my tortilla package; & the tortilla was hot; but it was FLOUR!  I ordered corn; & that was printed IN RED on their copy of my receipt!  Not so good:  They used Anaheim Chiles for the Rellenos; & by the time they're breaded & covered with sauce & the two toppings; you can barely taste the chiles.  They were too mild for this recipe; & if they want to use long skinny chiles; they should have been Nu Mex Big Jims like the other restaurants around the Valley give you.  (Otherwise; use a big Pablano; & only serve one.)  The only thing that saved this place from one Star was that the flavor of the beans & rice was good; & the portions of everything generous.  (I didn't need to have ordered the side taco.)  They DO really feed you here; but they need to tighten up the ship...  a lot!     :-O  #12 Chiles Rellenos Plate $6.59; Shredded Beef Hard Taco $2.09.,0
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Had lunch at this place...ordered a carnitas torts & the carnitas was dry and the torts kept falling apart. The horchata was good.,0
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Fast...food...fast!  I am sorry that others have had slow/bad service. Maybe that was then; but now; they are pretty fast.  Typically; I order for two or three folks in my orders and rarely have they been wrong and never have they been slow.  I've had their ceviche and guacamole fries (special order-no salt) several times and was very happy with speed; amount of fries & guacamole and spice-level of the guacamole. My son has had the carne asada fries; also no salt. As well; those orders were excellent; fresh and fast.  And is say that I've eaten here maybe 15 times now...usually forget to check in; but always  am pleased. That's why I continue to come...and will continue to do so!,1

KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Federico's is certainly good for a cheap Mexican place. I place it well above any of the 'bertos places I've tried. You get quite a bit of food for your money especially on Tuesdays; where some of the tacos and burritos are $1 or $2.  The Green Chili Burrito is my favorite item on the menu by far with the Carne Asada Fries following a close second. I wouldn't recommend getting the Green Chili burrito to go if you have more than a 4 or 5 minute drive home as the sauce will ultimately soak through and you'll be left with a fairly soggy (yet very tasty!) mess in your wrapper. Eat this quick for best results or be prepared to use a fork if you hit any red lights on the way home.  As Jon K. said below; the drive through is a nightmare. This is by far the most consistently slow drive through I've ever seen. If there are any other cars in the drive through; you should head inside and place your order.  This isn't meant to be an extremely fancy place. It's like a cleaner Filiberto's that smells a lot nicer and has much better food.,0
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Their El Rey burrito is so good! Carne asada; ham; bacon and guacamole is a perfect combination I would never have thought of. The chimichanga is pretty decent too. The service is always quick and friendly.,1
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,we go to this place often only because it's right around the corner from where we live and the price is okay and you get a helluv a lot food.  we have never tried the drive thru.  we always dine in.  we have ordered different taco; burrito combos and some bean & fries dish.  not the best food but above average for mexican fast food.  the service is okay and at times they mess up your order.  we never had any complications with fixing our orders.  just sitting and waiting to get our new orders.  if you are not in shape and love fried food this is the place.,0

KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,"I had been eating at Federico's for a while.  The food's pretty good; especially the red chicken tacos with that spicy green sauce.  They do sometimes mess up orders and take a while to get your food to you; not regularly though.  I don't really have a whole lot of complaints about the place... until now.  The service is usually good at Federico's; but not when I went there on the 12th.    After a long time away from the place; I went back to get some of those tacos.  I ordered and gave the clerk my card.  Unfortunately; the ticket printed up as declined.  She said; \Declined!\""; and smirked at me like it was hilarious.  I looked at my card to see if it was the right one and asked her to try it again.  Same thing.  \""Declined!\""  Big smirk.  I didn't get upset or anything.  I told her I was going to the bank and I left (I found out later that a gas station put a hold on my account that wasn't released until later that night).  I don't know if that happened to anyone else; but they need to train that lady to have a better attitude when it comes to customer service.  I'm sure she came off the same way to somebody else at some point.  All she had to do was tell me my card was declined instead of nearly laughing in my face like we were at a comedy club.  Like I said; I wasn't all that upset about it; but now I'm a little more than irked and won't be going back any time soon; especially considering there's a fairly new Filiberto's down the street that's much closer to me than Federico's.  If that's the way they let their staff treat customers; then they don't deserve my business.  Sorry guys; you blew it!""",0
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,"I had been eating at Federico's for a while.  The food's pretty good; especially the red chicken tacos with that spicy green sauce.

KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Well; I've gone back to Federico's several times since my last review and they seem to have improved.  Thank God that RUDE lady doesn't appear to be working there anymore; that's a plus!  Service is much better and even though the Monday-thru-Wednesday price of the tacos has gone up from $0.99 to $1.25; I still gotta have 'em; they're too good!  The flavor of their red sauce has changed for the better; and I like it more than the green sauce now.  If I could knock 'em on anything; I'd say that the restaurant needs to invest in a good salad spinner because the lettuce is way too freakin wet.  I like that fresh lettuce on my tacos; but I've had to start ordering it on the side or forgoing it altogether.  I'd prefer that they just make it right.  I absolutely can't stand opening my box to find my once-crispy tacos swimming in water and sauce; and after reading these comments about their refusal to admit their mistakes; I just might have to take another break from them if the situation doesn't improve.,0

KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,"If I could; I'd give this place no stars.  NASTY; NASTY; NASTY.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with ONLY potatoes; eggs and cheese.  Simple enough right? I got home and opened it up to find half cooked potates; wet eggs; and barely any cheese.  Oh and they added ham to my order along with tomatoes and scallions.  I tried a bite and it was DISGUSTING.  I promptly threw the food in the trash.  Oh; and the price??  RIP OFF.  I can go to almost any \berto's\"" and get the same thing; done correctly;  for just under 4 bucks... they charged me over 5.  I will NEVER eat hear again.  Don't waste your money guys..... Taco Bell has better food. :(""",0
KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Food is descent for the prices they started with. Now they overcharge. I recently ordered a carne asada burrito with beans and they charged me $7.14. My jaw dropped. They need to reevaluate their prices before they lose clientèle.,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,This place was a little confusing for me.  There were no descriptions of the food so I was flying blind when I ordered the California burger.  I just assumed it would have something like avocado or ranch or fish or sunshine or eddie money....but it didn't.  Nothing California about this burger other than that's probably where the lettuce came from.  Speaking of lettuce; this burger had it with some uncooked onions and a tomato.  These aren't normally things I want on my burger but; apparently; that's what constitutes a California burger.  It was more expensive than a regular burger because of the toppings.  Nice.  Since I failed to realize any of this at the time; I was still pretty hungry when I finished.  Since this is a steak-burger place; they like to flatten out the beef until it looks like the sole of your shoe.  It's pretty thin and not very filling.  The taste is good and it's not greasy (unlike Steakenburger) but I really wished I had ordered a double.    The fries were actually really good which made me really happy.  I ended up putting some on my burger just to try and give it some more substance.  Not bad.  Feels like I'm back in Pittsburgh.  Anyways; I probably wouldn't go back here but who knows?  It was better than Five Guys so they have that going for them.  It was a pretty ho-hum experience and that's probably what you'll get too.,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,I like the place. It reminds me of something you would see back in the midwest. That said; it is still fast food. The burgers are decent; but a little on the salty side. They have the very thin patties you don't tend to see much any more--which I like for a change of pace. Their shoestring fries are also very good.   Service is friendly; the place is clean and bright. No complaints; but nothing stands out as tremendous. Good for families with kids though.,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,"Great service. However the food was such a bad deal I will never go back. Way over priced and the \custard\"" is not custard at all. If u want real custard then go to Ritas. Don't go here if you are hungry. I just was very disappointed.""",1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,The burgers were great too bad that our orders were messed up. I also have to cut them a star because the Mountain Dew was out and they didn't have any to replace it with. I would gladly come back again I just hope my order is correct next time. They do give a military discount. I am giving an extra star because they're veteran friendly,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,The food was so delicious and everyone was so polite. As you place your order the cashiers are very welcoming and not one bit rude. Austin in particular was very helpful. He was busy and I asked for a lid; then minutes later he double checked that he did give me the lid just because he was so busy. He even waited for me to gather my things and stroller and opened the doors for me without me asking. The service here is outstanding. Thanks so much!!,1

X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Tasty moist flavorful burgers.   Wonderful thin crispy fries with minimal grease.   We've been back several times and will keep returning.  Prices reasonable.   Fast service; order takers know contents of menu items.  Appreciate this knowledge with having food allergies. Employee even cleared table of tray and baskets; nice touch.  Deserts look great; need to go just for desert; portions have been so good I don't get desert.  The only thing I would change is soda choice; personally prefer Coke to Pepsi.,1

X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Feel like kickin it ol' school?  Freddy's is the place to go!   Great burger and fry joint! The steak burgers are fresh patties made to order. They have a home cooked taste not the frozen fast food burger! Yes; they even have Veggie burgers too! You can get darn near anything you like on it ! The Fry's are fresh cut and seasoned or you can top them with cheese or chili.   I tried a little of everything and my favorite is the chili dog! Tastes like I remember growing up as a kid. The custard sundaes are amazing ! My favorite is the PBC&B mmmm good!  I like that they sell their seasonings so I can grill up the great taste at home!  Great family fun atmosphere.    http://spoonfulpersuasion.blogspot.com/,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Wow!  Great food and staffed by employees and managers who are on top of everything.  Employees are always cleaning and super friendly.  This is my favorite location and I would pass other places to eat here.  I ate there today and it was great!  Smiles and quick service with great tasting food.  A winning combination!!,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Excellent!  Customer service is great here and food was good as well;  especially the French fries!,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,I'm not sure what to think about Freddy's. I was super excited to try another Frozen Custard place (I heart Culver's) and this place is a hit or miss. The burger is alright but I keep giving it a chance hoping that it's a mistake on my part in the ordering process - I keep getting the California style. Keep in mind that ordering was the problem I had at In n Out until I found my groove.   The one thing I adore here are the fries. OH. EM. GEE. These little shoe string guys are the BEST. I think they sprinkle salt and pepper on them. I think I'll try them INSIDE my hamburger next time.,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,I have been an a burger kick lately; so a couple of my partners-in-crime and I went on a burger crawl...Freddy's was our first stop. All I can say is WOW! I had the Triple Steakburger; fries and drink combo ($6.89.) The burger is a smash burger...the meat is smashed on the grill in to thin patties which get all crunchy on the outside. I ordered the burger with cheese; mustard and pickle. It was delicious! The fries are the tiny shoestring fries like Steak & Shake fries. They were hot; fresh; and amazing! They also have diet Dr. Pepper which in my opinion is a big plus.    After devouring the burger and fries I ordered the Signature Turtle Sundae...vanilla custard; hot caramel; hot fudge; pecans; whipped cream; and a cherry. This sundae was absolutely amazing!!! The custard was dense and creamy and the toppings made me melt faster than the ice cream. Yummy stuff!  The employees were all friendly; cheerful; and efficient! The restaurant was very clean.  Thankfully for my waistline and circulatory system I live in a different state because If I lived nearby I would be eating here way to often.,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,SERIOUSLY??  Oh yelp how i rely on you to stand up next to what you are claimed to be by the ratings. when i see 4 stars that means it should be more than just okay! Why am i so let down with all of these places? When i saw the word steak burger i was expecting blow my mind out of this world phenomena! Not your average smashed burger wannabe. Don't get me wrong the flavor of the burger alone was decent but not worth $7 for a combo.  I LOVE french fries and these did NOT work for me. There was just a weird aftertaste. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was just weird.   As for the custard...  FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i had ordered a mini vanilla custard concrete with reeses peanut butter cups and i LOVE reeses peanut butter cups you literally have no idea. Next to the original two pack i also love the new mini cups you do not have to unwrap.  ANYWAYS back on track i get this concrete cup with a lid that is good for the car so it doesn't spill.  But the flavor was indeed rich and smooth but the flavor in general just lacked something to me. IDK what kind of peanut butter cups they used but they definitely were not reeses i can tell you that right now.  So dissapointed. If i were to try another concrete it will be strawberry cheesecake for sure. with extra sauce and what not to give it flavor.  But for now i am so mad at myself for spending $10 on BLAH food.,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Good choice for an afternoon snack; just had the frozen custard; it hit the spot; and was just what we needed to pick us up.  Prices were reasonable and no one came make a Sunday the wrong way; right?  Not crowded; clean; good service.  Looking at the food coming out; might have to come back and try a burger!,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Freddys has jumped into our weekly lunch rotation!!! I came here with a co-worker for the first time last week. Had the chili dog with fries. The dog was very good and their chili was amazing. Just the way I like it; no beans; but still chunky and the right amount of spice. I think I will definitely be getting a cup of chili the next time I come here. The fries were pretty good though very different. They were very very thin. I think these fries definitely live up to being shoestring potatoes. My co-worker has been looking for good Chicago dog but hasn't have much luck till now. Being from Chicago; she knows what a Chicago dog should be like. She said the one from Freddys was great! The only issue is that their dogs are a bit on the small side so I feel like I would have to order several to get full. I also gave Freddys four stars because I have not been able to try their namesake items (custard and steakburgers) to determine if they are really as good as it gets. Haha. But I will definitely be returning soon!,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,I finally tried their steak burger California style and it was very good. Tasted very fresh kinda like In and Out. I think I still might like In and Outs burgers better; however; Freddys still makes a mean chili dog! I can't quite give this place 5 stars though because I figured out last time that I really am not a fan of their fries. Everyone has their preferences of what fries should be and these are just not for me. Still have to try their custard. Service is great though and restaurant clean. Freddy's is still a winner in my book!,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Well after driving by many times and never stopping; we finally stopped today and it was crowded. We ordered a single steakburger and onion rings and a drink (Combo) and a chicago dog and a regular hot dog. Now off the bat this place kinda reminded me of Culver's with the Steakburger thing going on. I have to say it was tasty like Culver's; but we left still hungry; not many onion rings. The Chicago dog was great as I remember it from Chicago and my girlfriend enjoyed her hotdog and part of my hamburger (yeah; we were fighting over who is going to finish the last few bites; cause we were still hungry). We will try it again though as we always give places a few chances.,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Holy amazeballs. This place is so freakin delicious; it should be illegal. I generally get the patty melt and it is just perfect. The patties are thin; but they are so flavorful that it doesn't matter. The rye is perfect as well. I am super picky; and my order is always done just as I order it. The service is awesome; really; really friendly staff and quality food... This place is hard to beat.,1

X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Wow.  The steak burgers at this place are amazing!  When I finished my burger I almost went to order another one!  But I was saving room for their homemade custard which is also 5 stars!  Can't wait to go back to try more stuff!,0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,"I am writing about the location on Williamsfield Rd; Gilbert.  The food and prices are so- so.

X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Was just brought here for the first time by my in laws.  The food was awesome. As others have said it's not a traditional burger it's a thinner chip steak type party but great flavor.  The fry sauce is great as are the shoe string Frys.  They did mess up our order a bit but the manager fixed it right away and brought the order to our table apologized for the delay.   The Custard was awesome (brownie delight sundea)  great place I will be back with my family.  Great service is so hard to find!  But we found it here!!,1

X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,"I have a certain affinity for anything named \Freddy's;\"" my friends can tell you why; so when I first had the chance to go to Freddy's Burgers a couple years ago I was excited. I went on the recommendation of a friend; and it's still one of my favourite chain burger joints.   The burgers are made fresh to order; no heat lamps keeping your Big Mac warm here! The meat is so much better than your average fast food place. the buns are great and they always manage to get that awesome crispiness on the outside of the burger. My partner gets the patty melt; and keeps eating it even after she's unbuttoned her pants; mumbling; \""I'm so full... I really shouldn't eat any more.\"" I LOVE the shoestring fries. I've never had an issue with soggy; cool fries. They're always hot; fresh and salted just enough. The Chicago Dogs are pretty darn good too.   Get dessert! I'm a big fan of their frozen custard. My staple would be the turtle; with extra caramel. :)   The whole atmosphere is nice and very retro. Oldies on the radio; HUGE booths so you don't have to worry about where you're going to fit everyone and clean. Clean is a big deal to me. i HATE going to fast food places where the remnants of the last dozen customers are all over the tables and floor.""",0
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,I went here with a friend last week for the first time. The employees are very friendly and kind. I was impressed with all the choices of flavors for the frozen custard. My friend ate dinner and I had dessert. Very delicious custard and not too expensive either. I'll be back- the food and service were wonderful!,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Delicious food and always great service. I love the menu and the custard as well. Very helpful and friendly staff.,1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,I was craving chili cheese fries...and looked up Freddy's on Yelp; i saw their menu and some pictures of the chili fries and they looked amazing! I got there at 10:30pm on a friday. The employee who took my order was so nice and so helpful. I ordered the chili cheese fries and I also ordered a double steak burger California style and the original one. I got my food and it smelled amazing! The drive home was so long! Haha. I tried the chili cheese fries and errmahgerrddd! So so so delicious! Then i tried the burger and it has got to be one of the most delicious burgers ive ever had. It was so tasty; did not need anything else on it. It was amazing. I will definitely be back:),1
X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,This was my first and last visit. Fries were good but the burger was just ok. As far as the service; TERRIBLE. I ordered a cheeseburger; small fry and a diet dr pepper....I received a double hamburger; no cheese and they didnt give me my drink! I won't be back.,0

X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,My wife and I love to eat out at Freddy's. This is one of those places that I always take my out-of-town friends so they can try it. Freddy's  burgers are great; don't get me wrong they're still fast food burgers but they're as good as fast food comes. They're fries are unstoppable though; they're a thin cut fry with the perfect crisp outside and soft inside. They also use a great season salt on them. My wife loves their custards and there are a ton of options to choose from.  Lastly the staff is great! You know how sometimes you go to a fast food joint and now matter how much the staff smiles you can tell they hate their lives? At Freddy's you don't get that; the staff is always happy and helpful; I always get great service here.,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,This place is generally pretty good; however;  lately their employees are not very friendly. They are rush you; and always act like they are going out of their way to get your food. (News flash I think it is your job) You have to continue to repeat yourself; and they never tell you they are out of something before you order half your food. If I knew you were out of guacamole I wouldn't have ordered. Then they give you an attitude when you want to wait for them to make something they are out of. I am not sure if they are under new management. But this location has changed quite a bit; and not for the better.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,"As a Mexican food snob; it pains me to say this. It pains me to say that I love a corporate franchise that is owned by McDonald's; but I do; so there; and it's Chipotle.  Something about the brick of a burrito that I always get there is calming and makes significant steps towards soothing a weekend hangover. It isn't greasy at all and afterwards you don't walk away with the \I just ate too much Mexican food\"" stomach. They prep everything in house and the freshness comes out in everything I've ever ordered; all the way down the line to the chips they serve.   Even the music here is surprisingly good . . . If McDonald's weren't involved; it'd be hard not to give them five stars . . .""",0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,The salad at Chipotle is something that I crave often; and the salad dressing is amazing.  However; if you go to this location you will probably not get salad dressing-because they will be out and they do not want to take the time to make more.  Also; don't expect a lot of lettuce in your salad. At this location they are often either out of lettuce or getting so low they do not want to give you too much or they may have to go get more from the back.  This is the closest location to my house; so I went back tonight after staying away for a few months.  I ordered two salads and had to ask three times for more lettuce.  Then after my order was pushed down to the next person; they told me I had to wait while the filled all the other condiments in their area-there was no one behind me so I am not sure what the rush to fill all of those was about.  Then I get to the end to pay and ask for the salad dressing that they were supposed to give me at the beginning of the line.  They only had one salad dressing left.  I was told it would take a LONG time to make more; but they did not even offer to make it if I was willing to wait.  The cashier seemed incredulous that I only wanted to take one of the salads since there was only one salad dressing. Apparently I look like the type who is so healthy that I eat salad without dressing-not.  It isn't like there are any other options for dressing-they only have the one kind.  So I left with one salad for my daughter; and I went and gave another establishment my business.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,I used my android apparently and my food was ready before I was. The service was fast and friendly.,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,I am one of Chipotle's biggest customers and probably average about 2-3 visits per week.  I am usually impressed with their service and speed; but this particular Chipotle is the worst that I have ever been to and its unfortunately the closest to my house.  Their lines take forever; their employees are rude; they can never keep the food line stocked....I could go on and on.  I will drive out of my way just to not have to purchase from this store.  I have complained to Chipotle corporate about this store; however they seem to not yet have it figured out.  It needs new management.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,"This is the worst Chipotle location I've ever been to. They don't hold up to the standards set by Chipotle at all.    -People here move at a snail's pace. Im not saying they need to rush; but the way everything is set up should make for a smooth and quick experience.  - If you tell them what you want they can only remember one thing you said. Example: \Pico and hot salsa.\"" Then they just put Pico on and look at you. \""Sour cream; cheese; and lettuce.\"" Puts spur cream on and just looks at you.   - Ordered tacos to go; when I get home with them; 5 minutes later; I have a pile of sour cream all over my \""tacos\"" which now resemble a casserole of some sort. I can't even figure out where one taco begins or ends. So appetizing for $8.   If I wanted crap I would go to Taco Bell. At least there a taco still looks like a taco and they keep the contents inside the tortilla.""",0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,The service is friendly and fast! The food is fresh and perfectly seasoned and cooked! What's not to love? Busiest time is from 12-1 and 6-7,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,This location sucks. Didn't know you could desecrate chipotles perfection but you can. They run out of super basic things every time I'm there and just expect you to deal with it not even try to provide more or hustle. Last time I came in at a very normal dinner hour and they ran out of steak and the employee said to just order something else? Da fuq?   They run out of chips ON THE REG which I didn't know was possible. There will be 6 or more employees standing around doing nothing. Also the employees are pretty sassy 85 percent of the time (eye rolls etc). Like I get it; customer service is rough at times but chill out.,0

K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,I really like this Chipotle location over others. I ordered on-line for pick up and arrived early. The ordered wasn't ready (not their fault) and they offered me a complimentary drink while I wait. To me; thats over and above. The place was packed and they still had my order ready in about 5 minutes. I expected to wait at least 15 minutes.The cashier was very genuinely friendly and professional. I ordered the steak burro with black beans; rice; sour cream; corn salsa; and lettuce. It was so fresh and satisfying with just the right amount of spice. So; so; good. Glad to have you in the neighborhood Chipotle!,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,The food was good.  I had the salad with chicken; black beans and salsa.  Good service. I arrived before the the long line.   I would go back.,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,My husband and I are avid Chipotle fans... usually the service at most locations is good; sometimes great. THIS location on the other hand is TERRIBLE. I could write a book on the many occasions we have experienced atrocious customer service. I hope the owner of this location wises up and reads the reviews. A change in staff is necessary!! Food is still good; but if you're looking for good service.. Spend your money elsewhere.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,This location is not as stellar as others. They usually have a bit of a wait and the regular employees do not seem thrilled to be there. The food is fine but the customer service alone makes it a chore to stop by.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,I have been eating at this location for many years and the service is still good and food is rightly cooked.,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,Yesterday; not only did I receive the slowest service I've ever had at a Chipotle but one of the staff members; April; was extremely rude...she gets paid to take orders not the other way around,0

K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,"I'm only giving this three stars because I love Chipotle food. Delicious cilantro-lime rice and perfectly season steak keep me coming back. This review is solely based on the customer service of this location.   I work right down the street; so this is a very convenient lunch stop for me. The time to get my burrito isn't what bothers me. I know if I go there during lunch I'm going to have to wait in a line; that's no problem. What I hate is being rushed through the process of making my burrito. I only get three ingredients; so you think it would be hard to mess that up. They've ripped the tortilla before and expected me to be happy with them just wrapping another tortilla around it. One time the employee put sour cream on when I clearly didn't ask for it and asked if I would \just eat it?\"" Not to mention the inconsistency. Even if I get less ingredients then my boyfriend my burrito shouldn't be literally half the size of his. We're paying the same amount; so I want a size-able burrito! I've worked in food service before. I know lunch rushes suck; but when the quality starts slipping you need to take a deep breath and remember you're getting paid to make the burrito I'm paying almost eight dollars for. I shouldn't be able to tell that you hate your job.   It hasn't always been like this. There was some new employees hired a couple months ago; and I gave them a break. But it's been a few months and it's time to meet the standards that Chipotle has set for itself. I avoid this location like the plague.""",0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,"I am an avid Chiptole fan; but never have I had as terrible service as I did today at this location.   I used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch. My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot; ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online; she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then \went to the back\"" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay; after I had already told her I had paid for it online.   The person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it; that was actually the least of my concerns; that happens; I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location; there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving; mind you; there was no line; which is rare for any Chiptole; so it really made no sense that our service was this poor.   We asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07.   So an order I placed at 2:20; was supposed to be ready at 2:45; and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online.   I will not be going to that Chiptole ever again. And will defintely think twice before ordering online with you guys; very disappointing. :(""",0

K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,As soon as I walked into this chipotle I was greeted by a line that was almost out of the door. The staff was working very hard to take orders and cook the food and the line went much faster than I thought it would; no complaints there.   The issue tonight was a matter of health. Simply put; the steak in my burrito bowl was  grossly undercooked. So undercooked that the meat was actually cold. I get it; it's busy so the food is being rushed but there is no excuse for this egregious error.   Usually this type of transgression would get an automatic one star as my health was potentially compromised but I bumped them a star because the staff quickly made me another bowl and because they did such a good job handling the large crowd.  This better be an isolated occurrence because next time I'll have to report them to the state,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,Just moved back to this area and as a regular at Chipotle I may just quit going to any Chipotle after coming to this location. I gave it 4 tries; the rice is always dry; the portions served are tiny; the employee attitudes are the WORST and it's the slowest service I've ever seen. All 4 times. Horrible.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,What a disappoinment. I eat chipotle at least 5 days out of the week. Its healthy and delicious. I live in Old town Scottsdale so the location on Scottsdale road is where i always go. But; tonight i happened to be coming back from a friends house closer to this one. Since it was on the way i decided to stop here instead of waiting to be closer to home. MISTAKE. The woman who kept bouncing between the cashier and the food line was rude (btw; clearly the cashier girl didnt know what she was doing..but we'll get to that later). I asked her for a vegetarian salad with the rice on the side...she put it in a portion cup and i told her i was sorry and i prefer it to be placed in a bowl instead  ( i hate the rice all smashed) she proceeded to tell me it was an extra charge. (So to have my rice on the side costs more?! I told her the chipotle by my home never charged me and she said theres nothing she can do. Wow; great customer service. Then i ordered chips and salsa and was charged again for an extra.salsa. it took  while for the cashier girl to even get my order rung up correctly. For someone who eats chipotle sooo much;  you will NEVER see me again at this location. Rude.rude.rude.,0

K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,My wife and I; who are vegetarians; ordered a couple tofu burritos and we each found a chuck of meat in ours.  Additionally; the staff misplaced our take-out ticket so it wasn't ready when we arrived and once it was made; they forgot an ingredient.  I would give this place one-star; but when we called the manager; he was very kind and offered a free meal.  Because of him; I'll give it another try; and I may potentially update this review.,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,First time at this Chipotle. After reading so many Yelp reviews about the long line; I decided to order ahead online. Thank you Yelpers; great advice.   Parking was tricky. Had to park at the bank but not a long walk. As I walked in; I bumped into the back of the line. There were seriously about 30-35 in line. I was afraid; after reading a couple of reviews; that my order wouldn't be ready but; lo; there it was; all bagged up.  I ordered a barbacoa bowl with guacamole and extra cheese. My coworker had ordered a chicken bowl and a side of chips. It worked to about $9 each. Sounds steep but the portions are big. Really big.  My bowl was full of meat; guacamole and cheese even though I asked for no lettuce. The meat was hot; juicy; seasoned well and held good flavor.   I recommend this location to anyone BUT; order ahead. They opened at 11; I got there at 11:15 and it was packed!,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,It's Chipotle.... it's like nearly every other Chipotle. Fast; efficient service even if there is a line.   I like getting the Carnitas bowl. Yummm..   This location has a nice outdoor patio; which is perfect for enjoying a margarita after work.   Staff has always been friendly; and the restaurant has always looked pretty clean.,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,It's a Chipotle.  That means its consistent; you know what you're getting; and it's always fast.  If you haven't been to one before and you like fresh Mexican-style food; you have to try it.  Choose your ingredients so you get exactly what you want.  This location is surrounded by a lot of office buildings so it will be very packed every weekday during the lunch rush.  Show up by 11:45 and you'll be fine; but just after noon there will be a line out the door.  Still; it only takes about ten minutes to get through.  Or order using their iPhone app and you can walk to the front of the line; grab your stuff; and go.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,"\brick of a burrito\"" - that says it all.   When I first had Chipotle it was in Dallas; TX before The Pixies show. As you can imagine; the food was great; and I was thrilled at the concept of build-your-own-burrito. With that said; I don't like Chipotle. Or; perhaps; saying I'm not fond of it is more accurate. Who am I kidding; I can take it or leave it.   This location is a royal pain. Don't go - whatever you do - during lunch time during the week. That's just asking for trouble. Sure; you can call your order in ahead of time; but you still have to wait in line to pay for it and get it bagged to go. Not worth it.   Last time I ate 1/2 my brick burrito; it made my tummy hurt after wards for the rest of the day. Needless to say; I haven't been back.""",0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,This loc is so quick and efficient with pickup. Love the convenience of online-ordering. Veggie fajita bowl rocks...and just found out they'll use unsalted rice on request!,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,Two stars because the food is still good; but anyways I have been to this chipotle many times and it's a 50-50 thing but their customer service is the worst out of any chipotle I've been to in phoenix. I honestly waited 10 minutes from the time the lady started my burrito to the time I checked out. Total b.s. Then the lady who was on the register proceeded to charge me 9.75 for a chicken burrito where most chipotles only charge 7.00 for the same thing and she didn't even apologize or even look at me for making me and 10 other people wait for 10 minutes to be helped. Oh yeah; they were making food for themselves too and putting it in front of the customers food. Great job on employee training. Total joke.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,Love Chipotle so much; just NOT this location. Upon moving to this side of town from Tempe I realized that the service and taste was not the same as the Chipotle on Mill and the one at Tempe Market place.  First off the employees here were far less motivated and educated in the product as the students at ASU -_- Sadly I came in an hour before they closed; and to save time and effort they weren't cooking anymore meat.  I only asked for a steak burrito and received a crap-load of rice and beans and two lonely and terrified pieces of steak.  After chuckling  I asked for just a little more. I was told that I was given 4 ounces and that was all I could get without being charged. Sadly I ended up with a huge ass bean and rice burrito and jumped for joy when I reached those two steak chunks.  Each Chipotle has its taste..this location is not for me. If you usually go to this one and you like it...take a much needed trip to the chipotle on mill ave and you will be enlightened on how Chipotle on this side of town should taste!,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,I enjoy coming to this location because it is never super busy and the customer service is great. The staff is very friendly and the food is terrific  Since the temperatures are semi-dropping; I do like that they have an outdoor patio because it's great to enjoy the evening weather... The bathrooms are always clean,1
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,This place is a joke. The employees are slow as can be; they f*ck the portions up; they look at you like you're an idiot when you are ordering. I wouldn't give this place another shot unless someone else was paying for it. I feel this place should be shut down and a Filibertos or something of that nature should open up in its place. Hell I will just go to the Taco Bell that's in the same parking lot.   The one star is because they had air conditioning.  Manager should be fired.,0
K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,"to be fair... I love the food...it was the service. Well; it was fast; but the girl was rude and kept rushing me ( THERE was nobody behind me) My hubby and I were ordering take out. I knew what my daughter and her boyfriend wanted and I was trying to place their order. \Miss Rude\"" evidently didn't want to take the order separately- she wanted to take  4 orders ALL AT ONCE and shovel the food in as quickly and as messy as she possible could. When I told her I wasn;t ready to order - that I wanted to look at the menu - she gave me an attitude; and said she wanted to do them all together. My hubby steps up and makes his order she rolls her eyes at me and after  the third time I told her I was still deciding she gave me more attitude. To be fair; I can see her being impatient IF there was a line behind me. There was not. And ----- the  other three orders together  took all of 45 seconds- yes that fast) About his time I had it with her bitchiness and said  (politely) that she's wasting time waiting on me when she can finish the other three orders ( more attitude from  worker with big spoon). The food was 'slopped' in the the  to go bowls. She needs; in my opinion; a refresher course in how to deal with customers. I was not rude; I could've been; but she was rude enough for both. I was hoping there was an email address to this particular Chipotle's here(on Yelp)  to send to the manager but I don;t see one. Chipotle is a great place to eat.. they just need to remember that whom they hire in the front line represents their company. They don't need and shouldn't ever have someone so rude up front.""",0

Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,I have driven by Eegee's a bunch of times running here and there but never thought to stop since Casa Grande has way too many fast food places. However today (4/15/2012) I decided to try them.  Even in the drive thru; service is good. I usually like my sandwiches plain but I took a chance and got a small ham & cheese grinder. It was freakin awesome!!    The Orange Dream to go with it? Very nice.   Overall a nice small lunch for $5 that left me really satisfied.,1
Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,Awesome service and great food. Always stop on my way through Casa Grande. Get the ranch fries!,1
Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,Every time I drive to Casa Grande for work; I get multiple requests from family to bring them back some Eegee's -- We LOVE us some Eegee's!  The standard shaved iced flavors are awesome; but they throw in a new flavor each month to try and it's often seasonal and tasty.  I always thought they were just a shaved iced shop; but then decided to try a turkey sub and fries one day; and I was not disappointed!  Not only do they get it right with the food/drink; they have the PEOPLE part of business down too!  Every time I walk in; I feel welcomed by the energy of the people that work there.  It's strange to say this; but even better than the way the customers are treated is the way the employees seem to be treated.  There are always managers working right at the counter with the other employees; and they are always kind; and encouraging to the employees.  They also give discounts to all service men/women; every day; no questions asked.  I love seeing good employers in action.  Best shaved iced around (wish they weren't so far away!); and love what they do in their community!,1
Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,"I guess I'll be the lone detractor of this overpriced dump. I travel through Casa Grande a couple of times a month; saw them building this place and then decided to try it - having no clue what kind of food they serve.  Well; it's  just another sub sandwich shop and a pathetic one at that.    You don't get to request whatever you want on your subs here; they give you whatever they are going to put on it; including slathering it with enough mayonnaise to make 5 sandwiches with and there is no option to have your sub toasted.  I ordered a Turkey sub and a medium - eegee I guess they call that drink  of which there are only 3 flavors available (from what I can see; it's a glorified shaved ice drink).  The manager was at the register and asked what kind of cheese I wanted on it.  I told him cheddar; not knowing and him not informing me that for a 12 inch sub; they are going to add another $1.05 to the price for cheese!  The cheese; btw; was gross.  Like that imitation stuff you get at a grocery store that comes in slices; nasty.    I got the sub and the drink - we're talking a 12 inch sub and a medium drink - and the bill was $11.10!! That's just plain outrageous! You don't even get a bag of chips with it for that much money; chips are extra!  The sub was perfectly bland; just another Jimmie Johns style sub excepting not as good as that (and I don't like Jimmie Johns).  After eating this thing and the drinking the drink; my stomach started getting upset.  After 15 minutes; I ended up having to pull the semi over on the side of the highway as I started feeling like I was going to throw up.  I think it was the gross amount of mayonnaise coupled with that nasty cheese that got me close to upchucking; but I'm not sure.  I had to sit there for 20 minutes before the feeling finally subsided and I could start driving again.    There was absolutely NOTHING special about this place OR it's food.  If you really want a sub and are in Casa Grande; Subway is just down the road; is 50 times better tasting and is MUCH cheaper.  Adding: the prevailing statement that this place is \cheap\"" is ridiculous.  If you just buy a sub and nothing else; then I guess it's cheap; but don't add the cheese!  If you want a meal; then you add the drink and the chips or fries and now you are in the \""moderate\"" range; of which this place is hardly worthy of the prices it's asking to sit down and have a meal. A 12 inch sub - Turkey is what I had - is $6.89; NOT including cheese; which for a foot long is $1.05 more.  Since everywhere else does NOT add for cheese; the price of that sub is actually $7.94.  This is a plain-Jane sub; nothing fancy at all.  Then add a medium drink; of which I had; which is if you get the eegee's; is $2.29; a medium soda is $1.89.  Note; there were no combos listed on the menu at all.  A small fries is $1.99; a  bag of chips is $1.29.  So; if you get their infamous \""eegee's\"" drink in medium size; a 12 inch sub and a bag of chips; you are at $13.22 for a meal without tax!  This is completely outrageous!!  You'll pay $5 less for a FAR superior sub combo at Subway.  That is the sticking point: This place does NOT have combo prices!  Referencing the review that says \""these people are clueless\""; referring to the Yelps! that are giving Eegee's a poor review; and since mine is the only poor review; let me just say this: it is obvious that most if not all of these other reviews are from people who grew up going to Eegee's.  This chain obviously has a sentimental value to them.  Mine is a  subjective review with no bias since I had never eaten before at this establishment and this was my first (and last) time ever eating there.  The food I ate there was bland; almost tasteless.  The price for a meal; since there are no combos listed on the menu; are outrageous for the food being served.  This is the plain facts.  The price tag definitely is NOT worth it for the food that is being served.  Additional edit: per the reviewer that thinks Subway is inferior to this place; please give me a break.  Subway is FAR superior to this place; in fact; just about any of the sub shops are way better.  Some of Subway's meats are of the \""processed\"" flavor but not all of them and I can stand there; watching them make the sandwich and tell them how much of this and that I want on it; which you definitely cannot do at Eegee's.  The Eegee's sub I had was the worst sub I have ever tasted; period.  I did like the Eegee's shaved ice drink; I'll give them kudos for that; it was good.""",0
Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,"About 2 miles off the highway; but worth the stop. $3 for a 5\ turkey grinder (all the toppings) and $1.80 for an eegee (frozen drink.) The tables were clean and the service was fast.""",1

Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,Never been to an egees before and I was craving a hotdog from one of those stands usually outside a lowes; but this lowes didn't have one! So I went to egees which surprising Nathan's hotdogs were on their menu! The staff were friendly and greeted me right away when I walked in. While looking at the menu; the pastrami sandwich caught my eye so I thought I would try it out. I ordered a side salad too with Italian dressing. I love that this is a healthy option that's available. The salad was good. The sandwich wasn't memorable. I could imagine getting it again only because I forgot I already had it! Lol.   One more thing. I think the rag they use to clean the tables smell kind of funky. But I am not positive of that statement. I was also sitting across the trash. It was a localized whiff but wasn't the entire restaurant. Lol. I will update on that in my next visit.,1
Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,We drove out to Casa Grande a few weekends ago 1) because we had nothing better to do and 2) because I wanted to try me some eegee's. I saw on the website that the eegee flavor of the month was watermelon and I wanted to hit this place up before it was gone. It's a bit of a trek for us; 45 minute drive.   We got in around 3pm; not exactly lunch but not exactly dinner either so it was pretty empty. I ordered the 8 inch veggie grinder with no cheese on wheat. +1 for any place that offers wheat bread. I know most places do these days; but its always nice to have that as an option. My husband ordered the 12 inch original grinder on wheat. We also ordered a large fries to share and we each got small watermelon eegee's.   The eegee's were good. I remember coming here many years ago and not liking the eegee's; but I also think it depends on what flavor you get. The regular flavors I have no interest in; but the watermelon was a nice break from the ordinary. I do think that it was too much for me. I only ended up finishing half; so my husband ended up drinking the rest for me. I could do with a 8oz size.   The sandwiches I think were just ok. Not fantastic but they were good. The bread was nice and soft and there was a good amount of veggies. However; the girl explained that there was carrots on the veggie but I didn't find any. I did find a ton of black olives which I picked off cause I dislike them. But the dressing was good on the sandwich.   The fries were the best part. So skinny and crispy. Exactly how I love my fries. And I know ranch dressing is a disgusting concoction; but the ranch here is so good. Its like crack. I kept eating all the fries hoping my husband wouldn't notice how many I had had and he didn't exactly get his fair share. Next time I will have to get my own fries.   I hope they open an eegee's someday in the Phoenix area; but for now I am willing to drive here once in awhile if the craving strikes.,0
Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,I like eegees; the food is ok not the best but that isn't why we go there for. They are know for their frozen drinks called eegees which are awesome and even more awesome in the summer time. Service is usually fast and friendly.,1
Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,Great service! Great prices!!We love it!,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,There always seems to be a line here; but it moves fairly quickly. They are definitely not afraid to pile on the toppings for you; and will gladly let you add additional salsa (I personally like to add pico de gallo and corn to mine); or fajita veggies. The barbacoa burrito I ordered was a behemoth of a meal; approximately the size of 3 regular looking burritos due to amount of fillings they put in. I'm surprised they could actually wrap the burrito from end to end because it was so large!  Fountain sodas are Coke-based; and there is ample seating.,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,I ate at this new Chipotle the Friday afternoon of January 8th.  When I left there was a line out the door all the way to the end of the strip shopping center.  There had to be at least 50 or 60 folks in line at 3:00 in the afternoon!    Well It turns out I started eating a little too early.  At 3:00pm Chipotle's was giving out free T-Shirts and a free burrito!  I missed out!    There are some good reasons to wait a while to eat at this Chipotle.  Mostly it is staff training.  I eat at Chipotle quite a bit.  This one was something of a disappointment.  I ordered a Carnitas Fajita for a change.  They were out of the Fajita veggies; then they were out of the delicious Carnitas.  When the food finally arrived they assembled the burrito and by the time I got to the table it was soggy and fell apart even though I was using the peel the foil method of eating the burrito.    I have high hopes for this place and hope that by the time you read this the service and quality issues will be addressed.  It is a nice restaurant with plenty of seating inside and a nice patio.  Of course the place was clean because it is brand new and shiny!    Now that I think about it the folks lined up will be good practice for when they get busy.  The free T-shirt and burrito will soften the blow if there are any mistakes on the orders.  I will certainly stop by and give it another try.,0

xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,I routinely pass by this location to dine at Smashburger next door.  The service at this location is not up to par.  Their managers may listen to you but do not correct their staff's behavior.  I'd recommend going to neighboring businesses before giving your time and money to this Chipotle.,0
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,I went for my first time today and ordered a barbacoa burrito. It made me sick.  Cons Cold tortilla Cold and Flavorless barbacoa Beans tasted like plastic bottle caps Salsa had a weird taste    Pros The little red tray where they put your burrito on The guacamole   I know it's fast food but I just don't find what's so exciting about this place. There are better places here in the valley that serve delicious Mexican food for the same price.,0
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,Yum yum; super accommodating service even if we don't know what to do; yay for fast service even when it's packed..,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,I order take out from this location on a weekly basis; and I'm always so impressed with the friendly staff; the amazing fresh food; the super delicious chips and guacamole; and the prices! Great healthy food to go; you can't beat Chipotle! Keep up the great work guys!! See you this week.,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,"Literally the best \fast food\"" restaurant I've ever be too. Not just because of the food but the service is outstanding! I've been a regular here for months and never have I come in to someone with a bad attitude. If anyone has complaints about this place it's because they are the type of person to find the littlest flaw in perfection. I literally made this yelp account specifically to write this review. I've worked in fast food and this teams hard work should not go unrecognized. I'll be back next week.""",1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,I love chipotle bowls.  Healthy; fresh and convenient. I like grabbing lunch or dinner here when a hurry.  Great customer service.  Their tacos are excellent too!,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,Be patient. Long line; slow service.,0
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,"Love ... Love ... Love Chipotle!   This location is always consistent and have never messed up an order; even a phone in. The food is fresh; flavorful; and reasonably priced for the portions you get. You definitely want to come hungry! I always say; \I'll take some home.\"" It never happens!  My only negative has to do with parking. If you come at lunch or dinner the parking can be a bit of a pain; but I can't blame Chipotle for that one! That just means it's good food :-)  One of the staff members was great the other day... I didn't catch his name but he came around and asked us how the food was. Once he saw me eating the Guac he stopped back by to ask me if I had any pointers to make it better? Good guy and cares about the product he puts out for the customers.   I'll definitely be back!""",1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,Definitely disappointed this time. Normally a visit to a Chipotle is where the staff is attentive and the food is ample. This was not the case this time. The scoops were lacking their normal robust amount and left me hoping it was enough for my family. I had to repeat my order more than once while the person making my food was distracted by the people who walked in behind me. Kind of a bummer this time.,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,The service is always fast and friendly. Large dining are both inside and out. The food is always fresh and tasty and plenty of it. I've never had a bad experience.,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,Oh my good friend; it was love at first bite. I first tried Chipotle in Ohio in 2002. Oh man; was I hooked. I have no idea how this is possible; but back then I could actually get down two burritos. Wow. For those of you who have eaten here but have never experienced the Chipotle Carnitas; please help yourself by doing so. This is the best carnitas I have ever tasted and it is always amazing. Moist with a hint of salt and seasonings. I have turned many people on to their carnitas. Their cilantro lime rice is sooooo tasty! I always ask for extra. I no longer eat meat and this is actually one of the few meals I will truly miss even though I didn't eat here all the time. Their pinto beans are cooked with bacon so I have to get black beans and their vegetarian burrito now...it's good...but that meat is always on the other side of that glass looking awfully good. My order: Vegetarian burrito; extra rice; black beans; peppers and onions; pico; the corn salsa; the medium salsa; sour cream; cheese; lettuce; and guac (or instead of guac the carnitas). Their chips are super yummy too...try them with guac! OMG Flavor Explosion!,0
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,This is the best Chipotle in the Tempe area. Fast; friendly service. Very clean establishment. Fresh; delicious food. They would rather have me wait a minute for the freshest; just-off-the-grill food then scrape the bottom of a tray. If you get Rachel as a server; you get great conversation with your speedy service. It's a fun experience.,1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,This only gets 4 stars because I love the food.  Went there to get a bowl to-go for lunch today.  There was an extremely long line that wrapped around back toward the cashier.  The line moved fairly quickly; so I didn't mind.  In front of me was a tall; bigger guy who ordered a bowl with chicken.  Then I ordered my bowl with chicken.  Here's the part I don't get--I understand that you're super busy & all; but how come the big guy; who looks like he could eat less; get a bigger scoop of chicken than me; this little Asian girl who looks like she could use some more food?  Shouldn't the restaurant serve equal portions?  Where's the consistency?  And efficiency!  Just think--if a customer orders double meat; but the server scoops two big scoops that amounts to like three regular scoops or more; that is one less customer they can serve.  And then they skimp on the guacamole scoops.  If I'm going to pay an extra $1.80 for just a scoop of guacamole; I deserve a full scoop!,0
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,"This Chipotle is quickly becoming a regular lunch spot for me. The lines are long; but the people working there are fast; efficient and friendly. Even if there are 30 people in line ahead of you (and there often are); you're typically ordering within 5-10 minutes. Steve Ells would be so proud of this location.   I love the chicken tacos. Their grilled chicken is bomb; and the tortillas are tasty. Three chicken tacos with cheese; lettuce and hot salsa is my jam. The food is good; and it just feels fresher and better for you than any other fast food option. They also offer Coke Zero; which is good since I'm trying to give up non-diet soda (New Year's resolution...trying to \get healthier\"" and \""drop pounds\"" so I don't have a \""weight problem\""...Sorry; just had to channel my inner Chris Farley for a minute).  Anyway...Rather than getting crappy fast food for lunch; or paying way too much for crappy food at a chain restaurant in Tempe; I'll hit up Chipotle a couple times a week and at least feel OK about my lunch choices.""",1
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,Everyone should know Chipotle by now. Nothing super fancy but sure hits the spot sometimes. It's a lot easier to special order burritos and quesadillas and have them made in two minutes than it is to do it at home and clean up the mess. Of course they along with all other similar quick fix burrito shops cram gobs of beans and rice and cilantro into everything so I usually state specifically little or no rice and beans double the meat and pay for it. But it tastes better.,0
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,Last three times I have been in the restaurant it has been after 830pm and they are still quite busy.  Tonight; when i was in line; there were 6 people in front of me; 2 who had already ordered.  It seriously took 15 minutes before my order was taken and another 6-7 minutes to complete.  The cashier was off in her own world; all the food was empty and getting refilled; and generally a poorly run night.  Food was ok; nothing to talk about.  But the guac I ordered with my chips was runny and really bad.  You are a quick stop for ok mexican food.  Your late night crew at this restaurant needs to be retaught how to work fast and make people happy.  they clearly need help.    I will probably give them one last chance; but am not looking for much improvement.  This store needs help as Most chipotle stores are 10 times better.,0
xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,The 4 stars is in comparison to other Chipotle's I've been to; especially in this area.  I have to admit; when they were building this plaza; my friends and I tried to guess every day what it was going to be. We had it narrowed down to a Chipotle or a sushi joint (both would kill me for sure) and I cannot believe we were actually right.   I am pretty pleased with this place. Both times I've stopped by it's been clean and pretty speedy service. Every time I come in; I am surprised by all the extra room around to the side and out on the patio and it makes me happy.  I'm sure anyone reading this has been to Chipotle; but if not; or if you're feeling like trying something new.. my signature dish for the past few years has been carnitas bowl with black beans; corn; fajita; lettuce and a little bit of the dairy stuff. Wash it down with a Nantucket nectar apple juice and you're golden.,1
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,ive had friends in florida RAVE about 5 guys. i never drove out to the locations when they opened in the east valley but when this one opened i figured sure ill try it.  first time i went..not so good so i held off making judgments because so many people raved about it.  so i tried again. i ordered online...said my order would be ready in 15min. i arrived to pick up my order just over 15 min later and proceded to watch people order at the counter and get their food before myself.  seemed strange; what was the point to order online?  after waiting at the pick up counter for 10min they said you have the online order right...yes... then they bag up my burgers and put them up on the couter where they sit for another 10min until the fries are done.  I LOVE GREASY BAD FOR YOU FOOD.  but i couldnt even eat the fries.  they were soaked in grease.  which one would say greasy fries = good but not these. i think they did not blanch the fries before deep frying them.  the burger i will not rate beacause by the time they sat for over 20 min then the 5 min ride home they bread turned into a mush around the meat.  i did eat a burger in the place the first time and...needless to say there are several better options in the valley. even in-n-out burger is much much better.,0
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,This newest Five Guys opened up the street from my house about three months ago & I finally got around to giving it a try tonight.  I ordered their regular burger with raw onion; pickle; tomato; ketchup; mustard; green peppers; Jalepeño peppers & mushrooms.  My order was ready in a short little while; served up by the very friendly staff in a bright; clean; comfortable atmosphere; with cool oldies playing & free peanuts on the side.  YUM; YUM; YUM!!  IT WAS AN EASY 5 STARS FOR THIS BIG; AWESOME BURGER priced at $5.59.     :-)),1
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,So my son and I decided we hadn't been to Five Guys in a long while - like over a year.  Went there tonight around 720pm and there were equal numbers of employees to customers - about 5 each.    Two burgers; one a double cheeseburger the other one a regular cheeseburger and one big order of fries.  Dropped $25 bucks.  Only one person ahead of us but took about 4-5 minutes for their order (for 2 people).  Even though the place was not busy - the employees seemed more interested interacting with each other than customers.  Got done ordering and was waiting.  Young lady came back into the place 2x's working to get her order correct...made my spidey sense go off.  We got our order to go and headed out  - didn't want to deconstruct and reconstruct the contents of the bag..  Got home and both burgers were doubles; and one of them didn't have onions (contrary to the order).    Mediocre at best but for a Scottsdale level price.   Oh well; I think the next period that we go dark for Five Guys will be much longer than the last.  Habit is very good alternative.,0
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,Really good food. Outstanding customer service. I would much rather spend a few extra bucks for good food and awesome customer service. Every time I come here everyone is always friendly and prompt with service. I would recommend to anyone.,1
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,I'll take a side of burger with my order of grease...  I want all you yelpers out there to know that before I have a heart attack from eating at Five Guys that it's been fun; I had some great reviews; I don't think I'm gonna make it and I love you all... goodbye.,0
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,love the Cajun fries here (a small order is enough for two people; trust me) and that you can put SO MANY toppings on your burger!  it's a little pricier than other fast food joints; but I feel like they use better quality ingredients so I don't mind paying a few more bucks.,0
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,"This is your average hamburger joint. Originally based on the east coast and making the expansion in the west. The food is very fresh and never frozen. I love that each day they put where the potatoes came from. It's a nice touch. Service is always friendly and for a quick lunch I like to order online before I get there.  The burgers are good and it's always fun to design it exactly how I want it on that given day. Be warned; the \little\"" burgers are single patty and regular burger is a double. An order of regular sized fries easily feeds two; possibly three people. And the Cajun spice is the way to go there.  The biggest con with the joint is the parking. It's awful on a good day. Be prepared to do some circles or park in the nearby neighborhood.""",1

XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,Great juicy burgers and amazing fries at a great value! Five Guys is the standard I set for any burger or fries I eat elsewhere. The staff is friendly and quick with your order. The place is clean; with lots of wooden tables for seating. There's also tables and umbrellas outside for additional seating. This store also has fancy Coke machines.   The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back for more!,1
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,We got everything we ordered correctly. The fries were super fresh and we have tons of leftovers of them. The little burger is still a big burger; so don't order too big! Staff was friendly and the place was clean.,1
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,We finally tried out Five Guys!   I liked how simple the menu was; though I was pretty sad to see that there weren't any milk shakes on the menu.   The amount of fries they give you is obscene! We got one regular and one Cajun style; and between 3 fry loving people still had a PILE left over.   The burgers are made to order with tons of great toppings to choose from. I do wish they would use a bit of a better quality bun; but that is my only real complaint.,0
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean; fast and predictable.,1
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,"Finally got to try this place out after thinking about it for a while. I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. This is probably one of the better fast food burgers I've had in a while. Yes; the buns were generic; but it was awesome to eat a non-greasy fast food burger that didn't sit like a 10lb gut bomb. Hubby loved that mushrooms and jalapenos on the regular burger don't cost extra.  The mini burger (or whatever it is called) is 1 patty while the regular sized burger is 2. 1 patty was plenty for both me and the hubby. The fry portions are GENEROUS. We went to order a large fry and the cashier taking our order kindly informed us that a large was sized to feed 4-5 people. The small portion of fries was plenty for the two of us. They were served in a brown paper bag and we doused them with malt vinegar and some extra salt. They were delicious and not too greasy.  Prices are pretty reasonable- 2 mini (but sufficient) burgers; and an order of fries was about $12 after tax. With drinks or larger burgers that price would have gone up; but that's the case anywhere that doesn't do \meal deals\"".  Word to the allergic- peanuts are served at the door and kept in open boxes at the front of the restaurant. I didn't see any signs warning about this before you go into the restaurant; which was a bit disappointing since peanut allergies can be so severe.""",0
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,The place is so crowded with people lined up. The burger was amazing; came with regular size but it just simply melting in your mouth. Even though the place was super busy; the staff still motivated; and offer a friendly service. This is the best burger in AZ; as we tried all other fast food outlet. Tried the hotdog as well; but the burger much better. This is a must stop when you are at AZ .,1
XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,I appreciate the fresh; not frozen way of doing business. I appreciate the friendly and efficient service.  I really dig the Cajun seasoning for the Cajun fries.  That said - it's an OK burger place. Nothing spectacular; but unlike most of the big name fast food burger places - at least this tastes like food.  It's handy to have right down the street from my office - and it fills the need when I get a burger craving.,1
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Where to begin... this is a defective Chipotle. The last 3 times I have been here the burritoistas FAIL at making a simple burrito. They do not seem to understand the proper portions in order to get everything rolled into a nice; appetizing  package-- instead I end up waiting forever while they take turns trying to roll ripped tortillas with bean water and sour cream leaking out of all its orifices. After some guy is literally manhandling the damn thing 20 different times re-wrapping in different tortillas and asking for assistance from every staff member there... I have a look of utter disgust seeing the insides ooze everywhere like vomit. It looks so unappetizing after they struggle and flail there arms trying to wrap this garbage (I've literally never seen so much over-exaggerated  shoulder gyrations since Richard Simmons Sweatin' to the Oldies)-- I'd rather have my money back.   Finally; some very sweet competent employee asks if I would like it remade..sorry I know there are starving people in the world; but yes please... I would love you to remake it so my burrito's insides do not resemble entrails. Thank you.  And to the rude cashier....get over yourself. I get that your job sucks; but the customer deserves a decent burrito when it costs $9.00. And oh yeah... I'm gonna take 2 bags whether you like it or not.,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Not bad; but not outstanding. The employees were able to get my order right the first time and it was affordable. The food was good enough; but the place was somewhat crowded and there were not quite enough employees to handle the influx of customers.,1
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,07/01/2013   3:00 p.m.   Attention Management:  Employees at this location are not adhering to the quality standards that are expected of all Chipotle Mexican Grills.  Line employees are taking shortcuts in not giving customers their full due; i.e. serving extremely noticeable smaller portions; and not sticking to the standard.  And since Chipotle is the McDonalds of the Mexican food world; how would the employees feel if they ordered a Big Mac and received buns with out a meat patty?  I'd rather you just rob me outside of your store; than to go inside and be greeted by smiley faces (great job by the way); but then charged $6.25+ tax for a small and very junior burrito - these are not the standards set by Chipotle.  I will be keeping a close watch on this location; and will give it another chance; but am hoping that the employees will come up short once again so that I can post the picture online with receipt.  Believe me; I would like nothing better than to escalate this situation to the corporate level.  Consumers in a post 2008 recession are tired of being taken for a ride.  As of 07/01/2013 - this location has received a C- in quality from me and will be watched and tested at an unknown time to gauge if the actions and lack of quality are still continuing.,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,I love this Chipotle location and I won't eat at any other. I actually have one really close to my house and their rice's usually hard so I just stopped going there. I also tried the one in Buckeye once and they gave me so little food; I had to and buy something else to eat when I was done. I know at some other location on the East side the staff makes you pick between rice OR beans; you can only get ONE salsa; etc. So that's annoying.  But this location's awesome!! We go here once a week. I wait and wait patiently until Friday (I could eat here every single day but that's the only day of the week I eat out and I MUST have Chipotle) and it's the happiest day of the week :)  I usually order online at like 8 am as soon as I get to work; (I'm telling ya; I wait patiently all week for my burrito bowl!) and when I get there at noon my food's ready. Sometimes I gotta wait in line because other customers get there before I do but I usually don't have to wait for my food to be ready (maybe it's because they've had my request for 4h but who cares? I really just wanna eat at that point :))  The manager already knows us and I can talk to him if something's not fine with my order. He actually stops by every Friday to make sure we're happy customers. I mean; how many fast food restaurant managers do this? I don't know any!  Their portions lately have been a little bit smaller than what I'm used to; specially when it comes to the amount of meat they serve so I'll keep an eye on that and talk to him if necessary and I'm also having to order extra rice because; well; it looks like they're serving less too. Or it may be the person that prepares my bowl at the to go window; who knows?  In any case; if you're Downtown Phoenix and you want something yummy and inexpensive to eat; GO TO CHIPOTLE!! Lunch hour's busy every day of the week (specially Monday-Friday) but the food's worth it!  If you can; order online and save yourself a few minutes; they're good about it and when they haven't been; I've told them and they've taken care of me (giving me a free meal or apologizing for the inconvenience and not letting it happen again).  Keep in mind this is a fast food restaurant but their food's still great (reason why their line to order food at lunch time's so long). They also serve meat from naturally raised animals and when they don't have this meat available; they make sure they have sing at the door to let you know (in case this is one of the reasons you go to Chipotle so you don't have to wait for 20 min to order your food and find out THEN that your naturally raised meat isn't gonna be the one you're gonna be eating today) so I think that's pretty cool.  The price for extra guac is excessive in my opinion but that's the way it is everywhere else so no different than subway or any other restaurant here.   Now if I could only find good copy cat recipes to make my own bowls at home... YUM!!,1
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,"Like every Friday; I went to Chipotle with my coworkers. We love it so much; we order online at 8 am as soon as we get to the office. My burrito bowl's ALWAYS perfect but  today it had beans and I have an extreme aversion to beans so I had to go back and tell them to prepare a different one...   Well; I hadn't even arrived to the to go window when the manager saw me waiting with my burrito bowl on my hands and asked if everything was OK. I explained what happened and gave him the receipt for my online order and he; himself; got in the kitchen and made me a new burrito bowl! This guy rocks! He always takes really good care of me and he stops by our table and asks if everything's ok. No need to do this at a \fast food\"" restaurant but he delivers and this is why I keep coming every single week.   The food's great and so are the prices but the customer service at this location's outstanding; specially at noon when the restaurant's packed; he still found the time fix me another bowl.  I'm telling you; he rocks!!  See you next Friday!!""",1

fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Fabulous location. Always well staffed and service is always above average despite the long lines.,1
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,First off this location is too busy; the line moves okay; but be ready to stand in it for 20 min or more.   Think ordering online will save you time? WRONG. It takes just as long to get your food there. Why you may ask? They only have one poor girl back there with no help filling orders by phone and in person.   What happens when this place doesn't staff their locations appropriately? They give you the wrong order; no joke missing items; wrong type of tortillas and cold; soggy food.   I love Chipotle; but you would be better off going to a different location.,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Fan of Chipotle and this location because it's downtown-City Scape and it's also convenient because work is just down the street but they always seem to get my order wrong or forget to add an item.   Monday-Friday around noon (lunchtime) this place is always hopping. It's best to order online and go to pick-up window but sometimes that too is busy.,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,I cannot even begin to explain how angry I am at the customer service I received last night and the amount of ingredients in  my dishes. I quarter size of barbacoa in each taco and in my bowl...Wow! Tiny scoop of rice and beans and quarter amount of sour cream. Meat. rice and cheese. I have been coming to this location for so many years and to be treated like this with the money I pay is unacceptable! I had a c I asked 4 times for more of each item and they rolled their eyes at me and ignored me! My bowl was almost empty the way it was served  My coworker with me that was treated the same way and complained about the amount of food in his burrito and the girls became even more rude! I am really upset about this because I have paid a lot of my money over the years to this location and I was treated like dirt and I would never treat anyone with this much disrespect and much less a paying customer! Thank you for ripping me off and ruining my experience last night! I will post a picture of what it looked like too!,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,HEY CHIPOTLE!  Here's a big BRONX CHEER and big middle finger to you.  You totally ruined my trip and attitude merely hours in my time in Phoenix.  Know why?  You ran out of goddamn guacamole before 1 pm.  BEFORE ONE PM.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK.  ARE YOU FOR REALZ?  I waited in line; which by the way would have moved a lot faster if not for the incompetence behind the counter.  I waited in line; patiently; figuring I'd get my burrito bowl in no time.  I swear; Chipotle workers just work SLOWER so as for people to buy into the hype for their product (they do that here in NYC so it's no different).  So as I order; I say I'd like the veggie bowl.  Veggie bowls come with guac.  Don't you think THEN would have been a good time for them to mention - oh; hey; by the way; sorry for the inconvenience but we're actually OUT of guac.  Nope!  I find out only when I'm about to finish my order.  I left because I was so disappointed.  You people BLOW!  Now; the worst part is that because of this snafu I had to go to the far less superior Baja Fresh.  I was sick them entire weekend because of this meal.  All because Chipotle didn't have the common decency to have guacamole or enough.  I mean; isn't that your JOB??? To have INVENTORY???  What the FUCK? Meanwhile; this set off a chain of events that I didn't get ONE of my food orders right when I was there.    So a big FUCK YOU to Phoenix central Chipotle.  I will never set foot in here again; which I guess is good for you because I don't live there.  But unfortunately I am an elite reviewer on Yelp so sucks for you that I had a bad experience. #BlameChipotle,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,What can I say; Chipotle is Chipotle and I will continue to eat here until the end of my days. However; this location is exceptional because of service from the employee's. The line is continually out the door and they always handle the mad rush with great composure. I believe Paul is the manager on most occasions when I visit and he really knows how to rally the troops and keep things moving making it a much more enjoyable experience for the lunch rushers. Come here for your typical Chipotle meal but with a guaranteed satisfactory experience with the staff.,1
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,I like this location because its right across from the valley metro stop at 1st and jefferson. I've stopped here to grab a quick bite before catching a departing flight out of town. The chipotle is located in a complex right across from the stop so its not far to lug my luggage. And typically i order the burrito bowl because its a quick assembly line creation so no waiting for them to cook my meal. And my reason for stopping here is to avoid the higher prices at the airport,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,I can never go wrong with Chipotle. I usually get a burrito bowl with steak which is almost always cooked a PERFECT medium rare. Add fajita veggies; pico; red salsa and guac and I have a good lunch.  I work a few blocks a way and was diasspointed that; after ordering online; they had not even started on my order. So it is usually a time saver to just walk in and order. They usually turn out your meal quickly so lesson learned:don't bother ordering online.  Other than that; the food is fresh and it's a hell of a lot better for you than McDonald's.,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Pretty good food for lunch time. I definitely recommend ordering on-line to avoid waiting in line.,0
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Had an interview downtown & decided to walk over. Great location. There was a line but that's because the food is so good! Service was friendly; professional & efficient. Food was plentiful and flavorful.,1
fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Great location. Awesome online order process. So easy to use and understand. Pick-up window makes it that much more convenient. Staff was friendly & helpful. Very personable & quick. Food was perfect portions & still warm in the office 15 min later.,1
SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,"This is a welcome dinner destination after practice with my swim team in the nearby Student Recreation Center of ASU.  The place is small; clean; and basic; service is fast. Simple menu and tasty; healthy food at a good price. My favorite is \The Works\"" - beef; chicken; veggies; and rice; topped with green onion; I jazz it up a bit with sriacha because I like this kind of food spicy.""",0
SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,"This small place is certainly tasty; I wanted to get a rice bowl for sure... I asked the lady at the counter what was the most popular dish if I'd never been here & she was very nice and helpful in helping us order. I got the Works Bowl which has beef and chicken along with veggies. You have a choice of white or brown rice and then green onions or not. The Brown rice is a bit extra; but what's healthier and cheaper? That doesn't exist. The \magic sauce\"" is delicious; even though it's just sweet teriyaki sauce. & they have the tea stand with 4 different types of Teas. My favorite! Look for coupons before you go in; great place to satisfy a rice fix and save a few bucks!""",1
SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,"Flame Broiler may be a basic franchise; but it serves its purpose quite well! I enjoy the strip mall that this is set in; next to great locals like Delhi Palace; Blue Nile Cafe; Pho Nhat and Oliveo Grill. I think that my stomach is typically full and happy when eating at any of these establishments.   I went in with little expectation; and ordered \The Works\"" which comes with veggies (cabbage; green onions; zucchini and broccoli); chicken and beef. Imagine my happy surprise upon receiving a sukiyaki-style beef! Tokyo Express fans; get your chopsticks out; because it tastes nearly the same as theirs. So; for its no frills and straight forward approach to making some good rice bowls; they really do succeed and it makes a great lunch place!""",0
SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,I love Flame Broiler. But this one is a bit harder to enjoy. Food was not as good as I usually get. But my biggest beef was the music - it was so loud that it was hard to hear the woman behind the counter as I was ordering. I said the music was really loud. She just smiled at me. Maybe she couldn't hear me?   I may return but won't eat in again.,0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,"I can best describe the chicken as \KFC done right.\"" The batter is tasty but not too greasy. The employees have outstanding customer service and regularly ask how everything is. Furthermore the atmosphere is inviting and creates a since of positivity. For a fast-food joint; I really don't see a reason to \""raise Cain.\"" This fine place deserves your hunger.""",1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Pretty sure I dream about the Texas toast. They kind of have that In n Out vibe in that they only serve one thing; but they do it really really well. Service is fast and friendly. The chicken tenders are never dry. Portions are great. The prices are good; too- it costs me more to hit up Burger King for the same order; and obviously this place is much better than Burger King.,1

Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,If you want some of the best chicken tenders ever; come here!  Been here a few times and have gotten the tenders; fries; texas toast and lemonade.  The tenders are to die for!  Nicely breaded but not so breaded that it overpowers the chicken.  Tastes like real chicken; not any processed crap.  Nice and hot; great taste.  And the dipping sauce they give you is amazing!  That stuff is addicting.  The crinkle cut fries are nothing special but very solid.  Not bad by any means but just  nothing to write home about.  The texas toast doesn't look like anything special but its actually very good.  I'd recommend laying a tender on the toast and having an open-faced sandwich.  They say the lemonade is fresh squeezed; I didn't really believe it but I love a good lemonade so I ordered it even though it was an extra $.30.  OH MY GOD BEST 30 CENTS I HAVE EVER SPENT!  They are not lying when they say it is fresh squeezed.  Easily some of the best lemonade I have ever had.  The pricing is pretty decent for what you are getting.  Their 6 tender meal with 3 sides (fries; toast and cole slaw are advertised but you can substitute any of them for extra of something else.  I get either extra fries or toast in place of slaw); 2 sauces and a large drink is going to come out to around 8 or 9 bucks.  Could be a little cheaper for the amount you are getting but the quality of the food justifies it.  My only real complaint is that they need to give out more sauce!  If the worst thing about this place is they need to give out more of their fantastic sauce; I'd say it's a place worth trying.  Highly recommend!,0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Super busy Saturday night due to the ASU sun devils game.  Even tho it was rowdy and packed with people we had no trouble finding a quiet corner to enjoy our meal.  It was our first time at this joint and it seemed pleasant.  Staff was very polite; kept the place clean; fully stocked; and got our orders out quick and correct.   Food was delicious and filling! Love their texas toast and fries!,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,I don't get it.  This place is packed but the food is marginal at best. The best part is the sweet tea. This was my first visit and I will not return. Not because of the service which was great. Even though I know it's bad for me I would rather go to KFC for the variety and great flavor. C- or D+.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Its a knockoff of Zaxby's. Not that I'm mad or saying it a bad thing because Zaxby's is awesome! I've visited RC's University location several times; and no doubt will be back again.  RC's chicken tenders are excellent and their sauce is perfect for dipping. Crinkle cut fries are hot and taste fresh to order. The Box is a good amount of food and perfect if you are hungry for more than just a snack.   Anddddd they have sweet tea! :heart:   I thought the price for the amount of food was fair and service was friendly and fast!  They have a promotion that is a little annoying in that when Sun Devils win they tell you to come in for free chicken tenders but its basically a 'well played' marketing scam :P if it wasn't for their scummy ploy then I would gladly give 5 stars.,0

Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,This is absolutely the best fast food chicken I have had.  The service is great and quick.  I have been there 4 times in the past month and every time the service is great and the food is fresh.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,"Like it!  Simple menu and fast service are a good start.  Meals all seem to be a pretty good value for what you receive.  The fingers were fresh & tasty; fries & slaw also very good.  Didn't have that \I ate a greasy fried lunch\"" feeling an hour later; like some fried stuff will do to you.. that's a huge plus.  Not quite to the high standard of the now-defunct Rock & Roll Fingers; but close.  A solid 4 stars; and will definitely be back.""",1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,I've been here a couple of times   The service is good the staff very friendly. But their food is mediocre at best. I really don't understand why everyone LOVES this place.  I would much rather go somewhere else to satisfy my chicken strip craving.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,"It's a chain; so if you've been to one all you need to know this is one is particularly clean and has great hours; but service can be slow when crowded.   If you are new to cane's the simple question to answer is can you eat chicken? No? Sorry; you're unlucky. Yes? Run; don't walk your way here! Chick-Fil-A can keep the chicken sandwich; these guys invented the chicken finger! Just get three things: chicken fingers; sweet tea; and sauce. The fries are ok; so is the toast; but really everything here is just filler. The sauce should be tested it's that addicting it's a little warm but not spicy and the sweet tea might be liquid sugar; but no part of your tongue will care. The chicken itself is juicy and will not last. Within minutes you will have a \i ate the bones\"" moment.  Faults? Price. After tax I spend around nine dollars which is a different tax bracket compared to most fast food; but it's a great occasional guilty pleasure.""",0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Holy crap this place is spectacular! Customer service is their number one priority and the people who take your order even make me laugh on the regular. Their other number one priority is quality chicken. Thats's right; they have two number one priorities. They are multitasking their excellence! Also they will substitute stuff like if I don't want coleslaw i can just have more fries or another AMAZING dipping sauce. Oh man I just remembered the sauce. I gotta go guys; i need to go eat some raising cane's. You should too; but lemme get my order in first.,1

Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Everyone always raves about Raising Cane's; so naturally I had to go and give it a try. I'm generally very health conscious and not a fan of fried food and wouldn't go out of my way to eat it either. But we were close by and I really wanted to know what the deal was with this place.  The inside looks very nice. It is clean and has an appealing decor. The menu looked very simple; we ordered two of The Box; which comes with (I think) 4 fried chicken strips; cole slaw; fries; a buttery toast; and a special sauce.  The chicken was good; the meat inside actually looked and tasted like chicken. The sauce had interesting flavors. I really liked the cole slaw though; and the toast... I think totally unnecessary and just adds more carbs to the meal. They should offer some healthier options to that; maybe some apple slices or a side salad? The overall experience was very pleasant.  As I said; I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go and eat there but I would definitely let friends peer pressure me in going :),0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Tried Raising Cane's for the first time.  It wasn't bad.  It was flavorful but for the price it won't be my go to chicken place.  I prefer the other popular fried chicken place (from Louisiana).  I ordered the Caniac Combo with the 6 tenders.  The chicken is good.  The sauce is great.  It's just that 2 meals costs $18?  To me that is a little steep for fast food chicken.  The coleslaw was my least favorite.  The TexasTtoast was a nice compliment to the meal.  If I was with a group and they wanted Raising Cane's I would go back.,0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,This place does a fine job at cooking chicken tenders and fries. They even got the Texas toast down to a perfection.  Came in here while trolling around Tempe and decided to give them a shout out. Located very close to ASU and should be a popular spot when you need to catch some bird.  Ordered the biggest thing on the menu called the Caniac Combo. Stopped drinking the dreaded soda pop and went with some dihydrogen monoxide. It is a lot better for you and the price of the combo goes down quite a bit.  The menu here is very simple and they give you a basic no thrills meal. You can always substitute some of the sides if you so desire. The big thing everyone cries about is the top secret sauce. Maybe I missed the boat on this one but it is nothing more than some doctored up mayonnaise.  Food is pretty good and the chicken is very tender. Good chance they are doing that southern trick of marinating it in some seasoned butter milk overnight. That always keeps it juicy and flavorful after frying.  Would like to see some more dipping sauces. Just take some regular Franks hot sauce and add equal parts of brown sugar and simmer it in a pan. Some country fried chicken gravy would be good also. Maybe just offer some jalapenos or something spicy to add a little kick.  Definity gets really busy around lunch time. Saw tons of sweaty blue collar workers (like me) coming in and chowing down on big plates of chicken. Some of them looked like they could have skipped the soda pop as well.  Recommend bringing your own dipping sauce or hot sauce to complete the occasion. Some people just need more options. CLUCK CLUCK A-OK!  3.25 STARS,0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Tried Raising Cane's for the first time -- Amazing!!  I love that this place is ASU orientated. You have the Sun Devil Logos and vibe. The restaurant is clean and appealing.   I ordered the Box Combo: 4 Chicken Fingers; 1 coleslaw; 1  Texas Toast; Fries; and a drink. The food came out in less than a minute; which dazzled me.   I sat down and began my meal. First; the TOAST! My new favorite! The Texas toast was amazingly soft and incredibly tasty. The french fries were good; as well as the coleslaw. As for the chicken; it was juicy and tender.   Overall; the food and combination was GREAT. Will come back!!,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,I was delighted to see Raising Cane's near ASU as I have tried it before in Las Vegas and really liked the food. Normally I get either the box combo or the 3 finger combo depending on what I'm in the mood for. If it's your first time the box combo is a great sampler for their menu on what they have to offer. Given the proximity to ASU there are loads of college students that come through here but what I like is that they are open late which makes RC a great option for take out. As far as the food this is what I thought:  Chicken Fingers = Main reason for coming here in the first place. They are definitely above average and go well with the dipping sauce. Texas Toast = Nice and soft and I like the flavor. Coleslaw = It's just okay but goes well with the box combo meal. Nice to see some veggies though. French Fries = They are okay; just your average fries I guess. Keep in mind that they are crinkle cut instead of regular fries. Sauce = I'm a fan of the sauce but I do wish they have more choices of sauces in general; as this seems important for finger food.  Overall a great spot and despite being fast food I do like coming back here. The service is fast and the pricing for the combos is great value.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,The chicken and bread-delectable. The sauce- good; and the fries-meh. Good price and good customer service. Would go back next time I'm in the area.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Sometimes the size of the chicken strips is a bit suspect in the box meals. If you want the most bang for your buck order the sandwich with an extra side of Texas toast.,0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,In terms of taste; all of their competitors make much better chicken. However; if you're hungry for late night munchies; I suppose anything is worth 5 stars. Service is always exceptional; though. I like the concept of the small menu because it makes the whole thing really simple for both the customers and the employees.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,This is a second time to this new location...  Guess what????  It's still great...  The family hit the store about 11:00 this morning and we had the place to ourself... Don't know if its because of the long weekend or the ASU students haven't found it yet... Food was hot & good; service was great; place was clean and neat...  ASU; students your missing out on this place... old Devil...,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Had an issue; and the management immediately solved it. No eye rolling; just respect for food and great service. Awesome. At this point they could spit on the food; and I would be happy.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,I know people who rave WILDLY about Raising Cane's; but I just think it's okay. I've eaten their twice; once drive-thru another I ordered inside. The service is quick and friendly and the restaurant is always clean. If you want something flavorful; I would suggest going somewhere else. But if you have a chicken tenders craving; you probably can't go wrong here.,1

Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Went to this place this afternoon; not knowing any thing about it. It had people inside and cars in the parking lot so I decited to check it out. Simple menu made deciding what to eat easy. The service was quick and the food was brought to my table. The chicken fingers were good; however I think the fries left some thing to be desired.  Over all; not bad. I'll be back.,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Decide to try this place and was a bit disappointed that  I waste my time and money on it. I thought it was going to be some spectacular food when it taste no different then chicken strips you would get at Sonic; McDonalds; etc.  Its way OVERPRICED. I wasnt happy that there was only one dipping sauce flavor. It was gross. We also ordered the sandwhich and wasnt too happy it had that sauce spread all over it.  I asked for larger Lemonade and was given a small size.   The coleslaw tasted funny so want fond of that. Only thing I ate was the texas toast and that was pretty weak too.,0

The chicken was SUPER hot; I couldn't eat for 10 minutes. Fries were good but the portions were really small :/ I really didn't even want the Texas toast at first thinking eww a big piece of bread? But it's actually REALLLY good!!! The meal came with a side of their secret sauce which was pretty tasty.   The customer service was great; an employee checked up on us to see if we needed anything and offered to throw out our trash. The place was very clean and seemed well kept. I will come back again if I ever need a fix for fried chicken deliciousness""",1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,This place is pretty cool! I like the actual restaurant. The decor is awesome and I like their disco ball! Good music for college students and perfect location for ASU students!  The food is delicious but would def not eat it regularly. Super greasy (would be great after a night on Mill tho). The chicken fingers were fresh and all white meat. Super crispy! And the sauce goes well with it. There is a copious amount of fries that went with the meal. Btw I ordered the Caniac. 6 chicken fingers; texas toast (which was bomb but also greasy) ; cole slaw; and a pile of fries. And a large drink.  when I say greasy though...its not swimming in oil. Just the right amount of grease i think. It could get salty but the coleslaw cuts the saltiness. Perfect balance.  Would definitely comeback! I wanna try their sandwiches!  The combo meal I got came out to 8.98... Kinda pricey but it fed me and my sister pretty well.   3.5 stars!!!!!,0
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Good place; good service.  The food's good too; but you better like chicken fingers.  Much in the style of In-N-Out burger; this place goes with a very minimalist menu - chicken fingers and fries.  The food was good but not having any choices bores me...,1
Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,"Going to college in Tallahassee; the one spot that was a winner for everyone was \Guthrie's of Tallahassee\""... Same style menu & the staple of a college meal here at Raising Cane's. Even more fitting that it's near ASU Campus. Chicken Fingers; Fries; Texas Toast & coleslaw (swap-able). Granted; it's a chain with locations globally I believe; but it still provides that same level of comfort I had back in school... A simple and great tasting meal!!!  Its a basic concept & they keep it simple. They sell chicken tenders and that's what I like about them. Expanding the menu to do \""too much\"" would take away from things; so hopefully they keep it simple. If ur a dipping person like me; order an extra sauce or exchange the coleslaw for another item like toast!""",0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Burgers always good... they cook the fries in peanut oil... they are on the softer side so if you like crispy fries... you may not like these... they are delicious though.  FYI... the little burger is one patty... the regular burger is two patties...  all cooked fresh to order and they have to cool coke machines too...  Oh; and while you wait there are open boxes of peanuts you can snack on while you wait for your food.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Pluses:  Service; priced well for what they are attempting (attempting being the key word) clean; fun atmosphere.  Minuses: I had the burger with A1.  It was smothered in A1 overpowering.  Made the bun super soggy.  Burgers are well done;  no other option.  Only American cheese no other cheese choice.  Really?  Fries were unevenly cooked.  Some were still white others crispy-very inconsistent.,1
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,If you are looking for a burger; you can't really go wrong with Five Guys.   I also make a Five Guys run when I'm craving fresh; hot french fries. I'd love to avoid this; but I'm weak.   Major pluses are the menu layout here; and the attentiveness of staff. I have been to this location a handful of times and order came out perfect every time. Given that there are so many permutations to ways people like their burgers; I appreciate the attention to detail. I'd go so far to say that I don't typically get this kind of attention to detail in many sit down restaurants.   Only drawback for me is take out; as your burger will be soggy when you get home. Advise if you are planning on grabbing family dinner on your way home; to be sure to have them put the sauce in a side container for you.   Other drawback is eating all your fries before your burger and not getting through your burger...,1
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,I've been hearing people rave about this place for so long so we finally decided to come out & try it.  I was most excited for their fries because apparently; that's what everyone says they are amazing at.  We ordered & waited about 10 min; there were maybe 8 other people in the whole place (who were already eating I should add).  We finally received our food & my bun was cold; almost stale tasting & the fries were soggy.  They say they make the fries fresh each time which I'm really not buying because we waited so long & these were not made fresh whatsoever.  My burger was just okay; I've had much better; I think the bun really killed it for me.   The toppings are free so you can add as many as your tummy desires which my husband liked. I'm not going to be rushing back here anytime soon.  I think I'll stick to In-N-Out when a burger craving hits.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Go to Burger King it's better than this store. Don't get me wrong I usually love 5 Guys Burgers but I've been to this specific restaurant twice and both times I've had bad experiences.   First time they put one piece of lettuce on my burger. I was so pissed and felt that they were probably short on it so I didn't say anything. Really 1 small piece? Fries were also undercooked and soggy.    Today as I was driving around I decided to try it again just in case they had a bad day on my first visit. I ordered the same as I have before when my order was ready I noticed my burger meat patty was so flat I didn't know if it was because they were messing with me or a training issue.  The bun was stale and the fries (you guessed it undercooked and soggy).  I am done and decided to just go elsewhere.   Needless to say I will NEVER go to this store again.   Management should focus on training staff on freshness and not pushing stale buns. Also don't flatted the patty to the point that you don't taste it.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,I like Five Guys Burgers and Fries.  They are up there with In and Out Burger.  In and Out Burgers are presented all nice and tidy; Five Guys Burgers and Fries are more in your face.  I have to open wide to take that initial bite.  It is a good juicy; drippy; carnivorous delight.  I always order the Cheeseburger.  I like being able to add toppings to the burger when you order.  It makes it easy.  The fries are good; almost over seasoned.  Almost.  I still ate them all.  4 stars.  I am a fan.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,I am from the home of the original Five Guys burger joint in the Washington; DC area. Now they're all over the USA and I have never been to a Five Guys anywhere that was not the same burger and fries as I had the first time I ate one when I was in Junior High. It's always consistent and I think it's the best burger you can get for under $6 anywhere.  I love In N Out. I love Five Guys just a tiny bit more.   2 different experiences (no peanuts to enjoy while you wait at In N Out and not as clean at Five Guys) and Five Guys costs more; but one order of fries and a burger might convert you if you already have a favorite burger joint.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,"Welcome Five Guys!!!! Great choice for a location - as there is a Fudruckers right across the street; that sucks.   It's next to Paradise (also new) in a strip mall setting. The location is huge; clean; organized. Outdoor seating; shade; lots of tables; and great service.   The only downside; and this is for all locations; the decor is too close to In-N-Out. Not something to count against a star being deducted.   I gave them 4 not 5 stars because they are new and have kinks to work out. Yet have to be open for awhile to really \wow\"" people. When you have so many dining selections in the Arrowhead Mall area; you need to have somethin that makes me and other ppl say \""dinehere\""..   They use real meat; not processed. Fry orders are huge; always a ton to take home. The seasoned fries is basically similar to the stuff they have at Red Robin or Chuys (for the chips). It's good.   Overall a good burger. Yum!""",1

PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,This review is a review of the corporate stores such as this one. I love their food but there is one thing that always makes me second guess going to Five Guys and I am sure you know what it is. The music. I am a very patient person but every time I walk into these places I want to walk right out. Don't go here if you are on a date or plan to visit with anybody. You will not be able to hear them without everyone else hearing the conversation. Thank god this one restaurant does have outdoor seating and there is no music. What you'll feel like when you go to these restaurants is that you're having five guys screaming at you the whole meal. Please turn the music down so people can enjoy each other's company and  also enjoy the food. Aside from the very loud music of this restaurant is the fact that when you order the most basic of the meals at this restaurant you will feel like someone picked hour pocket. Don't get me wrong the food is fresh tasting but I can feed a small family with what I have spent eating here and that's just a combo. Five guys you could be so much more!,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Loved this place back in California. It's pretty much the same here but a couple things I noticed that made me dock stars:   1.  THEY DON'T USE FRESH MUSHROOMS. I always get grilled mushrooms on my burgers and these were soggy and had a sour aftertaste like canned mushrooms. I had to pick them out :( 2. Lots of kids working here= poor service quality 3. Fries didn't have the cajun seasoning...or maybe they just didn't put enough of it? They were somehow lacking.  4. They had the cool coke machines with the gazillion different flavors but I just got a coke and they needed to refill the syrup; the coke wasn't sweet at all :( I guess that goes more with the service complaint.   Not a big fan of this location but I will definitely try out others.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,I was very excited it try this burger joint and was very disappointed. I ordered a hamburger and they made a cheeseburger. I sent it back and told the guy i didnt want cheese. So he made it again and guess what; it had cheese AGAIN! By the time I actually got my burger without cheese; I was full from eating fries and my husband's burger was cold because he was waiting for me. They didn't even offer to comp us for  anything.  I also thought it was dirty. The floors needed to be sweeped and the trash needed to be emptied. With so many other choices out there; I won't go back.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,My husband chose Five guys for his birthday lunch.  I usually do not eat the bun with burgers but I decided to cheat since it was his birthday. The owner came over and asked how we liked our burgers and I advised him It was amazing especially the bun.  I said it's probably because I hadn't eaten bread in so long; but even still GREAT!  He said a great healthy alternative is their BLT.  He described it and I agreed it sounded good. The next thing we knew he showed up at our table with a BLT for free.  I thanked him and he said it was ultimately a selfish act as he knew I'd be hooked. HE WAS RIGHT!  I have NEVER had a BLT like this.  I wanted to finish it so badly; but I couldn't.  I know they are known for the burgers and fries; but if you like BLT's you need to try their version.  Excellent service; great music; and peanuts for free!,1
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,I know this is a burger joint; but their french fries are AWESOME!  I ordered the bacon cheese burger (I should have ordered the light - 1 patty instead of 2).  It was too much for me.  I again should have ordered the small fries not the normal size.  The soda machines are fun.  I had orange vanilla HC drink.  YUM...  I wanted to look through the machine to see what other options but I had someone behind me.    Minus -1 star:  The seat hurt my butt or I need more meat on my butt.  LOL!,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Good burgers; but the prices seem to have gone up since the last time we were at one of these places. Two burgers and an order of fries to split seemed a bit steeper than I remembered. Even so; I still like the food; especially since they have malt vinegar freely available. Meaty burgers; not greasy ones; decent service and picking whatever toppings you want.,1

PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Someone took my order instead of hers on mistake and left. The staff was so courteous; they gave us large fries instead of little for the extra wait and completely refunded our $20. Great customer service!,1

PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Went there last night after my brother kept saying they had the best burgers around.   Ordered the regular bacon cheese burger; fries and a drink. Burger was cooked just right; but I wasn't a fan of the cheese they used; don't remember getting a choice. Fries were OK and you get a bunch if them; so order less than you think you might want.   Not a fan of the pick your own coke machine; too many choices and you end up standing in line waiting for people to push all the different buttons. Plus it's a Coke machine; but NO cherry coke option.  Decor is spartan and utilitairian; wood stools and tables with a tile floor; there are some metal tables and chairs outside. Music was way too loud and we left as soon as we finsihed eating because of the noise. Maybe that's why it's so loud; to turn the tables quicker.  It was OK; but I'd rather do Samshburger. Better fries; service; intertior and soda machine.,0

PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Of all the burger places in the area; this is my favorite. Love all the toppings and the freshness of the burger.  I know everyone raves about the fries & I have to agree. What's makes them taste so great is the freshness...their kind of old-fashioned in the way that they are like home made. They are amazing. I do think this place is a little pricey. 30bucks for burgers fries & drinks is a lot for 2 people.  But I guess that's how it is these days...at least it tastes great!  My only complaint about this location is the customer service.  They people aren't overly friendly or welcoming...they have a job to do & they do it. Nothing terrible or overly rude; but I like a smile with my meal.,0
PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,"Really only giving it a 4 because of how great the food was.   Today was my first time going here and we ordered 2 burgers; a fry and a pop.   First; I like how they name their burgers; the regular burgers are doubles and then the \littles\"" only have a single patty-- pretty innovative. Also; condiments are free so you can maximize your dollar by getting every topping you want on it! Super awesome!  So I loaded up my burger and when we got our order; but my burger was lacking. They didn't put all of the condiments on it; which would have been a complete bummer if I had gotten to-go. Luckily; we ate in so I was able to tell them. The customer service wasn't rude or stand-offish; they were just very \""blah\"". The employees seemed very bored and uninterested; not quick to help.   The feel of this restaurant is kind of cool except a few things: -The music was too loud -The soda pop machine was so \""advanced\"" it was confusing to use and we had to ask someone for help (super awkward) -It's almost as if they expect/force you to get to-go. They don't ask you if it's \""for here or to go\""; they automatically package your stuff up. Therefore; eating in was a bit of a hassle.   So basically; this place gets four stars because the food was absolutely delicious.""",0

lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,Extremely disappointed with the service I received today. For being a Sunday and being prime lunch time there were only about 2-3 people ahead of us when we got to the tortilla press yet not one person greeted us when we entered the building; not even the manager who was working on the line. Then when we did get to the line we received no greeting other then 'what can I get for you.' Then was denied my request for a specific item that has been receiving A LOT of attention. I had requested a quesadilla and a burrito and was going to request that my burrito was wrapped with the quesadilla. Commonly being referred to as a 'quesaritto.'  The tortilla press worker didn't consult any other staff and did not take into consideration that there wasn't more then three people behind us. The entire mood of the restraint was actually quite dull. The only person who seemed to be in any type of friendliness was the girl working at the salsa station and even that was minimal. There was NOTHING exceptional or anything near the expectations that I have usually received for a chipotle visit. For the tortilla press girl to refuse my request like that was infuriating and to have an excuse such as 'we don't do that during certain hours' is ludicrous. If I were to visit ANY other establishment and request something off of their 'secret' menu I would never be denied.   Needless to say I am utterly disappointed with the entire visit and will also be posting said review on Yelp. I hope when I call into the store that they have a better explanation for why I was denied my request since this was the one thing I visited the store for today.   Also; for the individual just standing in plain site in a baseball cap and street clothes was the icing in the cake for me. I won't be returning to this location ever.   Only reason I'm giving this is a two star is because I still love the food.,0
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,The service at this location has always been great and the food has been really good in the past but as of late the quality of the food has declined. The steak has been over cooked and it just doesn't have the flavor other locations have. Overall the ingredients just don't have the same great taste that other locations have. The last 4 times I ate at this location have been a little disappointing. But I do need to stress the service is good and it's always clean in the resturant I just hope they can bring up the quality and taste of the food back to what they did in the past.,1
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,I've been coming here for YEARS (well; not this particular one; but you know what I mean) so it's a little surprising I haven't reviewed them yet!   This location is probably the best one I've been to-service is always awesome (44th & Thomas sucks with service; as does Camelback & the 51!); location is great-never had any issues with finding parking (unlike the one at Chandler mall = good luck!); and the food is always amazing!   So if you've never (**gasp**) been here before; it's pretty basic. They offer burritos; burrito & fajita bowls; salad bowls; and tacos (soft or hard; of course). Choose from chicken; steak; barbacoa; carnitas or vegitarian. Option of black or pinto bean. Salsa here is absolutely fantastic!! I ALWAYS get the corn & pico but they have a couple other options for those that like spicier. Obviously cheese; lettuce; sour cream; and guac are available to top it all off.   I always get the same thing- steak burrito bowl (no rice) with black beans; corn & pico salsa; cheese; and guacamole. My mouth is watering just THINKING about it and I just ate here yesterday!!   I love that they offer beer & margaritas in addition to the soda option-some days it's just necessary  The ONLY thing that annoys me (just a little) is that EVERY time I ask for guac; they inform me that it's $1.80 extra and is that ok? ugh. Obviously they musta had someone complain about not knowing; but seriously?,1
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,love this place.  however; the burrito will not get you out of a ticket for driving in the carpool lane. lol.  i have eatin at a few chipotles in the valley and this one has the best service.  they go the extra mile to make the best burrito,1
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,I would rather eat dog food. I have hated this place for years. The service us horrible.  The food is bland and flavors less.  And any place that charges $1.75 for guacamole is weak. I have no idea why so many people flock here.,0
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,I LOVE Chipotles spices they use on their steak and chicken like you cannot believe. What I do not love about this particular establishment is that it seems like every time I go they forget to add a part of my order to the to go bag. It takes me a little while to get here b/c of all the stupid traffic lights from my office off of price and southern.  So it is annoying to get to the office finding out they are forgetting to put someones food that was paid for and having to go back to get it or salad dressing for the salad. Kinda stuff that is crucial.  So annoying.,0
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,Boy I'm a hog in heaven again now that I've found this place. These burritos with the tin foil wrap make for the easiest lunches that are nice and filling. They also serve tacos; bowls and salads; but who wants those? I'm sure they're good; just haven't had one yet. Carne Asada burrito with no beans; extra rice; salsa; sour cream and cheese rocks.   Be prepared for lines around lunch; but they move quick so don't be alarmed. Friendly service is always there; epically when they tell you guacamole costs extra (only downside.)  This location does seem more oriented toward the lunch crowd as I've seen them bring out extra people to speed things up unlike other locations.  Hope to see you there.,1
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,First of all; I love Chipotle; their ingredients; food; quality of food; etc. The people who work at this particular location were not unfriendly; although there seemed to be a major lack of communication between the first and last person in the assembly line. My step son and I came in to get dinner to go for us and his dad. We explained to the first person that we had two free burritos or bowls of our choice with these little baseball card sized coupons. OK. So we get all the way to the end; the guy first doesn't recall me ordering my son's kids meal; then figures it out. Then he informs me I can only use one of these freebies  per transaction. Nope; doesn't say that; not even in the fine print;  but if you insist; then please just split it and we'll be on our way. They figured it out and we were on our way. Fast forward to eating our delicious meal at home and my steak in my burrito was uber gristly; and then to top it off; I BIT into a piece of plastic. Someone clearly wasn't paying attention to what they were cutting and let a piece of some kind of plastic into my burrito. Do mistakes happen? Yep. Am I likely to go to Chipotle again? You bet. This one? Not very likely. No it's not the people; no it's not the food; it has everything to do with how complicated they made us redeeming the coupons; and the foreign piece of plastic I bit into.,0
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,Chipotle is by far one of my favorite restaurants. It's healthy; or as healthy as you want it to be; fresh (they use local & organic whenever possible); and fast. They even have an app (but who doesn't these days) or take orders by fax. This location doesn't seem to have the usual high turnaround of most fast food type places and has several nice employees who remember my order and always smile and chat you up. My only complaint is they don't have red peppers like they're Cali stores. Of course when I asked I was told it's because they use whats best; fresh & local so I guess fresh green peppers are better than frozen red peppers.,1
lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,Not a fan of this location at all. I love chipotle as a whole and it's a great company   This location makes me think different. I usually go during my lunch break and it is usually quite busy but there service is terrible and they give you barely any rice or veggies but charge you an arm and a leg for there tiny portions. I went there yesterday and I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning. They need to step up there game.,0

lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,I love Chipotle usually; but when I went into the store for the first time a month ago I was HIGHLY disappointed. The customer service was pathetic. The girls just stared at me like I was in the wrong for bothering them in the middle of their conversation to order. I went back a week ago to give it another shot; because I believe in second chances; but the service was maybe one smile of a difference. They obviously don't care about their customers at this place and just want to be somewhere else.,0

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"The people at the register were friendly; now onto my review.  I thought I would try this place since it is one of the new places to eat around work. I ordered \The BOX\"" and got it to go. I was surprised just how long it took to get my food despite there being maybe 5 or 6 people sitting down at the tables and nobody else in line. I asked if they had other dipping sauces since special sauces are always disappointing; and they don't have any. Seriously? Not even BBQ? You specialize in chicken fingers and don't have BBQ? Ok fine; I'll try your sauce. It was terrible; I ate an entire finger using it hoping that it would get better; it didn't. I had to go find some hot sauce here at work since the chicken itself was so bland.  Chicken - Not bad texture wise; but bland.  Sauce - Terrible. Get more sauces; the one you tout as the best doesn't have the ability to stand on its own. Asking others in the office its either a love it/hate it verdict; which essentially means those who hate it won't be repeat customers.  Fries - Did you get these from Fry's across the street? Crinkle cut bland fries; yeah that sounds like store bought.  Texas Toast - Great  Coleslaw - Never been a fan; so no review here.   Apparently this place stays in business by those who actually like the sauce since everything else they serve is underwhelming.""",1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also; I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.  This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.,0
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I visited for the first time today.  The customer service was great.  The gal that took my order (I can't remember her name although she offered it) was very helpful explaining the menu.  The food was yummie and the service quick.  I like it!!,1

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"This place came very highly recommended from several people.  My husband works in the area and was anxiously awaiting it's grand opening.  He found out the history of the place and the owner; and so we decided it was a place we'd go.  We finally made it there yesterday.  The place was clean and the people were friendly.    The menu is small; but I like that.  Too many options overwhelm me.  Hubby and I both ordered the meal that came with 4 chicken strips; fries; toast and coleslaw.  Our kids got the kids meal.    We paid nearly $28. This is more than I had expected; and more than I'd care to pay in the future.  For fast food; this is outrageous.    The chicken was good.  Not too flavorful; but the breading was perfect; not too much.  The fries were soggy and under done.  I could do better at home in my home fryer.  The toast was; well; toast.  Nothing special there.  And the coleslaw was same as store bought; I'd had better.  The \famed\"" Cane Sauce was ok.  It didn't blow my mind and it wasn't gross.  Ketchup was available; which was good since my kids thought the Cane sauce was \""weird\"".  Ranch would have been more their taste.  We may go back if there is a location that pops up closer to where we live; and if we were kid-less for the meal.  It's too expensive otherwise.""",1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"2.5 stars  The short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff; but it's basically just-ok carby kid food.  The long: On the south side of Thomas; just west of 44th St.; turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic; but it's otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up; like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise; it doesn't stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period; and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick; though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush.   I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome; even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon; the drink was so sweet; it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo; a slab of soft-in-the-inside; perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast; somewhat slightly crisp; thin crinkle cut fries; a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce); and; of course; four chicken strips. Unless you're me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two; but really; halfway through the meal; you're so carbed-out full that you don't miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken; and true to advertising; it was fresh. Sort of crispy; but not as crispy as I'd hoped; or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I can't even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally; every time I took a bite of that toast; I'd think; \This is the most random slice of toast ever. What's it even doing here?\""   So; it's fine if you're like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this; but personally; I won't be making a return visit.  Edit: I almost threw my drink cup away before I noticed the giveaway pull tab on it--I won a free slice os Texas toast! How do you like them apples? =)""",1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,It was okay. I compare it to a place back home called Zaxby's. The girl suggested that I order the box so that i could taste all that they had. The tenders were normal tenders; the secret sauce helped them out. The coleslaw was not good. The fries were gross. The best part of the meal was the toast and lemonade.,0
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I took my first trip to Raising Cane's on Memorial Day! First the the young lady Kendall provided excellent customer service from a polite introduction to great service for all my needs. Second the quality of the food was great and was visibly hot and fresh. Overall I give my experience a 10/10 and recommend Raising Cane's not only for the great food but great service!,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,The customer service is top notch especially for a fast food joint.  I ordered the 3 piece chicken finger meal and it was good. The chicken is fried but greasy at all; on the inside the chicken is very moist and and tender not dry and overcooled like most chicken finger/ tenders.   The only downside the breading could use a little bit flavoring.  Overall the food was high quality and not to expensive; I would go back.,1

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Good food but nothing too special.  The sauce is pretty delish.  I have to say the customer service is def outstanding.  I would eat there again but it isn't something that I would be dying to eat.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"My family and I went here last night because my daughter wanted \chicky\"" and we were driving down Thomas so decided to give it a try.  Definetly NOT a place we will be dying to come back to.  They don't have any options other than how many pieces you want.  There are no flavor options for the chicken; they just come in plain flavor.  The texas toast they served wasn't very toasty at all and the fries were cold and un-seasoned.  Service was fast & friendly - 1 star.  The chicken tasted pretty darn good - another star.""",1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I love this place. It reminds me of Zaxby's from the South. Simple good food; dipped in tasty sauce.   I always like getting the Big Box meal so I can have the coleslaw; but I find the coleslaw tastes too salty for my liking. It's the one thing that makes me a little sad; but it won't stop me from enjoying everything else.  Service today was great; every single employee seemed to have great customer service skills; which was refreshing for a fast food joint.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"\Lowering Cane's expectations\"" should be the name.  They have just set the bar low on food quality and taste.  No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezer.  Must not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him.  Just drove away disappointed.  Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intake.  Only positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty clean.  Don't waste your time.""",0
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I will admit - Cane's sauce is what keeps me coming back! But at this particular location; it's the staff as well. They always deliver outstanding customer service; which is awesome because there are so many places that hire these young kids who are just brats. Whoever is the hiring manager - keep up the good work! And give your staff a pat on the back.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I usually get great service when I go here. It's been one of the things I've been impressed with because unlike most places they didn't seem to hire bratty teenagers; but that's exactly what I got last night. I pulled up; ordered and the girl at the window repeated everything back to me. When I pulled up to the window; another employee was screaming and playing around. I'm all for having fun; but not at the expense of service. The girl at the window was obviously distracted and handed me only one item I had ordered. When I told her I had ordered another meal; she got snotty with me. She gave me my other order; which still was missing my 4 extra canes sauces. When I again told her that I needed the sauces; she was incredibly rude; asked me to see my receipt and made a big deal about how she hadn't charged me for it even though she had repeated my order back to me at the speaker and definitely included the 4 sauces. She didn't end up charging me; but the whole thing was just ridiculous. I'm extremely disappointed with this whole experience.,0

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Service was GREAT; texas toast is awsome...the chicken was good but lacked seasoning and the sauce is not very good. Quality and service is good; they just need a little better chicken. I hope they adjust it and it will be FANTASTIC!,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"LOVE RAISING CANES!!! So delicious and your order is made fresh so it takes just a tiny bit but definitely worth the wait. You can also sub out the coleslaw for another piece of toast or more sauce! Also join their \Caniac Club\"" for free food!""",0
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,For specializing in chicken I felt it was lacking in flavor... There is no seasoning. Chicken was all white meat and very fresh but just like food you could make at home. They don't carry ranch for the chicken/fries only their famous canes sauce or honey mustard neither of which I like the taste of.. Reason for 3 stars was excellent customer service and very clean and well kept inside. ps my b-friend did like the canes sauce tho. Prob won't return... no real reason to.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I LOVE this place and can't get enough of it! From their chicken strips to their Texas Toast; to their amazing coleslaw; it's ALL good! Only drawback is it's a little more expensive price-wise for my liking but hey; it's an indulgence; or a treat; when I have it. Love their food; the ambience; and the friendly staff. Once when they forgot something to put my order they just moved me on back through the line so I could get my remaining parts to my order and get me off and running.   If you're looking for a new chicken place; give Raising Cane's a shot.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"I was surprised by this place.  When I first seen it; I was thinking it was just another fast food joint. When I had gone in side. I was like; \whit is this; it just have chicken fingers? What gives.\"" Then I ordered and; Wow.\"" The food was great. And I can see why specialising in one foid type; really makes a difference. Service was good; inside was clean and well decorated.  Though the price is a bit high.""",0

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"I like chicken fingers and have been watching this place go up. The place is brand new. There was plenty of parking. The service was efficient and friendly. But there is more to lunch than looks.  The 3 finger combo is just under $6.00 so even light eaters should bring a fat wallet. I was hungry and went for the 6 finger \Caniac Combo\"" for $8.30. My 11 year old son and I don't spend as much in a sit down restaurant as we did on today's fast food  lunch. There was plenty of food; unfortunately there is significantly more bad fries than average chicken. The chicken fingers are at best average and the sauce did not impress. Fortunately we had some Tobasco buffalo sauce to kick it up a notch. The fries are Ore-Ida without the crispy golden-brown outside or steamy inside.  The combo professes to include Texas Toast - mine did not. I took the time to call and let them know. They did not apologize; just asked me to hold. No longer friendly or efficient :(  Eventually they came back on the line and let my son (I had to get back to work) know they would take care of it next time. Neither of us knows what that means and we not likely to find out.""",0
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I had been told how amazing the food was; so I think I was slightly disappointed. However; it WAS good; just not life changing...but the thing that set this place apart was the service! I felt like I was in a sit-down restaurant. The cashier was very nice and personable; came to check on us; and it was extremely clean and well-decorated. It did not feel like a fast food joint.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I am not usually a fan of fast food; but I will give Raising Cane's a pretty solid score.  It is very clean inside and very attentative service.  A very limited menu offering but solid food.  The chicken is moist and succulent and the fries are the typical frozen fries.  You do have to wait a few minutes for your food though.  They are cooking it a la minute (to order).  I am pleased with these guys so I will go back!,1

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Maybe it's the 10 year old boy still in me but I LOVE chicken fingers! The thought of a restaurant dedicated solely to chicken fingers lead me to believe they MUST have perfected the art of amazing chicken fingers?  So I thought.  Went to the counter and was really surprised how small the menu is- it's tenders and a few sides; that's it!! Order the 3-tender basket which includes fries and some toast or bread. Asked for ranch STOP we only have our Cane Sauce. BUT I want ranch I exclaimed! We only have our Cane Sauce. and so on... Got my drink; by the time my drink was filled the guy from the counter was behind me with my basket in hand before I could even find a seat.   Fingers - so the chicken fingers themselves were breaded; moist and tender; not greasy at all; however I felt they could be a little more crisp... They were much smaller than the ones in the picture at the store and web site.  Fries - I don't normally eat fries. Don't get me wrong I like fries; I just avoid the carbs so If they were really good I would have eaten them. These were SOGGY; old-school crinkle cut fries!! The place sells chicken fingers and fries. WHY NOT MAKE AMAZING HOMEMADE FRIES? Why not do what the belgians do - cut 'em fresh; fry 'em TWICE (two different temperatures) and make them amazing? These were SOGGY. I would rather eat fries from Wendy's or even McDonalds.  Decore - Very nicely laid out; modern looking store. They spent some money on the place; it's evident.   BOTTOM LINE: If you are going to be a specialty store; you had better ROCK the few menu items you make. It'l be interesting if you are around in a few years.,0
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I would describe Raising Cane's as the chicken version of In-N-Out because they only sell one thing and that's chicken strips.  The restaurant is decorated with Movie memorabilia. It's kind of odd considering it has nothing to do with the food but I liked it. The employees genuinely seem happy to be there and are extremely helpful.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken finger sandwich with fries and a drink. The fries were great and I enjoyed my chicken sandwich. I don't know how to describe the taste of their house sauce but I like it a lot. I used it on my fries and my sandwich.   I had a good experience here. I think they need to jazz up the menu with more sauces and offer additional side items. I'll be back when I have a random craving for tasty chicken fingers!,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,This is for the new store in Tempe.  we have been eating at the Phx. store but very happy new the store in Tempe is open.  One of the employees in Nevada told us about the new store opening and it was great to see her her in TEMPE TRAINING THE NEW STAFF.   NATALIE from Vegas is just great.  The service is excellent and the food is consistent from store to store and very happy with that.  Management and staff at all locations come by on a regular basics and check if everything is ok or do we need anything.  Great Service for a fast food operation.  Keep up the good work; great food...

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,For a fast food place; this is 5 stars.  Excellent chicken fingers - juicy with a think breading.  Their Texas Toast is delicious too. Fries are average - but i am a sucker for a crinkle fry.   Service is always friendly and my order is right every time - which isn't always the case for fast food.  If you want delicious fast food this place is great.,1

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Raising Cane's is delicious and I always end up coming here a couple times whenever I am in town on business.  They are the only show in town now that my favorite - Rock N' Roll fingers has closed.  Their chicken strips are big and fried perfectly golden brown as are their fries.  Their signature dipping sauce is smooth and peppery and I always have to order an extra to go with my chicken and fries.  It is more or less exactly the same sauce they serve at Zaxby's chicken.  Fun decor and fast with your order.  If you love chicken strips; I recommend this place highly!,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Yummy chicken fingers; great sauce and friendly service!  I really like this chain that has only recently entered the Valley. The restaurants are nice and clean; decorated in fun style with movie posters and other pop culture memorabilia on the wall. Each restaurant also seems to support its local high school sports teams and many of the workers likely come from those schools.  Service has been very friendly; you order and they bring the food to your table. Going through the drive-through is very quick as well.  As for the food; they keep the menu simple: chicken fingers; fries; and Texas toast. The breading on the chicken fingers is tasty and I really love the special dipping sauce they provide - not sure how to describe the flavor except that its really good.  Overall; Raising Cane's is a great addition to the Valley's fast food scene.,1

w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Not bad; but not great.  Just standard chicken strips.  The service; however; was the best service I have had a a fast food establishment.  The staff was wonderful.  I would choose Cane's over another establishment because of the staff.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,First time at Canes for lunch today. They had 80s music blaring. With the linoleum floor; it was loud. The cashiers were very engaged in their work and did a good job.   Ordered for a crowd so I got the 25 piece tailgater with some fries and toast. It came with sauce.   Order arrived in 8 minutes which tells me it was not made fresh. Too bad.   The chicken was hot but lacked the crispness I was hoping for. I think most of it was cooked before I arrived. The fries were very limp. Not very appetizing. Most of them went uneaten.   Not impressed by Cane's but my coworkers keep raving about it so I'll give it another try someday. It just won't be a go-to.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Delicious!  My son is addicted to the chicken and Texas toast.  The service is always very pleasant and the food is always fresh and hot.  Very rarely have I had much of a wait in the drive thru line.  Definitely a crowd pleaser with the high school students in the area!,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Good chicken. I love their sauce!  Fast and friednly service too.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I liked this place so much I went two days in a row... :)  The staff was definitely friendly both visits. Saturday morning it was a little slower; but that just meant that I got extra attention from the staff.   The chicken was outstanding! And loved the Texas Toast that came with my order.   Welcome addition to our neighborhood. (I'm pretty sure my hubby goes through their Drive-Thru often.),1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,On the one hand; I don't think this place deserves the 2.5 star rating it currently holds but on the other; I can understand the disappointment..  We got the Box combo which is like 4 tenders; Texas toast; cole slaw; fries and drink.  I welcome this new kind of fast food restaurant in my neighborhood!  Its nice that you can get this kind of combo vs the traditional burger; fry; drink thing.  The prices are a tiny bit hefty - its just shy of Chipotle prices; I got this combo for roughly the price of a burrito.    That said; the tenders were pretty good!  Not overly breaded; fried right and not too greasy.  Not a huge fan of the Cane sauce - its not terrible but very negligible.  However; I do believe if you run a restaurant selling pretty much nothing but chicken tenders; you HAVE to offer more of a variety of sauces.  McDonald's offers 2 things - nuggets and tenders which comprise of what; 10% of the menu?  And they have like 10 sauces!  Anyway; more sauce options please!  The toast and the fries were slightly less done than I prefer.  The coleslaw was ok - not too exciting.  The service was GREAT; staff are pretty friendly - of course there were only 4 customers..  The atmosphere is fun and modern - random posters and pictures on the walls.  All in all; I'd like to see more sauces and a deeper fryer bath but I probably will get some more.  :),1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Very glad Cane's made their way to Arizona...it was one thing I missed about living in Las Vegas! It's not close to home; but always worth the drive for fresh; hot and delicious food and great service. The staff is friendly; the restaurant is clean and it is cheap comfort food.,1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"I just moved here from Las Vegas and though Phoenix basically has everything anyone could ever want; they didn't have Rasing Canes and I ate at my location back in Vegas every week for like three months before I moved preping myself to be without it. Well go figure they open a location just three miles from my new apartment the month I move to Phoenix! I feel so warm and fuzzy inside!  I love this place because the chicken is always super fresh; the fries pair perfectly with it and the big texas toast with \The Box\"" is just right. The caniac sause goes with everything on the plate and I usually need extra! I'm not sure why people ar bitchin so much about this place though; it's basically the In N' Out for chicken; they serve one thing and they do it well. I can never get enough of this place and I highly recomend it to anyone! They always have the best; most fun and friendly service and I just love the pellet ice; I sware it makes the drink taste so much better.   Try it for yourself  Phoenix; but try it with an open mind. Go inside; play along with the servers; enjoy the local flare hanging on the walls and read about the namesake dog Cane one and two. I love this place and I hope you can see why too!""",1
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"I had a late night craving for chicken and searched for a restaurant.  This was my first time at this diner. Both the parking lot and restaurant's interior were very clean.  I didn't check out the bathrooms. I was disappointed that this place only sells chicken fingers; very few sides and NO desserts.  .  what few choices were left; were also pricey.  I ordered the sandwich for my daughter and 3 chicken finger combo for myself.  While the chicken tasted like \real\"" chicken; it lacked the seasoning I'm used to and had more breading than meat for me.  The cole slaw was kinda off; but the fries were on da money.    Nevertheless; I won't be eating here again; as I was looking for chicken pieces not tenders.""",0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Short and sweet:  * terrible service * refuses to take coupons * seriously slow staff * good sandwich  Won't ever go back to this location; the service is simply too poor.,0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,This place is great; not cheap; but very tasty! Not at all like subway - ingredients are fresh and their hot sandwiches are the best!  My only complaint is the wait... if you plan on stopping by on your lunch hour be prepared to wait; and wait; and wait. The place is crowded and the line does not move very quickly. I went in to pick up a large phone order; figured I could walk up to the register; pay; and get out of there. My food was bagged up and ready to go; but I was told to get in line. I was there for 25 minutes!!!!! Needless to say; most of the sandwiches got soggy...  I've been here several times since this incident; and love it - like I said before; the food is great but the wait sucks :),0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,A little pricey and the service was not very fast but the red pepper relish is a real treat. Mostly sweat with a tart kick.,0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,"Met up with friends here for lunch.  They handled the lunch rush pretty well but nothing outstanding or unique.  I got an Italian on wheat bread.  The bread was soft and yummy; the very limited(variety-wise) toppings were fresh; but the sandwich seemed scant on the meats.  They were generous with the tomatoes and lettuce but the sandwich was still 80% bread.  I had it \Mike's way\""; which also included what seemed like a pint of oil and vinegar on each side.  The last few bites of my sandwich were soggy-yuck!  Price is high for what you get.  Easy parking and average service.  I'm still looking for a sandwich place with the quickness of Subway but the deliciousness of Cheba Hut.""",0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Service is pretty quick and workers are friendly.  They slice their meats and cheeses as they are making your sandwich.  I like the Turkey and Provolone and the bread is always fresh.  Make sure to sign up for their emails.  You will get a coupon for a free sub and drink on your birthday!,1
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Yo!  30 freakin' minutes from the time I walk in the door til' I'm draggin' my keester back out.  That don't sound half bad until you figure I didn't eat yet!  Yo!  I ain't yankin' your sausage either!  30 minutes through the line and waitin' for the freakin' food!  I called ahead and they said it would be faster to just come in!  How you like that?  Then I get back to the office and one of the freakin' sandwiches ain't even what I freakin' ordered!  You gotta be freakin' kiddin' me!  This was a one star review until the sandwich was pretty good; know what I'm sayin?  Hey; did you talk to da guy about dat thing?  You know dat thing I told you about?,0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Went in on Sunday; service was quick; friendly; and the food was great! Good alternative to subway.,1
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,"I was wondering around the complex trying to find a place to eat; when I found Jersey Mike's Subs in the corner of the strip-mall area. I was expecting a sub shop somewhat along the lines of one of their competitors in terms of price and taste. Unfortunately; neither price or taste compared to any of their competitors.  I waited 15+ minutes (I'll be a little lenient because it was lunch time); but the way the line grew; I was expecting something more since it seemed like a popular place to be. There were at least 20 customers in line and only 3 - 4 people working; at most... The guy who assembled the sandwiches needed a helper because it took him for-ev-er to get all the junk on the sandwich. But; I only gripe because I am very impatient. Especially during my lunch hour at work.  The price was ridiculous... $10 for a regular sub; chips and small drink. I ordered the club \Mike's Way\"" and took it back to work to eat. I got to work to try and eat the sub; which was a 5 minute drive away; and part of the sub was soggy from all the vinegar/oil that was on there. The other part of the bread was a little tough. The flavor? What flavor? It had bacon on it for God's sakes! It should have tasted like SOMETHING... nada... I mainly tasted the mound of vinegar that was on the thing.   Needless to say; I didn't feel this place will be worth a second visit.""",0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Food is good; but since they slice and then make each sandwich to order; be ready to wait.  If you're on a short lunch...go elsewhere  Wife ordered a steak sandwich with peppers; onions and mushrooms.  The combination made the sandwich like a bowl of soup.,0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Great service from the intial greeting at the door to the assembly of my sub to the cashier that rung me out. Pepsi fountain is clean and mixture of soda is perfect. Clean dining room.,1
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,This place has gone way down hill since it opened.  It has always been expensive but we still went there because the quality of the meat and bread were very good. They definitely seem to use better luncheon meat than most sandwich shops. When we first started going there we loved it except for the high prices; but now it is just a VERY poorly run restaurant with very low standards; poorly made sandwiches; and questionable hygiene. I know the management is terrible because the problems are so obvious and easy to fix but it just gets worse and worse. I have also talked to them on a number of occasions but they seem oblivious.  The first problem I noticed; a long time ago when the sandwiches were still good; was with the lettuce that they use. This one is really hard to understand. They have the worst lettuce I have seen anywhere. Why is it so difficult to have some decent lettuce? I had to start taking it off or not having it put on in the first place. The next problem that came up with the food was the bread that had previously been good; was now almost always stale; or at least nowhere as fresh as it had been before. On the last sandwich I had there the bread literally broke up into sawdust like crumbs. The problem here is no mystery and reflects very poorly on the management and employees. They now leave their bread out on the counter and exposed to open air all day! How can you be in this business and not understand bread goes stale quickly when left out in the open?  The service tends to be very poor; but to be fair; that's not exactly a rare occurrence in the food industry.  Finally; and this one may just be me because it doesn't seem like people are too concerned with this in restaurants anymore; the hygiene practices have become increasingly disturbing. Often I see the person cutting the meat not caring at all that the slicer is a mess. I worked in a deli when I was younger and I know it is no big deal to keep the slicer clean. The slicer is often just smeared with residue buildup from heavy use and they won't even take the time to clean it. The mess directly under the cutting blade gets bad enough that it will make you nauseous just looking at it. In addition to this there are a couple of other issues with hygiene. When they make the sandwich a lot of the employees have a habit of pressing your sandwich into the counter top and just sliding it to the right to the next stage of preparation instead of picking it up which should be no big deal. It's almost like they are cleaning the counter top with the bottom of your sandwich. The last thing I will say about this really bothers me. For some reason a lot of the employees actually remove the loose food debris that collects on the counter while making the sandwich; by using the sandwich cutter to push it into your sandwich after it is done. I really don't appreciate them cleaning the counter by using my sandwich as a garbage can for the scraps! Just put it into the garbage. I know a lot of people will say that it's just from making your sandwich but that is often not the case because they often scoop debris from other sandwiches that's been sitting there for a while into your sandwich. How does a manager see these kinds of thing and not do something about it?  It's sad because with some easy to make changes you have a good sandwich shop; but I guess they have a good location and don't feel they have to care about such things as long as people keep coming in.,0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Best peanut butter cookie I have ever had! Oh; and the subs and service are pretty awesome too. Always get great; friendly service.,1
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,I was down here doing some shopping today; and saw that there was a Jersey Mike's in this shopping complex; and I couldn't have been happier.  I spent the most of this morning running errands and getting some shopping done; and had worked up an appetite.  I was to hungry and tired to go home and fix something; so I cruised into Jersey Mike's for a sub.  The place itself is clean!  Nicely decorated; with ample amounts of seating.  They have a few tables outside; but I ate indoors since it was a brisk 95 degrees today.  I went with the #9; which is the club (I think.)  It came with Turkey; roast beef; cheese; and all the toppings.   The menu listed that it also came with bacon as well.  Well; when I ordered; I told the guy NO BACON.  He was fixing a few other subs at the same time; and as I was watching him; I saw him put a strip of bacon on what I thought was my sub.  He also forgot to add mustard as well.  When I got his attention; I asked him of the sub at the end was mine.  He said yes; and I requested that he remove the bacon; which he did.  He also added my mustard; thank goodness.  Anyways; I got chips and a drink with it; and all around; it was tasty.  Not a bad deal; really. I'm glad I went!  I also got a cookie too; free of charge.  The guy who was running the register handed out cookies to us; as I think it was time for him to rotate a few fresh ones in.  He kindly handed me a white chocolate chunk cookie; and boy; was it good.  YUM.  I really like Jersey Mike's; and would gladly return in the future.,0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,"I'm always in the mood for a good sandwich; so I stopped by Mike's.  As anxious as I was; I was STUNNED by the sky-high prices for what you get.  I mean; how good can a sandwich be to command 30% over market value; and 30% under volume consumed?    The bun was 70% of the presentation; and although the buns are worthy and important; they should be 20%.  The meat and cheese should be at least 50% of the value for the sandwich.  Any good consumer knows that.  Here we go; with no need to elaborate---  The outcome of the big 3:  Service:   This part was average; and it's what you would expect at a busy sandwich shop.  We were 3rd in line; and it was 7 minutes before we walked out the door.  Taste:  I liked the taste; although I was expecting SO MUCH MORE because of the hype that they put into their t.v. commercials.  After hearing the commercial; I expected them to be the most-perfect sub; just like they said.  The bun is 70% of the sub; and while soft and tasty; should've been 20% of the sub.    It was just O.K.; and it's fine for a quick bite at a sub shop.  Don't expect the meat and cheese to overpower the taste; since it's such a meager and marginal portion of the entire sub.  Price:  Welcome to the 'horrendous part' of the entire ordeal.  I have no problem paying $5 for a delicious sub.  One of the market leaders has been doing $5 subs for years; and I've often wondered why any other competitors that want to be market leaders haven't driven the price down AT ALL.  I expect that they don't want to compete in an American workplace; that is expected to be DRIVEN BY PRICE.  I would even give $10 for the most fantastic sub; like the ones that New Yorkers RAVE about the subs in New York.  Since this is a New Jersey import; I have HUGE problems paying $9 to walk out with an average sub + fixin's.  I'd have no problem unless; of course; Chandler had a average; upper-class wage compared to New Jersey's upper-class wage.  You'll notice that they are NOT the same; and you'll find that they are VASTLY different.  If this sub would've 'rocked my world'; then it's totally worth a $10 fee to escape with their fixin's.  As it was; I was left with a sub-standard sub (less than 12\) and with normal; wholesome; expected; and anti-climatic fixin's.  A big let-down from what their commercials INSIST are the best.  Summary: This shop is overpriced; and they don't get it.  They EXPECT that this is what you SHOULD pay for a 'premium' sub.  The trouble is; that Chandler is NOT Scottsdale; New York; nor New Jersey; and they haven't factored in the DESIRED sub shop that should be operating in a college community.  (we don't need more Scottsdale-type pricing; just college-kid pricing with college-kid type portions).    I doubt that the owners will agree; and also; please expect that the owners will maintain that they are \""...doing a good thing...\"" for the residents of the area.  Please disregard their fantasy leanings; since they don't understand the undergraduate population.  As far as stereotypes coming out of New Jersey; I'm also sure that these owners; just like the aggressive; post-WW2 unions; would ACTIVELY seek to prevent you from hearing what I've said about their food in this article.  I'm also convinced that they would also ADAMANTLY deny any affiliation with union henchmen.  Viva la America!""",0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,"As the name implies; this is a sub shop.  They have a variety of hot and cold subs; some traditional and some not-so-traditional.  You can get an Italian (cold cuts); meatball; Philly; and several more. So far all the ones I have tried are good.    They only have \white\"" or \""wheat\"" bread; compared to others who have four or more choices.  Their bread holds up better than Subway's bread (don't know why; but Subway bread seems to turn to mush pretty quickly).  They are pricier than Subway; but they are worth the difference.  And their staff was very friendly and helpful.  One thing you have to know is that after you pay you will probably have to wait about 5-10 minutes for them to bring the sandwich to you.  They make each one fresh; and custom to your order.  As near as I can tell they even slice the meat themselves after you place your order.  Unlike most places that have little bins of prepared ingredients.  So it does take a little longer.  They are popular enough that sometimes they do get busy; and the line can get long.  It's because lots of people seem to like their subs.  But it also means a longer wait if you hit them during a rush.  I try to time it a bit early (maybe 11:15 am); or a bit late (maybe 12:30-1pm).  If you try to go 11:30-12 you are likely to hit the lunch rush.""",1
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,One of my favorite sub places. Reminds me of home on the East Coast. Highley recommend. Staff is always friendly and gets the order right the first time.,1
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,I am going to give them a 3 and that is only because one of the stars is for service; their employees are friendly and personable. Sandwiches *2* mostly bread and soggy if you get it MIKES WAY! And just found out they give their employees 10-12 hrs a week...really!   GO TO FIREHOUSE SUBS!!! Try the ITALIAN; AWESOME!!!!,1
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,I love all Jersey Mikes; always. The subs are superior over all other chain sub shops. The guys at this specific shop are crazy nice and actually wanted to chat and offer great service. My sandwich is great every time I go here and thats what I love most about Jersey Mikes; the consistency. Any time I'm at the mall and find myself hungry; its worth the short ride across the street to get a sub from these guys.,0
CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,I had a coupon; I called in an order; it was ready when I asked. I was able to get extra jalapenos. Sandwiches were delicious.  A regular is  8 inches. i had t o wait a few minutes at the cashier because it was lunch time. He apologized for the wait which was not very long.    I will be back. It was yummy!,0
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,This is 1 of the best sub franchises out there right now. I ordered  the hero; medium size and for just under nine bucks for the drink it's a really nice sized sandwich. The toasted bread is delicious and the flavor combinations on the sandwich are yummy. Coming back soon because I noticed corned beef and pastrami with melted provolone after I already ordered my sandwich; I have to come back and try that,0
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,First off; since it is new; it wasn't in google maps yet.  That made it difficult to find when I couldn't remember where I had seen it before.  When I finally happened upon it; I was a little confused as to how exactly you order your sandwich.  My wife wanted an Italian; so that was easy enough; but I wanted a roast beef with cheese; lettuce; pickle; mayo; mustard.  As I told this to the order taker; I was a little dumbfounded that she just hit one button and looked like she was waiting for me to finish talking.  The cola machine was really nice; but there was only one; so it was a good 3-5 minute wait to pour a soft drink.  People just don't know how to use the touch screens efficiently yet.  When our subs came up I found out that they just put everything on mine (including tomato and onion which I can't stand); but I headed home with them anyway.  Come to find out that not only did my sandwich come out different than expected; my wife's had Mayo on it (which was not on the list of ingredients; was supposed to have Italian Dressing; not Mayo).  This was a problem since my wife doesn't like mayo or mustard.  I ordered the large sandwich; which was less substantial than a foot long at subway or sandwich from Jersey Mikes.  I was expecting it to be big enough to eat half now and the other later; but it was small enough to eat in one sitting.  Overall; it was a nice place and a unique concept; but very sub-par execution.  Some of the bugs will work themselves out; but the other flaws are probably permanent; so for about the same price I would prefer Jersey Mikes; Potbelly; Jimmy-John's; Capriotti's; etc.  Heck; even Subway.,0
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,Hyped up for Firehouse for years...this location finally opened in my location; and.....meeehhhhhh...  Service was friendly; but slow; considering how many folks they had behind the counter....luckily; I was able to catch my bus back home in time.   I was recommended to get a Meatball sub...the bread and cheese presentation was beautiful and delicious...the quality of the meatball and the sauce; in my honest opinion; tasted ALMOST EXACTLY like Subway. I like Subway's meatball sandwich; but after years of eating it; I know I'm getting a tasty; but subpar meatball sauce combo...I expected more authentic out of this place. The other premium hot sandwiches on the menu looked decent enough; so I will give them a try again before I would give up on them.  I really did like the hot sauce bar they had up front.....many; many different bottles and sample size containers (a la a Filiberto's type sauce container); so I took home 5 or 6 different types of sauces i've never tried to use on different stuff later and add to my Frankenstein bottle lol.  So yeah...first impression didn't quite live up to the hype; but it did show potential.,1
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,We were excited to see this new location when it first opened and decided to check them out. I'm a sucker for HOT SAUCES and they definitely have a large selection.  Inside is a little crazy and the seating area is a bit tight. Just order at the counter and wait for your sandwich to arrive. TICK TOCK!  Not sure how long it should take to make a sandwich. Actually I do know and twenty minutes seems longer than normal. How hard can it be?  Ordered the New York Steamer with some Elvis Burning Love hot sauce on my first visit and then a Large Italian with a side of Mango Habanero sauce on my second.  The sandwiches were good and pretty expensive. Even my wife thought it was a bit pricy and she is the queen of sandwiches.  Service was mediocre and it took longer than we expected. Maybe it was just this location or I'm just not that crazy about their sandwiches. The best part was the selection of Hot Sauces for me.  Give them a try and see what you think. I can make several sandwiches at home for the same price and everyone should know that Hot Sauce is my middle name. A-OK ALREADY!  2.75 STARS,0

iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,I was just introduced to Firehouse Subs and having been a fan of Potbellys and Subway; figured it would be essentially the same thing ..... WRONG.  I had their Turkey Verde sandwich and it was DELICIOUS.  For under 500 calories; I assumed I would still be hungry after and WRONG again.  I walked out completely stuffed.  Fresh ingredients; fast service; and helpful staff.  Next time someone wants to go to Subway or Potbelly's; I'll be taking them here instead :),1
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,I've been to the Gilbert AZ location many times and have always been satisfied.  Never a complaint.  I placed a group order (9 sandwiches) this past week for an office birthday lunch.    A few of them were not prepared according to our order which was disappointing; but the store owner promptly contacted me and offered to make it right.  He was very hospitable and clearly understands customer service.  Everyone makes a mistake now and then but the way that it was handled was first class.    The sandwiches are great and they cater as well!  If you have a larger order; call it in ahead would be my advice and ask them to clearly identify the special instructions on each sandwich.,1

iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,I like this brand not only for their food; as it is great; but I like the decor.  After 25 years in the Fire/EMS service; these locations bring back memories and fills the tummy with some great subs.,0
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,This sandwich just opened up right around the corner from me a few weeks ago.  So the other day I decided to try it.  It was an awesome experience!!!  I love the atmosphere of the whole firehouse theme!!  When you walk in on your left there are turnout coats hanging up and on the tops of the tables there is a Dalmatian print.  Behind the register there is an American flag made with the names of the people who died on 9/11.  The items on the menu had clever names to like the hook and latter or the engineer.  The sandwich I had was a ham sandwich on a white roll.  Very good!!!  The customer service was also very good.  They were friendly and when they call your name when your food is ready they bring it to you.  Now that's customer service at its best!!  If you have a small child they give them one of those red party fire fighter helmets!!!  I would highly recommend this place!!!!,1
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,Good place good sandwiches and food but it always seems like the staff just doesn't care about the customer and always dragging. It's not going to keep me from eating at firehouse subs but I prefer other locations far more than this one. The girl at the counter just took my money and walked away. Stood there with my punch card for a min; to get my punch and some else finally said something to me as the others just chit chatted behind the sandwich bar.  Sorry if sandwiches and service is too ruff!,0
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,first time ordering from this place we had seen a lot of adds for them on tv  we decided to order online very easy to use finished 3 sandwich orders in minutes. went to the store to pick up order I was greeted as soon as I walked in told them I ordered online they said no prob your food is ready and brought it out to me. we opened the sandwiches they looked great; smelled great I had the sweet and spicy meetball it didn't taste anything like subway (don't know what that guy is talking about) it was great the meatballs were moist and flavorful and the sauce was spicy but not super hot spicy just a little bite my guys got the steak sub they said they were great too will be eating there again its a bit of a drive we can do that once a week thxs for the great food,1
iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,**Beware:  If you are one of the few people with a cheese allergy; DO NOT GO HERE**  They will put cheese on your sub whether you like it or not.  I do not give 1-star reviews often.  Below is the reason I think this place needs corporate management ASAP: I want to start by saying I have visited multiple Firehouse Subs locations; and I have always been impressed with the service and product received.  Since I love Firehouse Subs; I was excited when the Tatum location was opening up.  My husband and I went for lunch within the first couple of weeks of it opening; and it was an awful experience.  Firstly; the manager shouting out things at the employees very loudly).  Secondly; I received a wrong order TWICE due to my lactose intolerance issues (received with cheese and then mayo).  Thirdly; I being somewhat accused of trying to steal sandwiches by the person who put together the sandiwch; since I had to go to the counter to explain my very difficult(?) order to him. Since my husband had waited and waited to eat his sandwich because of my bad orders; the guy thought we had kept a sandwich.    Anyway; we just decided it was a new place that was super busy; so we would try again.  Today; I decided to go back.  It was not busy; but the most tables were taken.  I had a to-go order and specifically told the cashier that I did not want cheese or mayo on my order.  I asked him to put it in big; bold letters!   While waiting for my order; the manager (I think he's the manager) was once again talking to employees way too loud.  He was upset that they weren't greeting everyone when they walked in.  In my personal opinion; he should worry less about greeting every customer and more about QUALITY CONTROL.  I received my sandwich and left.  Later; when I got home; open the wrapper and there it is CHEESE; again.  Once is a mistake; twice is a habit.  Part of the larger issue; is how long a person who is lactose intolerant has to wait to get the other sandwich.  In my opinion; corporate should go there to adjust and fix things.  Although I will still support Firehouse Subs; I will not be going there too often; because that location is the closest to my house. Bottomline: I will not return to a place that is inconsiderate of sandwich changes & to hear a manager talk to his staff openly and loudly.,0

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Wow; this In-N-Out was packed to the gills on Friday night! Despite it being so busy; there wasn't any wait to place our order; and there were still seats left for us to enjoy our meal. Even though they were slammed with orders; we still got service with a smile. Our order didn't take too long to get made; and soon we were enjoying our cheap yet tasty burgers.  I decided to go out on a limb and try something completely foreign to me in the realm of burgers- protein style (Substitute wrapped lettuce for bun)! I had it with cheese; and also animal-style. I shared some fries; well-done (i.e.; they are fried twice instead of once); and a fountain drink.  The burger with no bun and lettuce wrapping was quite good. the crisp; fresh lettuce was a good complement to the hot grilled burger patty and condiments. Despite it being wrapped in the requisite paper pouch; it was still a messy meal as the lettuce does not soak up any of the grease and sauce like a regular bun will; so as I ate more; the paper got soggy and juices started to run down my hand and arm. While I really enjoyed the burger protein-style; I think a single patty just isn't enough for me; since I was still a bit hungry after chowing down so next time I will try it double-double!  The fries; when \well-done\""; are a whole lot better than their regular style. Frying them twice made them quite crispy; and the extra frying adds more flavor to the potatoes. I do appreciate that they use freshly cut potatoes though!  They are open late at this location- Until 1:30 A.M. on the weekends and up to 1 A.M. other nights.   Overall; a good way to start the end of your work week right!""",1

If you don't like fast food hamburgers; then why the heck are you going to this place to begin with!??? Sheesh.  The quality and service at In-N-Out are always consistent. The ground beef is of average to above average quality; and they will cook your fries extra toasty if you want them to. They always get your order right... What's not to like?

I typically order the double-double w/o the (thousand islands sauce) and onion (this saves not only by breathe; but about 200 calories); and have them add ketchup and mustard. I do have to say the fries are just ok (5 Guys' are much better; but then they are 1400 calories for the large; so I'll eat these ones and be happy my waist is not expanding).

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Just go here.....plain and simple..... if you like burgers. Anytime I can try an In & Out when I travel I usually do; and they are all great. Being from the East Coast; we didn't have I & O; so I cherish this place; and am excited to have 2 in the area. From a health standpoint; the food is fresh; but I wouldn't say this is something you should partake in everyday. The fries are made fresh for every order; and the burgers have this special sauce that is just oh so good. It is perfect for a late night binge after going out; be prepared to wait  in line; at almost anytime at both the  drive-thru or inside; both move quick; but your looking at a 5 to 10 minute wait time. I heard they have a secret menu; where you can order a veggie burger of sorts; plus other things off menu.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I support  the idea that in-n-out is a great fast food restaurant for several reasons. First; in my opinion; in-n-out has a great quality of food. For example; the meat is prepared fresh everyday; so it will taste delicious. Also; French fries are prepared well everyday and it's the most fresh French fries I have ever eat. Second; I think the quality of service at in-n-out is high. For instance; the workers there are friendly. Finally; in my point of view; the price of range is low for a student. For example; all social classes can eat from it. In conclusion; I advice everybody to try it and I hope you like it.,1

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,My husband's former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person; we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasn't working.  There was no line out the door; who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato; no special sauce; no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay; but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husband's had a big slice of tomato.   Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly; but it came pretty close.,0

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"I don't eat very much fast food.  I tend to cook at home most nights.  When I'm in a state that has In-N-Out Burger; though; I make an exception.  Truth be told; I've never thought of In-N-Out Burger as fast food.  It is true diner quality -- which is a compliment.  I'm talking about the diners of yesteryear.  When diner food was like home cooking; but with a much bigger grill!  I've been to a number of In-N-Out Burger's in my day.  Something I appreciate at each location is just how much the staff seems to enjoy their job.  Now; I don't have much fast food experience.  I don't know what it's like at one of the big chains; like McDonald's or Burger King -- but I've heard from friends who have worked at one of those places that it is a fairly thankless job.  I've never met a person; sans an owner of a McDonald's franchise; who said they loved to work for the golden arches.  But; people who work for In-N-Out Burger are always so...jovial.  It's actually quite jarring.    This location is no exception.  It opened at 1030AM.  We were there at 10AM because we were driving into town and figured it would be easier to wait than to drive back at a later time.  At 10AM; they were already helping customers and making orders.  Why? Because they had a line of people and cars that was there before we arrived at 10AM and they want to make their customers happy.  A simple philosophy that seems to be too often forgotten these days.  Of course; everyone seems to know about the secret menu; so I won't explain my order to anyone.  We got:  Double Double  Animal Style - it was exactly what we hoped it would be.  Flavorful; juicy; well-cooked and delicious!  These burgers really stand the test of time; as well; due to a wonderfully sweet and decently dense bun.  Fries Well-Done Animal Style - These fries are a gift from whatever god you believe in. Secret sauce; grilled onions; cheese and deliciously crisp fries make for a mouth-watering experience.  All in all; a great location that went above and beyond to take care of its customers.    As an aside; for us; 1030AM equated to 1230PM since we live in Texas and had just driven into town.  Watching all these college kids eat burgers and fries for breakfast -- well; I wept for my love of pancakes and bacon.  Another aside; most In-N-Out Burger locations still don't know the \On the Sal\"" secret menu item.  It's a side salad with secret sauce (a bit like thousand island but better).  So; order it whenever possible!  :D""",1

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I love In-N-Out; but this is the first time I've got to give them only 3 Stars.

The Animal Fries on the other hand were terrible....they were cold and chewy.  Unbelievable; because they cook it fresh....they must've left this order on the counter while they finished by Burger instead of giving me a fresh order of Animal Fries.  It was a little disappointing because I normally have a 4 or 5 Star experience at an In-N-Out.  Oh well; maybe I caught them on a bad day?    Return Factor - 60%,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,The place was packed around lunch time; which can be expected.  So I sat outside in 109 deg weather (which locals are used to; it's a litle warm for a Yankee); and started to roast and didn't even realize the metal table and bench were piping hot and leaving burn marks....Because when  you have a plate with an animal style double double in front of you; there's just nothing else in the world that matters.  I miss you already In-n-out.  Small request; and I don't mean to knit pick.  please learn how to make french fries.  I  know you do it naturally and such; but let's get it together guys..in 2013; a plate of fries that doesn't have a week's worth of salt in them shouldn't be considered a culinary breakthrough.  That said; I forgive you because  your cheeseburgers make me so happy.  Also; service is very friendly and fast.  Def give them credit for navigating the chaos and still being nice about it..,1

In 04 I moved east and every time I'm near an InO; I have to stop!    I got off the plane yesterday and asked the rental car lady how to get to the closest one.  I'd been once before but couldn't remember the directions.  My partner and I jumped in the car and zoomed over.  We were on a mission.  As soon as I walked in and smelled the burger grease; I knew I was home.  I showed some restraint in only ordering the cheeseburger combo (I normally get the double double).  I inhaled my food and left.    I'm plotting as to which day I'll be returning this week--and I will get that double double.    YUM!,0

When I got my food it looked absolutely delicious; but when you bite in to the burger; there is no flavor there to savor. The burger was very bland even with all the toppings that come on it. It was very disappointing. The fries were the same way and I understand they are fried in cholesterol free oil; but when you bite in to them there was no crisp about them; they were soft and chewy.

So lets dispense with the silliness; this place is what it is; it's cheap; surprisingly cheap; fast... usually VERY fast (unless there's a hella rush) Service so friendly that it's almost scary!   As for the food; the meat is decent quality for a chain and fresh; not frozen. tasteless lettuce fresh and crispy for texture; and onions either grilled or fresh cut; your choice. Now to what I tend to order... yeah they have a secret menu; and I've played with it a bit; but I only tend to go when tired and haven't planned in advance; and since I don't care enough to memorize the secret menu; all i know is \animal style\"" which isn't bad at all; adds a bit of flavor and messiness to the burger; although I only had it the once. The buns are fresh; as are the fries; so i find that they benefit from extra toasting; order them both \""well done\"" I find that especially for the fries; it makes a world of difference. The well done fries are much better than the usual ones.More texture and crunch etc... As for the burger; i like fresh onions; so add lots of those; and they have never let me down.   To the people that view the animal style fries as gross because of the way they \""look'? So what? How do they taste? and if it just wasnt for you; then fine; but I have never had them myself; and cant imagine I would ever order them because they looked good (or good for you!) I mean figure out the ingredients; art for the eyes was never the point! I want to try the animal fries myself; i just haven't.   If my fast options are Chick-Fi-Lay/Panda Garden/In-N-Out/Hardee's (Carl's JR out here)I would probably go for one of the burger joints; with the awareness that the entire meal at In-N-Out would cost what the burger at Carl's costs; but sometimes I don't go for cheap; and some Carls are decent.)

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,What is ever bad about In N Out? Typical spot; same decor as any other. Quick; friendly service with delicious burgers and frys. Milkshakes are outstanding and you have to get extra spread for the fries (it's free just ask). Parking gets a little crazy and the bathrooms are always to small; but I can easily overlook that once I get my food.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,My usual orders; 1 hamburger with grilled onions; 2 fries; and 1 cup of water.  Totally love their fresh cut fries; all food here have never been frozen and it's fresh daily.  Love their fast services; however; you might have to wait a bit longer during lunch time and afternoon rush hours.  But it's totally worth the wait.  They also have a secret menu food that you'll have to ask them to make for you.  Try it out!,0

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Wow! What a line! I now its good; but wow! They are working hard to get all those orders out. Check In 7:08PM. Order 7:12PM; food in hand 7:21pm. That's pretty good for the massive rush they had.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Please...no matter whatever the location; the service is always friendly.  Burgers and shakes are very solid.  The burger is a little better when it is done animal style.  I usually alternate between strawberry and chocolate flavors for my shakes.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"FOOD: This place is the epitome of quality over quantity in terms of its menu. The only choices are burgers; fries; and shakes. The fries are soo good! Burgers are also amazing for a fast food chain. Shakes are mediocre and I wouldn't recommend getting them. In-N-Out's menu may look basic; but there are some hidden items on the menu. For example; get the Animal Style Fries and you can have that as a whole meal. The fries are covered in cheese; thousand island dressing; and onions. They are good but very heavy. You can get as many patties and slices of cheese as you want. Ask for a \4 by 4\"" and you will get 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese on your burger. You can even ask them to make your fries crispy if you like them that way.   PRICE: Best value in town! Burger; fries; and soft drink will cost less than $6. The low price and great food keep you coming back.   ATMOSPHERE: Typical fast food joint; nothing special. It can get quite busy in there though.   SERVICE: I think In-N-Out employees are really Carebears in human costumes. They are so polite and very helpful.   SKINNY: You don't know what you're missing! One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life; and the best deal in town for a good meal.""",1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I've been a fan since I lived in L.A. It's a good thing it's in the opposite direction from work to home or it would become an addiction. I love the animal style or when I'm feeling good the protein style burgers. I like the way they make their fries and when I'm feeling really bad I order my fries animal style. I've never met a worker there that didn't look like they were enjoying their job. They all have great attitudes.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Their food is always amazing. Where else can you get a grilled cheese? They have yet to get my order wrong; and their attitude is always pleasant.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,No need for a long review.  Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.  Great Food Great Customer Service  Love this place,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Of fast food burger joints few places are as well known in areas where they have absolutely no store presence as the chain \In-N-Out Burger\"". While visiting Arizona on a business trip I was aware In-N-Out Burger was a fixture in the area; and it had been well over a decade since the last time I had stopped at one.   Since my first pair of visits to In-N-Out Burgers in California in the early 2000s; I've seen people wearing In-N-Out Burger shirts; read countless articles about the chain; and decided the next time I'm near one I'll give it another shot. My feeling in previous visits to In-N-Out was that while good; and inexpensive there was nothing exceptional about the food there. Would I notice something I didn't before?  When I arrived at my hotel in Tempe Arizona I was immediately able to spot an In-N-Out location and visited several times during my two week stay. On my initial visit I ordered a 3x3 which is three beef patties and three slices of cheese served \""Animal style\"" which is with lettuce; tomato; the beef patties being mustard cooked; pickle; extra Thousand Island style sauce known as \""spread\"" with grilled onions. I also got Lemonade and animal style fries which added spread and onions to the top of my fries. Overall; I thought the burger was very good; especially for the price; but that even with the spread the fries were a bit lacking.   My next visit I went in a slightly different direction; passed on getting any fries and just got a regular 3x3 burger without the animal style additions and a chocolate shake. I noticed that besides the lettuce; tomato and onions it didn't taste as different as I thought it would. I also obtained this through the drive-thru and was given a box rather than a bag; making it somewhat difficult to transport without spilling. The shake I had was excellent; and while I was in the area I tried vanilla;chocolate and strawberry shakes and all were good.  My overall opinion of In-N-Out is this; if you've never visited one it isn't the legendary once in a lifetime experience you may have heard about. However; it is very good for fast food and is quite inexpensive. The most unique characteristic of getting an animal style In-N-Out burger is that it is unique tasting. Nothing exactly tastes quite like an In-N-Out burger; the sharp onions and more sour than big mac sauce thousand island spread give the burger its character. It might not be the best tasting fast food burger ever; but it has its own identity. I am going to give In-N-Out four stars.""",0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,5 stars. Nothing else needed. If you haven't eaten In-N-Out yet and you are currently in AZ... if you're not a vegetarian.... are you from Mars?  Get in here and order a #3 right now.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,If you are reading a review on In-N-Out...I am slightly worried that you have been living in some sort of underground shelter for way too long. Then again; you may just be looking to see what items to order to shake up your current order. So here's my favorite: grilled cheese...yes; they make grilled cheese at In-N-Out and they are oh-so-good! If you order just a grilled cheese it will come exactly like the cheeseburger minus the meat; they throw on all the same toppings. You can also order a grilled cheese-plain. This will be the toasted buns with a cheesy center of wow! I like to get one of each; one plain; and one regular minus the sauce and sub regular onions for grilled onions- so in a sense; animal style minus the sauce. :-) I also like their fries. I will get them animal style minus the sauce. You end up with a box of fries with melted cheese and grilled onions. So good! And the bottom half usually doesn't have toppings so you also get some plain fries. Wash it all down with a coke! All American Yumminess!,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,If you are in the mood for a fast fresh prepared as you order burger this is the place to go.  I recomend doing a google seach and looking at their 'secret' menu that list multiple different options and variations ontheir food.  I am a huge fan of the mustard grilled cheeseburger.  Fries are delish.  This isn't gourmet but they dont pretend to be.  The decor is 50-60'2 style throwback drive in.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Arguably; the best burger place in the world.  The only other burger place that enters the argument is Five Guys.  When I stayed in Tempe; In and Out was my best friend.  Definitely; the best fries out there.  The custom orders take on a life of their own.  The service is uniquely friendly for a fast food place.  And; yeah; they stick to the main criteria of a fast food restaurant...FAST!,1

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Times have changed. Unfortunately; I am no longer a Sun Devil. I am not in between classes and certainly don't look the age of a college student. Therefore; I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb at this particular location. Do I care? Nope. In-N-Out is good no matter what college campus it is on :) As with most of their locations; GREAT customer service and a fantastic product. Nothing like a grilled cheese (animal style) to make you feel a bit better about life.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I love you guys!!  Quick and friendly service no matter if I'm in LA; Daygo; Phoenix or Vegas!  Burgers are always scrumptious! Cheap eats too.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I don't eat any other burgers except In-N-Out and 5 Guys...and honestly; I don't even eat fast food except for those two places (sometimes I cheat by getting tots from Sonic...but rarely).  When it comes down to it; how can you subject your self to the frozen patties of other places and the low quality; yellow french fries that are oh-so-common.  I just won't stand for it...it is not worth it to me.  Go to In-N-Out burger or just don't eat fastfood.  It's pretty simple.  My standard order: # 3; Animal Style...pink lemonade with Sprite/7-Up.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Writing this review around lunch time and its making my mouth water and day dream of more In-N-Out! The menu is simple burger; fries; and shakes. No crazy combos or an endless list to chose from.  Except for you can add the secret menu into the mix.  Im from Texas where sadly there is no In-N-Out and even I know of the delicious secret menu! I always order my fries animal style!  Honestly; I wouldn't eat the fries if they weren't animal style; only because their fries are not super crispy like I usually like my fries.   With that being said; all there food is amazing and its all made fresh.    Yes; this location does tend to get busy; but they keep the line moving surprisingly really fast. No worries... In-N-Out will be in your tummy soon!,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"In and out is pretty simple; fast; and cheap for a pretty good burger. The people who work there are all very nice and the food is pretty good for fast food. For me it was hyped up way too much before I went so my experience might have been a little bit of a letdown; however the burger I got was pretty good and tasted fresh. ***make sure when you order the fries to ask for them \crispy\"" or else they come out pretty soggy and do not taste that good at all. Also you might want to check out the \""not so secret\"" menu online and look at other options you have when ordering. Please don't forget this place is a Fast Food joint so don't expect a gourmet burger; just an affordable burger that might be a slight step above some other fast food joints. Oh and the menu has only a few options (no chicken sandwiches just burgers and cheeseburgers as well as fries and shakes).""",1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation; so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!  The menu is as simple as it gets - burger; cheeseburger; fries; drinks.  But don't let that fool you; there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties; the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet; but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that; you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun); or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.  French fries can also be ordered animal style; but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes; you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla; chocolate; and strawberry.  It's that simple; yet that perfect.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"I love in-n-out but this is one of their busier stores that I have been to! The food was good but service wasn't exactly \in-n-out\"".""",0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,It's pretty much a given that In-N-Out is amazing and if you don't like it; then there is something very wrong with you. So this rating is for the service. This is probably the busiest location; but the food comes out pretty quick considering all the people. I didn't realize how great the service was here until I went to an empty In-N-Out in North Scottsdale and my food took forever. Oh and quick tips; my favs are a neapolitan shake and animal fries; YUM!,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Love this food! Service is amazing. Everyone is always in a good mood!!! Animal fríes are always so perfect.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Its cheap; greasy and fast.... I don't understand the rage that makes it so popular. The burger seemed so ordinary; and the fries were good but nothing to write home about. I ordered a double cheese \animal style\"" and it was fine. It was fast and affordable but unmemorable. I just don't get it. Its not as if I don't like the place; but my sales manager about pissed his pants when we spotted the restaurant. If he is happy; I'm happy.""",0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Their burgers are great but I've never been one to go out of my way for one. I get the double double with cheese protein AND animal style. YUM! Now; I normally wouldn't review a chain like this but I was so impressed the last time we went I had to share. There was 5 of us; all ordering something just SLIGHTLY different than anyone else; all different drinks and sizes; some combo meals some just the burger; some protein style others just animal or (like mine) both. It was a Thursday and the line was long. LONG. I mean like really lllllllllllooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg. It was almost as long as when the chain first came to AZ. But they kept it moving quickly and got our order PERFECT. I just wish they'd do something about their fries already!,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Having moved out of California and in to Houston; TX; I absolutely missed In-N-Out - the only fast food I'll ever cave for.  In-N-Outs are pretty consistent across the board; but I was a bit disappointed with this location; hence the -1 star.   My go-to order forever?: 1 cheeseburger; grilled onions; chopped chilies; medium rare. The guy at the counter told me they don't do medium rare...  Um... \...\""  I don't see why they won't (or wouldn't); but I just said \""Ok\"" and went about my day. While it temporarily filled the hole in my heart where In-N-Out goes; it was merely satisfactory; not outstanding (so yes; on your elementary-school-like report card; In-N-Out of Tempe; you get an \""S\""; not an \""O\"").  As a side note; give this a try; and see if they're willing to go along with what you want: http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/03/the-in-n-out-survival-guide-we-ate-every-single-item-on-the-secret-menu.html.""",0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,As someone who came out to ASU from the Midwest; I have to admit that one of my favorite things in Tempe is the In N Out by the 202.  Before I came out here; everyone I had talked to from the West Coast raved about In N Out burger and they hype is well deserved.    In N Out is fast food; but its the most fresh and flavorful burger I have ever had; and for some reason; even the bun tastes better than at most places.  And for anyone totally new to the place; order Animal Style on your burger; you'll definitely be glad you did.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"I just don't get it! The burgers are empty with barely any taste; the fries are always cold and leave a disgusting greasy film in my mouth; and the grilled onions taste like slimy slugs.  I want to like this place; I really do. I'm forced to eat it at least once every six months because every single person I know loves it and acts like it's Gods gift to fast food. (hence the psalms on the cups) This place is like fast food for elitists. \I won't step foot into a McDonalds but In&Out is so indie and different that I'll allow them to serve me~\""  The hidden menu is what really gets me. Having \""secret items\"" on your menu doesn't make you cool. It doesn't make your customers feel special or exclusive (unless they're idiots). It just makes me feel like you're too cheap to update the menu that you've had since the dawn of time.  Did I mention that there is ALWAYS a giant line? Both in the drive through and the dine in. Theres never a good place to sit and it's always packed. If I didn't know any better I'd think it was Club In&Out.  That being said; when I'm forced to eat it I'm unhappy but never physically ill like I am with another extremely popular place that I hate (chipotle). Also the employees are really friendly and service is pretty quick considering how long the lines always are.   I know I'll most likely continue going here with people close to me for the rest of my life but I would never pick it on my own or suggest it to outsiders.""",1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,This is one of my favorite burger joints because they re the most consistent with great tasting burgers and fries!   No matter where I go; I always find myself comparing their burger to In-N-Out.  This particular location is a frequent stop for me and my friends.  The service is awesome and friendly! There burgers are delish and they really fast.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,This place is a gem!   I adore everything on their menu but really love their fries with melted cheese on top and the single cheese burger. Nothing. Better!   Plus the service is great and it's always consistent! Lovvvee.,1

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I'm tempted to take off a star for the pricing at In-N-Out Burger as I find their prices to be slightly above what I consider fair for an amazing burger. But since their burgers are great--I will keep them at 5 stars. This location; like many of their locations; is usually very busy. However; considering that they are right down the street from ASU (where everyone loves them) I think their level of busyness is understandable. I've never had to wait more than 7-10 minutes at this location and I usually have a special order and visit during peak times. Besides the fact that their burgers taste amazing (ask practically anyone; they'll say the same thing) I love how fresh everything there is--if it goes into your food it is fresh and never frozen. I also like the fact that In-N-Out Burger pays their workers well; it is refreshing to see a company treat their workers with dignity and respect.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"In-N-Out How I love thee!!! As someone who's been living in phoenix for a few years; I must say this Californian burger is adored !!  Its a staple; its simple; no frills- a classic hamburger with fries. And a milkshake if you have enough room for it :) Everything is fresh (more or less)- I adore the hand sliced fries. I find myself easily amused in the drive through watching them annihilate one potato after the other in vats of hot bubbly oil.... mmmmm I usually get their cheeseburger with onion- always HITS the spot.  They have a \Secret\"" or formerly secret menu this animal style! Lets just say you must have quite an appetite with the extra sauce cheese and fried onions. On fries its amazing; but be prepared to pop a pant button or two :) Service is always spot on-  I think this place has been very well received and reviewed.

I was just at in n out last weekend with a friend and stuffed my face with glorious greasy in n out burger and animal styled fries.... mmm artery clogging deliciousness. I love this place. Its timeless; you go back after a week; a month; a year; the quality is still spot on; you get exactly what you ordered- and that is what makes this place what it is.  I cant wait to come back.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,It's what a hamburger's all about.  Ever smoke crack? I have. While eating a Double Double off the a$$ of a stripper.  Just like Doogie Howser in Harold & Kumar.  Except it was a Double Double with grilled onions ; not a big fat line of coke.  I was able to kick the crack. Still working on the strippers.  I will never be able to quit In N Out.   Remember to order a chocolate shake.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Typically; I would shy away from writing a review on a fast food chain with 290 locations. However; the In-N-Out experience is anything but the normal fast food dining experience. I am always impressed by the consistency of the In-N-Out Burger experience.   The quality of their never frozen beef patties and fresh; made-to-order burgers is excellent and their customer service is always prompt; efficient; and wonderful. The staff is always courteous and happy--it's good to know that I am supporting a place that seems to treat their employees well.   The inexpensive burgers and fries always hit the spot--I only wish there were locations outside of California and the Southwest to satisfy my fast food burger cravings. But; I suppose staying within a manageable driving distance of the distribution centers is what keeps the food high-quality; fresh; and preservative-free.

When I want to try a variation on my favorite; I just consult the \Not-So-Secret\"" menu on the In-N-Out website!   If you have not been to an In-N-Out burger; I strongly recommend visiting this wonderful fast food place!

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I drove all over town because I was lost. I thought I knew Tempe. You would think I could use Siri or my map on my phone.  No I guess I am stubborn.  Anyway I did find it but it was not easy to get into the area so I had to drive around again until there it was right in front of me.  Finally I ordered a burger;fries and a diet coke.  I was content and could try and find my way back to Chandler.  Well once again I used my keen senses to find my way back.  I was so happy to be home.    I am glad I live where there is no In-N-Out but if there was one around home I think I would seek it out here and there.  I love burgers but I really am crazy for their fries.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Protein style well-done.....going; going; gone! Every time it's the same for me.....the grilled onions are a MUST! Just recently; I added the indulgence of Animal-style fries to the order. I'll never go without again! As for the chain; I know what to expect and am never disappointed. As for this location; I was greeted with a smile; given prompt service; and found a nice clean booth to have one of my favorite fast-food  lunches when visiting AZ.,1

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,By far the best burger for the buck!  My 3 kids and I grind here regularly for a little over $20.  And I've got two teenagers! God help me.  So it's not gonna appear on  any diets but so what?  Order an animal style; some fries and a chocolate shake and invite me!!,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,In-N-Out was on my list of west coast fast food joints to check out on my trip.  I don't even eat hamburgers; but I liked it.  First; I LOVED the limited menu.  I hate when you give to many options to people; and they take forever.  My friends liked their burgers; so I'm guessing its good.    I ordered the fries; and they were probably the only fries I ever had that tasted like potatoes.  I really liked them; and the odd but normal taste of potatoes was good.    The place was swamped; but everyone had their orders in a couple minutes.  Bonus points for the counter boy who brought me my fries with a smile.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I have been to this chain 25 times? 1/2 or more to this location. Every location is busy. People always pleasant and accomodating. Price reasonable. I like the fries but have not gotten them when hot a single time. If hot; even most of the time; 5 stars would be in order.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Looking for simple then it's all about In-N-Out. Service is always good and quick. Got a double-double with some animal style fries and it was pretty satisfying.,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"After hearing about In-N-Out Burger for years; I finally was able to try it while on a trip to Phoenix.  Menu.  I walked inside and was immediately impressed with the simple menu: hamburger; cheeseburger; double-cheeseburger; fries; milkshakes; soda.  This is a burger restaurant; so why should they clog the menu with lots of other things--if I wanted to eat chicken or fish; I'd go to a place that specializes in those foods.  The simple menu made it really quick to decide what I wanted to eat.  Service.  The counterperson acted like a genuine human being--not the typical; fast-food robot.  From this point on; the word \genuine\"" repeatedly came to mind.  Food.  The cheeseburger was very good; but not exceptional.  I was pleased to read that the patty was not frozen; as would be expected.  The fries--which they said were freshly hand made--were exceptional.  I can't ever remember having fries that tasted this good anywhere--really crispy.  The chocolate shake was very smooth--also made from genuine ice cream instead of some powdered box mix.  It was definitely better than any other fast food milkshake I've tried.  Restaurant:  The restaurant was cleaner than most fast-food places as was the bathroom.  Overall:  I would certainly be happy to eat at In-N-Out Burger again.""",1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Of course I feel like a freak being one of the few people to give this place less than 4 stars; however; I just don't see what the big deal is. Limited menu is some how elitist? What? Since when is that fashionable? What am I not seeing here? Apparently there is special lingo; and \in the loop\"" type service. How is that a good business practice and how can people play into this charade willingly? I just don't get it.  Bad; dry burgers; limp fries; limited menu; and hipster air. And I've been to different In-N-Out Burgers; all the same. Don't get it; I don't recommend.""",0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"In the word's of Spongebob Square Pants; \I'M READY!\"" After ten months of more Mcdonald's than I've probably eaten in the past ten years; I'm ready to leave Australia and return to my home country; the meca of fast food.   Though; I am an avid fan of the New American cuisine (vegan friendly & fair trade) I WANT SOME MEAT. I've made a list of all the fast food spots I plan on hitting up upon arrival back to the states.   This list reads as follows:   1. In N Out 2. Whataburger 3. Wendy's 4. Taco Bell   As you can see; In N Out's my number one and this is simply because it's the best. It's funny to see that Mickey D's isn't even on the list when I shamefully admit that my roommates and I eat there maybe once or twice a week.. gross; I know.   Last night over a double hamburger; fries; and a sundae all for 9 dollars; I began explaining In N Out to my house mate. In N Out isn't a place you go for just anything; most people know exactly what they like and order just that; time and time again.   Though the menu is small and simple the big tastes explain it all. The patty's aren't large in any way but the fresh lettuce; tomato; and onion combined make their burgers hard to get a proper bite in your mouth all at once.   I'm not the biggest fan of the fries so I usually opt away from them and snag a couple of my friends though I have come to In N Out alone before (which is not pathetic on any level). So yeah; like I said I get the same thing every time switching back and forth between their delicious lemonade and milkshakes. The good thing about this location is the Yogurtland in the lot right next door. So if you ever see me around the Grigio; dont be surprised if I head over for some dessert after my 'gourmet meal'.  Note for vegetarians: If you're a vego you can order off the secret special menu. This menu is not spoken about; kinda like that guy on Harry Potter who's name shouldn't be said out loud. If you know about the menu and order it theres no problem but there's no chance you're getting an employee to tell you about it! Sorry; I won't be sharing their secrets here but if you're interested definitely look up their secrets online!  Since I've been living in Australia; I've realized how condiments aren't that big over here and find it frustrating how they charge you 50 cents for dipping sauce. Sometimes I can't be bothered spending extra on sauce since even Macca's is an expensive meal but baby do I love me some sauce. In N Out's; Special Sauce is so delicious and definitely worth the extra money for a packet. Though its probably just a mixture of mayo and ketchup (kinda like big mac sauce) it's an essential add on.   This is fast food but you shouldn't expect it to be quick and easy. Every time I go to In N Out; there's a drive thru line through the parking lot. Thankfully; they've got employees who wear goofy outfits standing outside with Ipads sending your order in when the drive thru is like this.  I understand I may have gotten peoples hopes up but I suggest going into your first In N Out experience with low expectations. I was honestly so dissapointed after my first try at an In N Out near LAX maybe Arizona's In N Out's are just better? I think I had just gotten my own hopes up but whatever the reason was for it to be so bad; I swear after my second try I became addicted.""",0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Double-Double; no sauce; cheese fries; diet root beer...  This is all I ever order at any In-N-Out (i loathe russian dressing)  This is where i go when I come to AZ to visit family.  What else is there to say about In-N-Out that hasn't been said??? An awesome place to get a cheeseburger.,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,How can you not LOVE a burger place where everything is FRESH! No freezers and a burger only costs $2!!!!  This location is great. They have a drive-thru that goes very fast. Often they have a person waiting to take your order instead of yelling it into a speaker box.   For a combo meal you can get a cheeseburger; fries & diet coke for $5 and some change.   The restrooms are clean and the service is very fast. There's plenty of parking & after you eat lunch; walk over to Yogurtland or Starbucks for dessert.,1

1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I'm convinced that the people who work at In-N-Out are either robots or being force fed antidepressants. They're the happiest food service people I have ever met - EVER!   I love the fact that In-N-Out's menu is so simple. I don't have to decide between 87 combo meals; or what sides I want. I get a choice of 4 burgers and fries; and that's that.   I got the protein style burger to work around my gluten free diet; and the lettuce was fresh; burger  tasty; and did I mention that the service was SUPER FRIENDLY! !,1
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I only  go here out of convenience and it's better than going to another fast food chain.... ie (burger king or Jack in the crack)  I usually order the secret menu stuff like; Animal style fries and Lemon up.  Sometimes the fries leave a bad taste in my mouth afterwards. Sometimes they also give me stomaches.... :-  Fulfilling; but not craving?,0
1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I don't understand what all the hype is about with these burgers.  Yes; they are cheap.  Yes; they cook as you order.  No; they are not flavorful and could use some hamburger seasoning.  The huge onion; even for this ShrekCousin; is just too much in a tiny burger.  AND they're always so packed....WHY?  It's like this side of America has given this joint a big name for no reason that I can understand.  The fresh cut fries are too soft.  Fries are meant to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with some salt lining the outside; served warm.  The shake was not sweet enough.  I've been here a few times as a suggestion from someone else; so I've given it multiple tries to impress me and it's failed the test each time.  Everytime after eating from this place I'm just not satisfied and would rather eat a hot dog and chips from Circle K with a thirst buster.,0
WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,This is the only chipotle I will go to! They are never shy with their portioning like other chipotles. It's always clean and even if it's busy they are still fast paced with their service! Best chipotle in AZ I've been too!,1
WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,The food at Chipotle is always great; but the service at this particular location is awful. The wait is only so long (even if there's no line) because the people behind the counter are slow to put your meal together; and they're always talking and joking to each other. Even when you're right in front of them ready to order!  I've been here many times because I love Chipotle and it was close to where I used to work. Terrible service won't make me go out of my way to this particular location again.,0

WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,They're always super nice at this Chipotle. Today they messed up on an order but quickly fixed it and threw in free chips... as it was part of the mistake.   I come here at least 5 times a month.,1
WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,I know it seems ridiculous to not only take the time to review a chain corporately-owned restaurant as popular as Chipotle; but also to award it five entire stars; but I felt pretty strongly that I needed to.  Chipotle has been a long-time staple of my diet; and I have ventured to it; nationwide.  However; this location is by leagues the most consistent that I visit; and I go at least once a week; since it is local to both my office and my home.  Service is always quick; even during the weekday lunch rush; and I never have to call ahead.  Also; there is one fantastically sweet and positive employee who works the cash register; and considering that we have a conversation every time I'm in; I can't believe I don't know her name.  Whatever. The point is that I am always a Chipotle fan; but I know I'm going to have a hard time adjusting to a new neighborhood Chiptole when I leave this neighborhood... and when you find yourself saying that about a fast food restaurant; you know they've made a real impression.,1
WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,"Food was okay. Service; however; did not impress me. I stood waiting to order as several employees passed me by and didn't even make eye contact with me; as if they were pretending not to notice me. Like what the hell? Can't they even mutter a simple \hello\""? Or \""someone will be with you shortly\""? Food wasn't too great; I won't be going back. I don't know why Chipotle has such good reviews; it's pretty mediocre.  I'd rather go to Taco Bell.""",0

WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,The right location. This Chipotle Mexican Grill is consistently excellent. The rice and beans cooked perfectly.   This location is never a hit or miss; always great food and great service.,1
WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,I always get the chicken burrito with veggies; black beans; and everything else on it. Service has always been great when I go in. One of my favorite eating spots,1
WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,Oh Chipotle how I love you...  Excellent fresh food; quick made to order; friendly people. What's not to like? Oh and their motto is Food with Integrity; meaning hormone free meats and locally grown veggies whenever possible. Fast food you can feel good about.,1
WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,This is my local Chipotle; but they've always proven to be pretty consistent whenever I've ventured elsewhere. The ingredients are fresh; the service is usually good; and the prices are pretty fair for what you get. I usually go with three soft tacos so I can switch it up and get one chicken; one steak; and one barbacoa. Variety is good. I also can't resist their chips and medium salsa; something about that hint of lime and the salt they use just makes it too hard for me to say no. Admittedly; sometimes their food really does a number on my stomach; but it tastes so good that I usually just deal with the consequences later. It doesn't hurt that their is this absolutely gorgeous girl that works there too; which ensures that I make a trip at least once a week.,1
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,"Stopped in here today for lunch; joined by Arlin B.; Robyn N. & Mike C.  For me; on this first Fatburger visit ever; the idea was to compare this place with a couple of my favorites; Smashburger & Five Guys.  I ordered a Medium Combo Meal; which brought a 1/3 lb. burger \with the works\""; & I upgraded the fries to onion rings & the soda to a chocolate shake.  Everything was good; but the shake wasn't up to a chocolate malt at Smashburger & the burger; while tasty; was down a bit for me compared to the other two.  The onion rings were delicious.  It's 4 Stars for this excellent but not quite tops burger place.     :-))  Medium Burger Combo $7.89; Shake +$2; Onion Rings +$1=$10.89""",0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,"I love the food at Fatburger; I just don't love this particular location. They always close ridiculously early and the times on the website are different than the ones here listed on Yelp: \Operating Hours: Sun-Thu: 11am-8pm | Fri-Sat: 11am-10pm\"". I've been in this location at 7:30pm and seen customers turned away around 7:45pm being told that they were already closed.  I recently went there on a Friday night at 9:30pm and almost all of the chairs in the restaurant had already been put on top of tables and employees were already walking out. My party and I ordered food and found a place to sit and I was enjoying my meal... until I found a long dark hair wrapped around one of my fries. I asked for a refund on my fries and was given one; yet without any apology.   Even though this location is closest to me; I only was able to visit a few times since they always closed too early and now I will never go back that I've found hair in my food. Find a cleaner Fatburger where employees care about quality and aren't rushing to get out of there.""",0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,Mmmmm the burgers here are awesome! I ordered the fries; though I was too full after eating my burger and shake that I didn't have room for the fries. A note on the shakes: they are the best! You can tell they are made with real ice cream because the texture and taste are just right.  The location was a little dirtier than other locations I have been too in the valley; but the food was good and the music fun!,0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,I've only been here once so far and I thought it was a decent place.  I wasn't sure what to make of the sizes when I looked at the menu; but the burger I ended up ordering was humongous and probably the largest burger I can remember eating. I thought it was pretty good; although I'm not ready to call it a favorite just yet.,0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,I have never been to Fatburger before and it's right outside the movie theatre I frequent; so we went early to stop for lunch.  Groupons are great!  Now I like hamburgers and fries; but my daughter LOVES them.  And Fatburger didn't disappoint either of us.  The burgers were juicy and cooked just right.  We also ordered bacon on them; and the bacon was cooked nice and crisp with thick slices; none of that see through crap you get at lots of burger joints.  Curly fries were nice and hot and fresh.  And when you have all you can drink diet coke; that's like a big fat cherry on top of a hot fudge sundae!  This place was great; a little expensive for a hamburger place; but really good nonetheless.  We will definitely stop back; especially since we walk right past it at least twice a month when we go to the movies.  Yum.,0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,Good food; great interior set up; and fun for everyone! I've tried a lot of the menu and any item is great. The burger itself is cooked well. While it may be tempting to order a larger burger when hungry I'd recommend trying a medium first as these burgers are pretty large.,0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,"Undercover Boss Fatburger was filmed here in April 2013....so I was interested to read the recent yelp reviews to see if improvement has been made. It doesn't seem as if people are impressed.... (I personally have received poor service the two times; I visited)  Here is a cut & Paste from a review of the show.... So perhaps it's not surprising that as the latest CEO to appear on \Undercover Boss;\"" Wiederhorn took to heart the troubles that an employee reported at a Mesa; Ariz.; franchise. Posing as \""Myron Leeds;\"" a former real estate agent appearing on a \""second chances\"" reality show; Wiederhorn visited the Fatburger restaurant and found that the franchise was a mess.   Angelica; an assistant manager; showed that the faucets in the kitchen couldn't be turned off. Sales were at an all-time low too; Wiederhorn conceded on-camera. And to top it off; the franchise -- which is part of a company that brings in $100 million in revenue a year and is looking to expand to 200 more locations -- has failed to pay its workers. \""By the time we get our paychecks; there's no money in the bank;\"" Angelica reported to \""Leeds.\"" While speaking to \""Leeds\"" during a break outside the franchise; Angelica also described in detail the problematic culture at her workplace. \""The only time we see the owner is when something is broken;\"" she told him. There's no positive reinforcement: The manager \""doesn't come around see how we're doing.\"" And then the ultimate blow in Angelica's list of grievances: \""It's like I am working for you -- but why?\""   Wiederhorn; for his part; seemed to take the criticism seriously. So in the reveal at the end of the show; he took the extraordinary step of inviting Angelica's manager; franchise owner Marcus; onto the set. And Marcus didn't put up a fight. \""I don't want to let you down anymore;\"" he told the assistant manager.   As a way of helping to boost the franchise; Wiederhorn told Marcus that he'd forgive a debt of around $50;000 that he owed him. And then he also told Angelica that he would pay for her tuition so that she could attend nursing school; as well as give her a $10;000 bonus toward a honeymoon. (She's barely been able to take a vacation in the two-plus years she's been with Fatburger; which is about the same time that she's been married.)""",0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,I love this place - the turkey burger; fries; and shakes are delicious. It's nicely decorated and homey with fun trivia and riddles on the numbered cards they give you to indicate your order. I've never been disappointed here.,0
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,Always liked Fatburger; the traffic at this location seemed slow; but the service was still exceptional.,1
jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,The food here is awesome!  This Location is convenient off of US 60. I eat here often when seeing a movie next door at AMC Mesa Grand 24.  I wanted to give this location 5 stars; but could not because I have not always had good service.  The service quality depends on when you eat at this location.  Usually the service is fast & friendly; but if you come here when the high school kids are working; service usually is ok at best; if even that good.  Overall very good except for a couple of times of rude service from the teenagers.  I reported the rude teenagers to the manager on another visit and he said he would look into the situation.  Service lately has been excellent.,0
tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Stopped in for a quick lunch and enjoyed a Carne asada burrito; just under $6.  Tasty and I noticed there was a fresh cilantro taste; much more so tht the standard f...berto's places.  Meat was a bit tougher than others but also there were fesh onions and spices too. I'd go again and they are amazingly fast at getting my order out,0

tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,I've been here a number of times and have had great service and very good food each time.  Don't mistake good for gourmet.  It's solid fast; mexican food. I usually grab the coupon from val-pak and save a couple of bucks. Nice salsa bar and very clean inside.  Very generous portions!,1

tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Honestly; I would normally never go to a place like this. Fast food and Mexican food together just doesn't seem like a good combo. I love Mexican food so I'm definitely picky when it comes to it. This place was just alright; the costs were surprisingly pricy for fast food; I've seen close to the same prices at an actual Mexican restaurant. The service was just okay; the lady wasn't super friendly but she wasn't rude either. The chicken wasn't my favorite; and the red and green sauce were just pure liquid; nothing special. It wasn't terrible but I probably won't come here again.,0
tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,I wasn't expecting anything incredible from this place. But I feel like you'd have to make an effort to have bad Mexican food. It was pretty bad. Well; more like just fast food. I had a beef taco and cheese enchilada with rice & beans. Taco was pretty greasy and the cheese enchilada had completely unmelted cheese inside of it. Service was bad and they were mid-cleaning everything when we came in to eat. Which was 2pm on a Saturday. I don't want to see that! Yuck..,0
tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Bomb Mexican food.  You know it's authentic when your food is all greasy ; and slopped together on a plate in a disorderly fashion.  Sub the ham for bacon in the breakfast burrito and add potatoes. You will not be sorry.,0
tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Was looking for another breakfast burrito option that was close to the house and stumbled on this place via Yelp. Ordered the Chorizo Special and Green Chili Burrito. Chorizo Special was OK. Would have been better if I liked my papas cooked like the culinary world says they should be cooked. I don't. I like soft papas. I couldn't really tell if the chorizo was spicy or not. Will get a regular chorizo burrito next time.  The Green Chili Burrito was excellent! Lots of filling and it was good.,0
tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,I like this place a lot. It's not a high-end Mexican place by a stretch; but they do a solid job at making really tasty meals for a really cheap price. It's amazing how fast the drive-through can be even when there are 15 cars lined up around the building.  Service is friendly and quick both inside and in the drive-through.,1
tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,first off; i ordered a cheese enchilada and these wasnt melted all the way on the inside nor the outside. i couldnt even stomach eating the rest. second; the wait took waaaay too long for the small order we had and it being 12 AM. i wont go here again. making sure the cheese is melted on enchilada isnt hard....,0
tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,this place is great !! i love the food ;service is good & its in a great part of town.. breakfast burritos are excellent!!!,1
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,This is not the best location I have been to but it seems like they are getting better. At times this location gets completely packed and with such a small parking lot you often have to park by other stores and walk over. It seems like during those busy times the service is pretty slow compared to other locations I have visited. Any other time service is quick and friendly and the food is always good.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Worst chipotle ever. SLOWWWW service; incompetent staff; and my burrito bowl is missing ingredients. Management- please do a better job at training your employees. They look like deer in headlights.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Usually Chipotle rates high in my book but this location is far from what it should be.  My husband and I were passing through on our way to California. It was around 11:30; shortly after the restaurant opened.   The line to place our order moves extremely slow compared to my other chipotle experiences; when I finally reach the counter they Are out of chicken; shredded lettuce and  fajita veggies; they tell me it will be awhile; so we settle for alternatives that aren't really what we want. We go to get silverware; that entire section clearly has not been stocked. There are no forks and knives; napkins all over the place.   To top if off I stopped in the. Bathroom on my way out; the bathroom was a mess. Paper towels everywhere and almost no toilet paper.   I would think that if you are opening and preparing for the lunch rush; you would prepare the key items for your store to run properly. Perhaps it was just an off day but I'm sure Chipotle would be disappointed with this locations representation of their name.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Horrible horrible service. I don't know if it's because it's phoenix or because the crew and management just suck but I had a horrible experience at this chipotles. They tried to load my burrito up with rice and didn't drain the beans making my burrito a soggy mess. But the worst part is that they gave me less meat than the previous two customers so when I pointed it out they guy just said he'd have to charge me for double meat. I said no; I just want the same meat everyone before me got. They either didn't get it or didn't care; either way it's a bad way to do business. I will NEVER go to this chipotles again.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Typical Chipotle flavor but the service staff always seems annoyed and they're light on that guac we all pay to have added.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,I visited at lunch time; around 1:30 PM. I didn't think there would be much of a line given the time; but unfortunately there was no parking and the line was out the door. Once inside I realized why there was such a big line: the employees are less than the model of efficiency. After waiting 30 minutes in line; I was unlucky enough to have a lady in front of me who was filling an office order for 10 people. Why didn't she fax in her order you may be asking? Well; she was well aware of the process because she had the DSL (Don't Stand in Line) bulk order sheet in her hand and usd it to read the order to the burrito makers.  So by the time they finished her order; they were a bit flustered and in a hurry. I was ordering two burritos and was further unlucky to have a phone order prioritized between my two burritos. I had to walk back and forth along the counter to tell each person what I wanted on each burrito. That was why they forgot to include guac on my veggie burrito even though I asked for it; and why I didn't notice until it was too late.  I've ordered almost everything on their menu and off their menu and eating a veggie burrito with no guac was my first negative experience.  Am I blaming them for having to wait in line 40 minutes? No; I only blame them for 30 minutes of it. Why was the manager out clearing tables when only a couple tables were occupied and while there was only one burrito maker on the assembly line?  I may go back to this location; but only to get some free guacamole.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,My girlfriend and I love Chipotle; and come to this location weekly for an easy and delicious lunch. Today; however; was much different. First; let me say that I have worked in the food and beverage industry for over 10 years; and customer service plays a big role in this environment. We order our usual meals and find a place to sit; my girlfriend immediately notices two black hairs in the cheese of her meal. She takes her taco plate back to the cashier; points out the hairs and that she believes it may have come from the cheese. The staff begins to show each other the plate; and laugh about the fact that there was hair found in a guest's meal; in front of more guests standing along the assembly line. They begin to make her meal again; but continue to use the same products as before; regardless that any may have human hair in them; even the cheese that was specifically pointed out to be the most likely culprit. I give this place 2 stars because normally; the standard of service is very high. This time;  I did not recognize a single person on the line; so I'm giving fault to inexperienced employees. Very poor customer service; not even an apology or offer to pay for the meal was given. I will now be driving to other locations as this one has lost its luster and appeal from poor management; food quality and customer service.,0

Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,The only reason this location gets 2 stard is because i luv Chipotle! I use to have this at least 2 times a week; but now its way less; and the only reason is for the disorganization at this particular location! Like a few other yelpers have stated the service here sucks. On multiple trips i have waited in line for 30+ mins cuz they ran out of stuff on the line and just not efficient. I work in downtown and go to the location at cityscape and that is a model location. Lines are crazy long but the line is always moving. I was soo pissed one day cuz i waited and waited then they got my order wrong and gave me attitude when i mentioned the mistake; so i went online and wrote their corporate office. I basically stated they should look into this location cuz it could do soo much better. Gotta say i have been back to this chipotle and nothing has changed :( so if ur craving and dont wnt to deal drive to the one on 99th!,0

Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Chips tasted terrible. Service was average at best. Check out person was rude.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,I really wanted to love this place; especially as they offered such a nice deal (BOGO) for teachers recently. But I didn't; and it had nothing to do with the service as other reviewers have mentioned. We did have to wait in line for about 45 minutes; but I know it was because of the teacher promotion; and I was happy to wait my turn. The portions are; indeed; massive - but the food was only so-so.   I was stoked that they had organic; hormone free chicken -- but was bummed that they were 'out' of it (and according to a friend; had been out of it for at least a month... due to a supply shortage?). Regardless; I ordered a double wrapped pork burrito and a chicken bowl. The chicken was really disgusting - super chewy; poorly cooked thighs; and the pork was slightly better but just tasted a little 'off'. The rice was slightly greasy;  and while the other toppings were ok; I went there for the meat; and having that be bad in both of my meals (I ordered one for the next day but tried them both that evening while they were fresh) just was a bit of a buzzkill. The place is also fairly pricey for a casual take out joint.   I doubt I'll go there again; but if I do for some reason; I'll try the vegetarian option and update this review accordingly.,0

Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Chipotle has always been good to me when I am in a hurry and this is no exception. People who complain about the price should go get food poisoning at some hole in the wall place or at least research it's price range beforehand online (like using yelp DUH) They are fast enough for how busy it gets and I have never had a problem they don't instantly fix. I suggest ordering online because if they get it wrong it's free; and usually still edible / good. The one off the 101 by costco has given me personally at least 15 free burritos/ bowls.  Happy rolling!,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Food was cold. No chicken or steak  had to wait for employees to finish their conversations before giving the lady making the food the meat. Wanted chicken but didn't feel like waiting another 5 min fir my food. Had to wait longer since the front end ran out of cups then employee decided to have a conversation before bringing out the cups Update still bad service. maybe they need to train better. employees prefer to have social hour then help the guests in their store,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,We've been frequenting here for five years now and their food is always consistent.  Service is great.  My only complaint - well; there's 2 - is they are SUPER busy during lunch hours and the parking isn't so great.  If you go off peak; no problem.  As far as Chipotles go; this one definitely passes muster!,1
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,I'm visiting from California ....  The guys serving were GREAT! When I got to the cashier; she had an attitude when I asked her if she charged me twice when she slid my credit card 2x!  Order #381 was my order and her nose ring isn't very appetizing.,1
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,"The 2 stars is mainly for the service.  They were extremely slow!  I have visited other Chipotle locations and even when there's a line; they are fast and friendly.  When I finally got to the register; the girl at the register had to ask me 3 times what I ordered and even though I told her 4 times that I wanted a large drink; she kept handing me the small drink.  Maybe it was because she was more concerned with a co-worker (who had either just gotten off of work or was on break) telling her a story about a friend of his who was having a baby.  It was pretty ridiculous considering the growing line of customers behind me.    The food as usual is delicious! Can never go wrong with a chicken burrito bowl!  However; the guy who was taking the order was in a huge hurry (there was a long line as usual during lunch) and put less than 1/2 the amount of rice and beans than what is usually put into the bowl.  I had to ask for a little more of each.  When I asked for extra lettuce; the girl putting it on gave me a look like \Really?\"" and begrudgingly gave me extra lettuce.    I think I will be heading east to the Chipotle in Avondale next time.  I've never had a problem at that location.  P.S.  Parking is not the greatest here!""",0

Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,The staff was very friendly and I received fast service; but I was very disappointed in the quality of the food.  Most pieces of the steak were too fatty to eat.  I'm willing to try them again - hopefully will see an improvement.,1
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,I've been here several times at it is always the same experience;  SUPER SLOW and less than good service. I try to eat by the Paleo plan; therefore I get no rice or beans here.  When you don't  order rice or beans (the huge filler ingredients) they look at you crazy here. I asked for a bunch of veggies and my steak. I received a pinch of veggies and  barely 1 scoop of meat. When I asked the lady for a little more of each I was told I'd have to pay extra. Stingy. I wasn't asking for extra; just a fair amount.  Not going back to this location.,0

Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Don't order online. You pay for what you order but sometimes meat is forgotten; and you're paying for items you don't get. Otherwise the food is good and the people at the counter are friendly.,1
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Last time I visited; I placed an order online. I know; burned in the past; but thought I would give it a second shot. The online ordering site allows you to pick a time; and gives the people there at least fifteen minutes to get your order ready. I selected a time; and was at the store 5-10 minutes after the time it should have been ready. When I got up to the cash register; the girl there had to print out my receipt and hand it to the people making it. After a few words with them; they stuck the receipt with my order on the wall.   I had to stand there waiting another ten minutes before she went over there again; and had to tell the guy at the beginning of the line that I was there waiting for it.The place where I work only gives me a half hour for lunch; and the lines at this place are notoriously slow; so I thought I would be safe ordering online.   The food is definitely not as good as it used to be. In fact; the bowl I got was pretty watery. Not something I'm used to from chipotle.   All in all; I don't think I'll be going back. And I dont think I will miss it.,0
Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Horrible customer service... The employees are more concerned about talking with each other and joking around than they are listening to customer orders. IF there is even anybody at the register... good luck. It'll still take forever! Very sloppy; unorganized; and lazy store.,0

dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Ate here for the first time tonight.  The menu consist of chicken fingers or a chicken sandwich meal.  I got the 3 pc chix finger meal for 5.99. It came with texas toast;  fries and dipping sauce plus a d drink.  I like how the chix is breaded and moist.  The sauce is really good.  The menu may be limited but I believe that is what helps the service to be quick. I like it and will return.,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Visiting my brother in Gilbert; we had a large to-go order.  Nothing special here.  Hot; semi-crispy; moist; and flavorful.  Dipping sauce was better than the chicken.  This place blows away nasty places like Chik-Fil-A; but pales in comparison to similar fast-food offerings such as Popeyes.  Overall: AVERAGE.,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,If you don't like chicken fingers; you aren't going to like this place.   Fortunately; I do. The chicken was moist and flavorful; with batter that wasn't greasy at all. The Texas toast was perfectly toasted and didn't have that weird microwave popcorn taste. Fries are crisp and taste really good too.  The sweet tea was excellent.   Clean restaurant; quick service and friendly staff.,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,"This place came highly recommended by my foodie mates! And today; we finally had the chance to give their offerings a go!   We arrived at the drive through; and they offer; basically; deep fried chicken fingers. 1.09/small battered deep fried chicken finger.  The drive through intercom was muffled and loud. We had to repeat ourselves 4 times to order our food; 2 times to correct out order. We also told the food clerk that it's our first time here.  After we placed our order; we moved forward to pay at the window. The cashier looked as if we were bothering her with something. No greeting; no smile; and was not helpful at all when we asked her (what the order taker did not answer) what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. Our inquiry was; AGAIN; ignored and left unanswered.  After paying; we picked up our orders. We asked; AGAIN; what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. The response we got was \Thank you; have a nice day!\"" We thanked the girl; but we asked the same question; AGAIN: what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. \""Ketchup!\"" She said.   5 minutes later; we arrived at the flat. Opened our much anticipated recommended grub! We ordered 6 piece combo meal; 3 piece combo meal; and my 3  pieces of chicken fingers with Ketchup. There was 3 pieces of napkins for all orders; and one of their special sauce in a small container.  Overall; SERVICE was subpar based on our experience going through the drive through. FOOD; were greasy; fries were soggy and not thoroughly cooked; the *only* seasoning we all could taste was salt. Oh; and the bread was plain white bread... Toasted only on one side.

dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Impressive for a soft opening!  Parking is tough; not sure the parking lot will be big enough.  Ordered 4 piece combo. Took awhile to appear at the table but understandable.  Food was hot and very tasty!  Problems I felt was very cold and it is very loud. It was maybe 1/2 full at 6:15 and we could not hear ourselves talk :(   Since they call your name for ypur order it makes it very hard because we could not hear our name called. Not sure what can be done about that.  We will be back so please look for an update ;),0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,The chicken fingers were good but everything else was lackluster. The coleslaw was bland and the french fries were terrible. The french fries always get soggy and cold too quick when I eat to go. The last visit they also flat out forgot to provide the Texas toast in both the meals I ordered. I was pretty surprised because I saw the girl at the front counter check the meals before she put them in a bag. The quality needs to be more consist.,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Love these chicken strips! So yummy! I need a barrel of the canes sauce in my kitchen so I can dunk everything I eat in it! Never been inside. Always drive through but it's quick my order is always right & my food is still hot & delicious when I get it home to eat it!,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Good place for a quick bite of chicken & texas toast in Gilbert.... I had always seen Raising Cane's in Las Vegas but never did get around to eating there. Finally on my 2nd trip to Arizona; I was able to see what the fuss is all about. I was quite satisfied.  I got the 3-piece chicken combo with crinkle cut fries & texas toast. I substituted the cole slaw for another piece of that damn great cheese toast. Loved it... The chicken pieces were good; especially dipping them in that cane's sauce. The fries were good. I was dipping some of those crinkle cut fries in the cane's sauce too. Make sure you order extra. And yes; they do charge for them. I loved the bread; like I said and I dipped that too in the cane's sauce. Everything was good and tasty. The food wasnt too greasy. I wish we had Raisin Cane's in LA. It would do well & kill it IMO... Gotta have the sweet tea. I love me some sweet tea and free refills on that goodness?? Game over. It's the cherry on top. Get it!,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews? I was there on opening day and have returned several times since then. This place is busy! Service has never been slow; but lines are common due to the sheer number of people.  Any kinks associated with opening a new store seem to have been worked out. There are still crowds but service is on par with the other locations. The food is great; I love the lightly breaded chicken and the garlic bread.  Canes is like In n Out for chicken. All they sell is chicken; no burgers.,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,I came here orders the 3 finger combo..comes with 3 fried chicken fingers;  crinkle fries; and a piece of garlic bread. The chicken itself was really good just a little oiler than I would like but definitely 100x better than KFC. They only have chicken fingers and chicken sandwich so if you want something different this isn't the place for you. Plus they have some tailgate options with larger portions for parties. But I would definitely come back.,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,The food is awesome and the customer  service is great! Fresh food every time we came. The staff is always cheerful and helpful. I never have even one bad experience with them. I go to this place at least twice a week. It opens until 11 or midnight unlike the time said on this page.,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,This is a great place for a simple Chicken Finger meal....... It had great fry's - dipping sauce- and fantastic service...... With all the fast food places around this place  really know how to treat a customer rights.  Great tasting food too ;,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,"I really like Cane's and now there is one just up the street from my residence. I like Raising Cane's; but my kids are raving fanatics about the place!   As with all new places; this one is not quite as good as the older brother located on University Ave. My recent midday family trip had our strips slightly tepid; orders slightly off and the fries just \meh\"". However the wait staff is trying hard as the infatuated rush rolls in.  We will be back; probably many times.  Don't forget to request your Cane' s Caniac Club Card!

Yes; that is correct.  You have failed 100% of the time I have ordered something from you.    The first time I ordered (drive thru) a Caniac Combo and 1 extra chicken finger.

You really need to check your order before you go.\""  I was floored  by the employee telling me I needed to double check your staffs work every time.  The truly sad part was she did not offer to give/comp me the two extra fingers I ordered even after telling her of my past experiences.  Not good customer service in my opinion.  Someone in a polo shirt walking around; asked how my order was going and I told him my past experiences.  He volunteered to give me two extra fingers on top of my order which was nice.  After receiving my order; I visually checked everything; and all my fingers were present and accounted for.  Walked out to my vehicle and realized holly cow you did it again.  Even after telling multiple people how my order has been short each time I have been there; YOU STILL DID NOT GIVE ME MY DRINK!  That's it.  3 visits; and each time I have been shorted even after speaking to what I can only assume is a shift lead or supervisor.  Please fix your staff training problems.

dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,I am a chicken lover; all types and varieties. I also have eaten more fast food in my life than is medically advisable. This is the zenith of both avenues. Raising Cane's has a chicken finger that is simple; yet executed flawlessly. The menu makes In N Out's menu look complex by comparison. It's simple: you want tasty chicken fingers fast? Here you go.   The breading on the chicken is thin and provides just enough flavor so that you enjoy it but the chicken is still the main emphasis.  The fries are also thin crispy crinkle cut masterpieces; a perfect complement.    The staff is also always excited for you to be a customer but not awkwardly over involved with you. The balance is actually quite well done: fast service with a strong attitude of making sure I am happy with the chicken.  Not how people don't rate this five stars; simple; fast; tasty.   Maybe the only negative people get cranky about is because it's so popular the drive through often wraps around the building....but you can already see why that would be a good thing right? If people are waiting in the drive through 10 minutes to get it clearly it's a high quality product.,1

dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Okay; so my first thought was dang this place is arrogant. Only offering their sauce; no bbq; no ranch; etc. After a few bites I was floored. This place is epic! The chicken was amazing; the sauce with the chicken is unbelievable; the service was awesome. I will definitely be back; too bad its such a drive for me :/,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,I have been to Tempe Raising Cane's; so nothing was surprising. But; this time I ordered 30 tailgate chickens. The chicken fingers here were crispy and much better quality than the other fast food chain. Also; the atmosphere was desirable for those who seek for the casual dining. I like the disco ball they put on the ceiling.   Although I went there around 10:30PM this place was busy with younger age people around 15-18 years old on Thursday night. I am not sure why they are eating this late... Anyway; I ended up waiting for 10 minutes until our foods comes in. I was impressed with their customer service. There were off duty employees lined up in front of me waiting for their food; but our ordered became the priority just like boarding on the airline as the first class passenger. Their customer service was excellent. However the ONLY REASON WHY I REDUCED ONE STAR  is because THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE FRENCH FRIES which was also my order. I found out about this later when I got to my house. Well; I understand that everyone makes mistake; so this time; I do not get that much upset at this since I liked their customer service.,1

dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,I was excited to see this place open up near my house.  I took my 6-year twins because they love chicken strips.  I was quite disappointed when we went.  The service is absolutely atrocious.  I believe employees should have fun where they work; but these kids took it to a new level.  Many of the employees were horseplaying; and were therefore very inattentive.  We sat in the dining room far from the front counter and could hear the employees yelling and singing very loudly (and badly).  Again; I don't mind employees having fun; but not at the expense of some degree of professionalism.  My kids liked the food; so if we ever come back (not likely); we'll go through drive-thru.,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Quick and friendly service at the drive thru. The chicken fingers are huge; more like strips; and fresh chicken breast meat. Unfortunately; that's where the positives end.   The only good part of my meal was the coleslaw; which is usually my afterthought and gets thrown out. The chicken was tasteless; as were the fries and watered down lemonade. The sauce? While I understand it's a hit; I HATE ketchup ... The sauce is mostly ketchup; mayo; and pepper ... Yes; I know there are other ingredients. BUT they really should offer alternative sauces since the food is so bland by itself.   I'd like to say I'll try something else next time; but just like no other sauces; they have no other food either lol.,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,"My expectations were high for Raising Cane's after a friend raved about the place. So maybe my review is a little harsh after the let down I recently experienced here. But all things considered; I don't plan on coming back to Cane's any time soon.  Atmosphere: it looks like they sent a 15 year old into Walmart and told them to go crazy. They have wood walls; steel chairs; and a disco ball. Movie posters from classics like \The Hangover II\"" hung up in one corner and fine art in the other. 1/5 stars  Wait staff: I guess the cashier was still in training because the manager was giving her a quick run through. The only problem was he came up to her right as I was coming up to order. They then l proceeded to ignore me for two minutes to finish their talk. After we ordered; the food took about 15 minutes to come out. So slow for fried chicken and fries!  Food: the chicken was good; but who messes up fried chicken. I got the 3 peice combo and I was a bit dissapointdissapointed in the proportions. I paid $7 for three chicken strips that were gone in two bites. These guys were tiny so if you are hungry expect to shell out at least $10 to fill up.""",0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,"Super friendly staff with quick service. Family friendly atmosphere; I was there with my two girls.  Odd combo of chicken fingers and texas toast. Fries were good. Chicken is a bit too deep fried for my liking; the chicken taste is masked by the \fried\"" taste. Overall a nice alternative to a burger joint.""",1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Ive went a couple times and its always busy so the service can be slow. Food is good but a little pricey. The Texas toast is great! I think they should offer a dessert. I took my dog with me in the drive thru and they have doggie treats!! The parking lot is way to small especially during peak times.,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,This raising canes is good but it's not up to the quality of other canes. Maybe they haven't been open long enough but there are a few things the need to get in order to earn 5 stars.,0
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,I really wanted to like this place but I guess that's not going to happen. The food wasn't that great but the service was good.  The chicken was very dry and the fries were nothing special. And their special sauce is nothing special; it's just mayo; ketchup; and pepper. At least that's what it tasted like to me.  They don't have much of a selection. I think there only 3 different types of meals you can choose from. I wish they had some meals that have dark meat.  The Texas toast was the only thing that was enjoyable. It was fluffy and lightly toasted.  We went through the drive through and it took a very long time to get the food and then we almost didn't get our drinks. And then we get drinks and they aren't the right ones.   All the employees were very friendly. They get 5 stars!,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,Really really GOOD chicken fingers! The Mgr was really nice and gave me a sample of the special sauce so I could be sure if I Liked it. I LIKED IT!  Great customer service!,1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,"The employee was helpful with my order because I wasn't sure what to order. She told me that the \Box Combo\"" was popular and filling since I wanted something but not to be stuffed. The food came out hot and ready to eat within 5 minutes. They kept this location very clean; the food was great; \""healthy\""; and enjoyable. Definitely coming back soon!""",1
dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,This location is finally open and I can try their food!!! everything was pretty good for the most part. You can't really mess up chicken fingers or fancy them up. The chicken was crispy and tender and so were their fries. The chicken meals come with a garlic butter toast which was good but seemed a bit out of place ad everytime I took a bite of the toast I wanted spaghetti. The service was great; everyone there seems happy and energetic; probably because it's their first day open. It's a fast food joint but the workers came around and provided service like offering to take our trash and giving us refills. overall it's a pretty good spot if you're in the mood for good quality chicken fingers.,1
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,"I really wanted to give these guys 5 stars; but it's the price of things that made me go; \no; I can't.\""  I've been dragged to many Weinerschnitzels in my lifetime because my friends have hot dog cravings and this one was IMPECCABLY clean. I mean; I wasn't scared. The floors were spotless; the tables gleamed; even the serving counter was immaculate. The place where food was put behind the counter was something my anal retentive self fell in love with - it was all sparkly clean; napkins piled neatly and in an orderly fashion. I nearly fainted.  I even commented on it and the guy behind the counter said; \""We want to have our customers see a clean place. Not a dirty one.\""  Much love as I do have for the cleanliness; I think they made up for it in price. No deals; nothing. I'm used to seeing a dollar menu-ish type of thing. The ones in California have them and I should know because I see the promos for them on TV here in California.  I was surprised to see that a chili dog combo (2 chili dogs; medium fries and drink) was $5.99.  I should've persuaded my friends to hit costco and gotten the hot dog; drink AND an ice cream for a little over $3.  Nice clean place; but dirty high prices for a fast food joint.""",1
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,My son says the hot dogs are pretty good; but the service is not good at all.,0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,Several months ago swung by for several hot dogs and three orders of fries. Went through the drive thru and when I got home my order was short.   Drove 20 min back to the location and was lucky enough to get attitude from the night manager ( Martine ). He was disgusted that I was angry about the situation. I finally just gave the all the food back and asked for a full refund. He took the food and balled it up and slammed it into the trash can by the counter.  He made sure to bill me for the coke I forgot at home. Horrible customer service from this member of their management team.  The worst part of all; I contacted Wienerschnitzel 24hr customer service later that evening. The rep was very sorry for my experience and stated she would pass it along to all parties. She informed me I would be contacted as well asap by an operation rep. Three months later not even an email.   Horrible customer service.,0

zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,I have grown up with Wienerschnitzel all my life and I love there chili dogs. I always make a stop through this location for their 5 for 555 especial and the staff is always friendly and they always provide me with outstanding service. The store is always clean and inviting . Great job!,1
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,If I could give less I would. In drive through; three cars ahead of me one behind. Waited over ten minutes. Finally car behind me backs out so I can too. Go to Mc Donalds next door get food and pull around and two of the cars ahead of me are still in line. Super poor service. How hard is it to throw a dog on a bun?,0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,You have to like this kind of food to like this place. I grew up with wienerschnitzel so I love it. The location is generally clean but as with most fast food the service is sub-par and the facility is so so. You don't come here for a 1st class experience so in truth I get exactly what I expect and keep coming back. I wish the workers spoke English but the junk food is great.,0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,"Ok; we stopped in for their \special\"" which is 3 chili burgers; 3 chili dogs and 3 small fries.  We asked if we could substitute and get 2 chili burgers; 2 chili dogs; 2 corn dogs and 3 small fries.  The cashier said he didn't know but would enter it to see. Good news!! Yes; all of that for $9.99.  The food was honestly only 3 stars... Which of course is just basic... Not bad; not great.  The reason for the 4th star is the shift manager TONY.  He was very personable; checked in us 2 times to see if we needed/wanted anything else.  Mind you; this is a fast food establishment.  The counter area was immaculate; the dining area was SPOTLESS; the floor was clean and the restrooms were very clean.  Generally when a restaurant is this clean it is a direct reflection of management and their commitment to having a well run shop.  Hats off to Tony and his crew in this regard.  The food; as I said earlier was only so so; but the overall experience was exceptional.  We got out corn dog; chili dog fix so we probably won't be back for a while; but I wanted to share what I felt about superlative service.""",1
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,Totally disappointed. I wasn't paying attention when I pulled into the parking lot and I thought I was going to Whataburger. Imagine my surprise when all I saw was hotdogs on the menu! Took me a minute to figure out why; but once I did; since I was there; I thought I'd try something. Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect. Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that; has mustard too; perfect way to eat a hot dog. Shakes were on sale; so i got a chocolate one. The shake was ok; it didn't make it back to the office; but not because it was 'awesome'; it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had. Got to the office; opened the bag; pulled out the hotdog and; well; was quite disappointed. The photo shows a HOTDOG in a bun with a nice stripe of mustard and a heaping amount of sauerkraut. That is not what I got. I got a hotdog in a BUN; with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard. Ok; so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs; where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side; so i was expecting as such. That's how the photo looked; but no; no dog sticking out. took me two bites each end to find the hot dog. and it was no bigger around than my finger and was tasteless. Won't go there again.,0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,I love Weinerschnitzel; but this location is FAIL.  I went in with a coupon for lunch as I was working down by ASU that day. I placed my order to find out that it would have just been cheaper if I had ordered the combo instead; but then discovered that on top of it all the clerk rang me up wrong. This isn't usually a big deal; so I just asked that they correct my order to the pretzel bun chili dogs that I enjoy so very very much.  Short version of the story was that the manager was rude and I had to swipe my card again for another 60-something cents for the pretzel bun upgrades. A good manager would have just done it for having screwed up my order but he copped an attitude with me as well.   Maybe he mistook me for an ASU student trying to cause him trouble and not; you know; a paying customer. Who knows.  Just make sure you speak slowly and make them read your order back to you (TWICE) and you should be fine.,0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,"Back in the day Der Wienerschnitzel was consistently cheap at its very many locations but there aren't too many around anymore and you gotta be careful with your order and use coupons to eat at the prices its quality would mandate.   Corn dogs are still 79 cents all the time; chili dogs are 99 cents only after 9pm without a coupon.  The manager is the owner or is paid based on sales as he is kinda stinky about the coupons.  You do have to double check your bill and order \properly\"" because the specials & coupons won't always ring up right and a combo won't be a combo unless you order it that way.     It is clean; clean; clean.... it MUST be an owner/manager.    Don't forget to ask for onions with the chili dog... who would ever dream you would have to do this?""",0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,"Sadly; I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.  Sure; the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive; don't seem to be meth addicted; and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often; and I know why.  My beef is not with the crew members; oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy; the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.  This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually; one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon; this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order; give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously; what is it; 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order; cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu; they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said \sorry\""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then; was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.  Last trip here; they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last; I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip; and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat; I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order; ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order; says \""This is your order; this is what you have\"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me; the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand; gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that; even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him; puts his hand in front of the guys face; and says \""ssssshhhhhh\"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening; he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog; what does that cost you anyway; about 12 cents in batter; a stick; and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?    Dude (cashier guy; tattoo on your arm); tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you; I truly am.  What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there; I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L.; get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana; they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that.""",0

Let's be honest; it's only $.30 cents...But I feel that that statement goes both ways.  Don't you worry folks; the story is not over; five minutes later he brings over the original small fry... That is now of course cold.  Good old Wienerschnitzel... Where you have to pay for their mistakes.""",0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,Jhon gave us great customer service he saw us cleaning the table and immediately stopped us and he cleaned it for us def the best wienerschitzel I have been at it makes me want to come back here and eat someone promote him...he looks like he could be an awsome manager one day,1
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,Have not been here this year.My experience of roughly 20 visits was always good with zero problems or complaints. I enjoyed many different things. It was never fast but not a problem. Always clean; orders correct and polite. No drive through experience. I enjoyed everything and liked trying things.,0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,We had never been to a Wienerschnitzel before; and after this dinning experience we will probably not be coming back.  We were going to Bookmans and thought this might be a good quick stop for something other then tacos and burgers.  Watching some of the LA Angels baseball games on TV this past summer made me think of Wienerschnitzel and their 50 year celebration.  After eating here; I cannot imagine how they lasted that long.    The only other hot dog chain which I have eaten is Nathan's Famous.  Even though Nathan's has it's own short comings; they at least have a product you might actually want to eat; other than at 2 o'clock in the morning.  This is a hot dog place; plain and simple. They serve Oscar Meyer type hot dogs; though that might be a disservice to Oscar Meyer.  There is something about their Original hot dog that seems lighter; or air filled.  When I mentioned lighter; I mean that they weights next to nothing.  The bun weights more.  Combined with it's lack of taste; you wonder what you were eating.  In a blindfolded test; you would never guess.  For the record; we had couple of Original Hot Dogs; a Polish sandwich Meal deal (which was much better then the dogs); Jalapeno Poppers; Chili fries and two sodas which all amazingly came to $12 or so for the two of us.  They also charge 25 cents extra for a second ranch dressing for the poppers.  Six poppers and only one sauce?    The employees behind the counter were fine.  They were not a factor in on our decision to skip this place in the future.  In the end; it was just the food that was tasteless and uninspiring.  Admitedly; we did not try their Angus beef hot dogs.  So maybe we were missing something from the Weinerschnitzel experience.  Ehh!,0
zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,"We came as a dine-in and the cashier taking our order is the same one taking the drive-thru orders; so while ordering our food we kept getting interrupted. We went for the classic hot dogs and (unknowinglt) they since added a new beef hot dog which we picked. We weren't given the option for cheese so we received shredded cheese. After realizing the all beef all hotdog wasn't the original; we asked and were told about the original hotdog was different so we ordered another hotdog and also asked about the cheese; we were told it was the original cheese was american sliced cheese (in which we weren't given that option). So after we finally thinking we got our \original\"" hotdog; it had some bad tasting wheat bun??? Yuck... we were disappointed with the changes and won't be eating here again.""",0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Have been there a couple of times. Food is good. Service is always slow. Last time we were there my husbands salad had an ant crawling around. I was very disappointed that no one came over to apologize nor did they offer to discount or comp it. Not cool.,0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,The customer service was horrible. The host did not pay any attention to us. The waitress could care less about our table and just brought the food out and left. I wanted dessert but she just handed us the check without even asking us and went to talk to her coworkers. No wonder this place is almost always empty. Although the food is pretty good I don't know if its worth the awful costumer service.,0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,We live in Troon within a mile of this location so we were very excited to try the food.  Its tucked back in a strip mall off the main road so keep you eyes open or you'll miss it for sure.  When we pulled up and got out of the car our mouths started watering from the smell in the air.  We were told the burgers where outstanding and that they had some new items on the menu.  My wife ordered the ribs and I ordered burgers and fish sandwiches for the girls and I.  The rub on the ribs was excellent however the ribs were obviously boiled then kissed on the grill so no smokey goodness but decent flavor thanks to the rub so lets give them a B-.  I should have ordered the regular burgers because the sliders where lame compared to many we've had around the valley and the fish sandwiches were so greasy we took a couple of bites and left both sandwiches on the plate.  All in all we were not impressed however the owner or manager came by our table and was very friendly and the service was good not great. Bottom line we will give it another try and update the review later.  We are going to try them for breakfast.,1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,"Really nice place! We came here last night in a group of 7 and it was a great experience. The service was quick and friendly and the restaurant is good-sized with the right amount of tables so you don't feel cramped.  The menu is very diverse and I love the \make your own salad\"" or \""burger\"" selection that each had a ton of different options. Their portions are very large and can easily be shared or taken home for a lunch or another dinner.  I made my own salad with solid albacore tuna with their fresh veggies and the balsamic dressing on the side. Everyone's order was correct and prompt and prices were great. For 7 people who had dinner; some had appetizers and everyone had tea or soda; it was just under $100. We are making this our standard place for our monthly meetings now.""",1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,A group (6) of us went for lunch today to celebrate my birthday. Perfect day for patio seating; which they had ample tables available.  Server was very attentive and friendly.   Looking through the diverse menu I see lots of options that sound great. Great options of soup; salad; entrees; sandwiches and burgers. I settle for a cup of the Crab corn chowder which was very good. Extra points for serving oyster crackers with the soup as many do not. The chowder was the right consistency of thickness.   I opted for the build a burger option. There are diverse options to make your burger from buns; traditional toppings; or special toppings like a portabella cap; roasted chile; etc.  My burger was a ciabatta Kobe burger with pepper jack; roasted chile; guac; spinach and chipotle aioli. Once I got the burger which looked awesome; I cut it in half and noticed the patty was thin. Maybe a 1/4lb and it had a very uniform circular shape as is if it came from a frozen pack.  I told myself that they probably had a press back there and to proceed. The guac looked a darker brown than usual as if it had been out or wasn't freshly made. They had avocados on the menu so I assumed it was fresh. The bun was grilled; spinach super fresh drenched in some cheese and a chiles.   First bite was good and got a bit of everything but something was off. After dissecting a bit the guac definitely tasted as if it came out a package and the Kobe was a frozen hockey puck. Upon examining the grilled results of the Kobe it resembles more I a black bean veggie patty; which I made sure no one else at the table had ordered.    For a place that's supposed to be a burger joint this is an extreme disappointment. I can get a burger at a better price that's handmade and way more fresh. Cutting corners and costs on guac when you have fresh avocados is not very endearing either.   The rest of the entrees that came out for our table looked great (chef salad; BLTA) but if I return to this location it won't be for a burger again.

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,One of the best kept secrets of the Troon area...kinda of a hidden gem if you will...and perfectly located considering the vicinity of the Pinnacle Peak park hike.   The prices are very reasonable; and the menu is very extensive offering everything from salads to appetizers and everything in between such as burgers and healthy sandwiches. I had the Pinnacle chicken sandwich and it was absolutely scrumptious...I ordered mine in ciabatta bread and it came with lettuce; tomato; cheese; bacon and avocado.  The service was very friendly and efficient and certainly didn't miss a beat. They also have a lovely patio and serve breakfast. Highly recommended. Will return without a doubt.,1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Awesome soups. Had the lobster bisque. I also had the club on sourdough. It was excellent. The red pepper humus was very nice as an appetizer. Service was excellent and brisk. Well be back often.,1
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Went for dinner the other evening. The place is attached to a cigar shop & the smell inside the restaurant was horrible!   We both ordered the same wings & were served two different orders!  They did exchange the order but how hard is it to get it right the first time?  There was only a couple of tables at the time. When the check came the waiter forgot to add the liquor beverages & we had to point that out & he changed the bill. Hmm. A restaurant that gives away free drinks with dinner!! The whole experience was not enough to make us want to return. Too bad as there are not many dining options nearby.,0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,I had just finished the Pinnacle Peak hike and was hungry tired and thirsty.  There were some flyers at the trail head for the Pinnacle Grill that offered a discount. I decided to give the place a try. My hamburger was absolutely superb.  The bun was very fresh (Perhaps they make them there) The large angus patty was cooked to the medium rare I ordered; and the side salad was large and had a nice variety of greens and other salad ingredients.The service was superb.  The meal was appropriately priced.  I am not from Arizona; but would definitely return to this place.,1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,If this place wasn't so close to our house I definitely would not come here. The service really depends on server and it is very hit or miss and often phony friendly attitude. The food quality and portions are very inconsistent. The owner is often physically present; but has no idea what's going on or what's even being served. Our food has been wrong; burnt; stale; raw; over cooked so many times...you name it and they've served it. I've even gone in to pick up food before and no one knew where my order was...they gave it to someone else. You think a manager; the owner; someone would take responsibility for it...not here! If you live in the area and really need something to eat; that's one thing; but personally it's worth driving 5 more minutes in the opposite direction of this place. Maybe new ownership and a new manager would help.,0

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Always great!  Great service and yummy vegetarian options. One of the best veggie burgers around.  Josh is an awesome server!,1
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Wow! Where do I start...  I came here when it was called Blu Burger and I loved it then. Now it's under new ownership; and even better than it was before!  The place is very warm and inviting. It has been redecorated in a cool; contemporary style. There is new; much nicer paint; and there are at least half a dozen plasmas displaying sports in HD.  The menu has been adjusted to include even more items than before. Everything from build-your-own-burgers (my personal favorite) to crab cake sandwiches; salads; soups (I had the Lobster Bisque it was delicious!) and so much more I can't wait to try.  I ordered my usual Kobe California burger and it was simply delicious! The meet is so tender and juicy; I can't even describe how good it is. Quite honestly the best burger I've ever had.  All in all; I am very excited for how far this restaurant has come since I started going; and the new owner seems to have made a great restaurant simply excellent!,1
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,I went to Pinnacle Grille with my girlfriend for lunch.  The menu really looks awesome; but unfortunately neither of us were very hungry.  I ended up getting the Cobb salad and it was really good.  Everything was fresh; the greens; the grilled chicken; the bleu cheese; everything.  The  vinaigrette was the one thing I wasn't super pleased with.  So; if you get this salad; try a different dressing.  My girlfriend got the fat free sesame dressing on her salad; it was really good.  I really liked the ambiance and the service was really good.  I think the only thing keeping this place from being really popular is the location; it's like being on the moon out there!  However; I would certainly go back if I was in the area again.,0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,For the most part the menu is divided into three sections; appetizers; soups and salads; and burgers and sandwiches. This is not your average burger joint however! The choices are enormous for all of the categories and if that was not enough the burger section is truly build your own from the type of burger (13 types to choose from including non-meat selections); 8 kinds of buns; cheese; toppings; sauces; and more.  Fortunately they do offer prebuilt selections as well and I went for the Pinnacle Salmon burger which turned out to be the most amazing salmon burger I have ever tasted -- period. Before the burger I had a cup of the Kickin' Crab Corn Chowder which was wonderful -- but a cup? What they call a cup would be a bowl in any place I am used to.  In general the portions are very large considering the prices and our table over ordered selecting a couple of appetizers to try as well. The Chips & Guacamole are very good; the Tomato & Mozzarella is outstanding; and the Pinnacle Fries are awesome.  It seems that most places that try to be incredibly flexible with their menus and are generous with their portions compromise somewhere on quality to get there. The Pinnacle Grill; however; seems to be an exception where quality; flexibility; and quantity come together in a truly amazing combination. If you are anywhere in the area do make this a stop - you will certainly be glad you did.,0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,"Stopped here after a hike on Pinnacle due to its proximity. The food here is just not that good.   I ordered a small stack of buckwheat pancakes. The pancakes were Luke warm and tough. The thing that gets me is that you shell out a decent amount of money; yet the butter comes in little foil wraps. I HATE THAT! I might as well bring my own stick of butter if I wanted to spend 15 minutes opening little packets. I expect that at a La Quinta downstairs  crappy included breakfast; not here. Plus; the butter was cold so as I spread it; it destroyed the pancakes.  Wife got a \meh\"" omelette. Again; luke warm. The side of tomatoes were unripe and tasteless. Her turkey sausage patties were cold; hard; and obviously previously frozen and reheated.   Overall; the Pinnacle Grill was uninspiring; disappointing; and blah.""",0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Great place! Great food and excellent service! Highly recommend! I love their grilled cheese and creamy tomato basil soup. The burgers are also superb!,1
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Really long menu with lots of options so you can customize every meal!  Also-- long list of soups.  Love every one I have tried so far.  Also; great service.  Very personable waitstaff who look you in the eye and engage in conversation too.,1
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Awesome restaurant. Great service. I was served by a girl named Jessica and she was great. I am picky and she made my order perfect and never let my drink go empty. I'll definitely be back because of her!,1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Recently pinnacle grille has deteriorated. Living close to this restaurant made it our go to; however the last visit sealed the deal and we will not return. Ordered dinner as usually with a calamari appetizer; the calamari was cold ( partial frozen) and we made this obvious to are waiter who acted unconvinced. The owner who was present completely ignored us and we actually had to request to the waiter that we would not pay for the appetizer when the bill arrived. Pinnacle grille needs better ownership/management/waiters. For now will drive further into town to enjoy a consistent meal with actual owners that care.,0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Everything I've ever ordered here has been top notch and a good value. Great service. Definitely a place you can eat at often without breaking the bank.,1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Yesterday was my first visit to Pinnacle Grill and I have to say I was very happy we gave it a try. It was kind of empty due to seasonality; but that actually worked in our favor as we got some time to chat with our awesome server Lisa. She was a lot of fun; great with the kids; and made some wonderful recommendations; along with stellar service. The menu is in somewhat of a transition as they are adding new items and taking off some others. Overall the menu is diverse offering everything from great burgers to higher end tasty dishes. My son built his own burger which was delicious. Quality Angus beef cooked as ordered. My daughter ordered the fried calamari and thought it was great. My wife ordered the ribs and enjoyed them as well. I had the chicken marsala which was a varied version of the traditional; but it was delicious with a richly flavored sauce. Also as a starter we shared some chicken wings and they were nicely cooked and tasty... not too spicy either. One of the great qualities of this place is that the food is original and fresh with everything homemade as far as we could tell. It is so hard to find good quality food as we have become overrun by the Olive Garden style restaurants of today. This place is not a chain! Great food at a reasonable price. I will be happy to go back in the future and look forward to trying new menu items as well as being served by Lisa. Enjoy Pinnacle Grill as we did. A great place tucked away off the beaten path; but well worth the excursion.,1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,"It often looks too busy for my taste at the Pinnacle Grille when passing by (I live up the street)... but it was empty and serene this past afternoon so we decided to give it a try for a late lunch.   My girlfriend and I both had 'Royal Pinnacle' angus burgers  (swiss; sautéed mushrooms; caramelized onion; spring mix; and tomato on a ciabatta bun). Both burgers were delicious and done exactly as ordered (one medium rare; the other well). Most burgers are around $11 including a side... both the steak fries and sweet potato fries were good.   I just wanted to mention this after seeing 'JD A.'s review. I don't doubt his account; but also noted on Pinnacle Grille's site that a new chef from San Diego just started in May; 2011. For what its worth; the attached press release also said  \In 2009; San Diego Tribune selected his burger as the best in the city\"".  Whoever they had grilling did a great job (OK.. its not rocket science)...   All I can say is that we were satisfied; the service was great; and we plan to return... might even brave a crowded 'Happy Hour' sometime.""",1

k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,After a hike on Pinnacle Peak; it was natural to stop here for a quick bite. Loved the hummus because you not only get the traditional pita bread; you get sides of tomato; cucumber; carrots and celery...Since I was seeking a healthy lunch to reward my conquering of the mountain; I tried the salmon salad which was incredible with a dressing that was to die for! service is friendly and attentive without being overly intrusive. Definitely will be back to try the other menu items because it was refreshing after a hike!,1
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Came here last night.  It doesn't seem right that I am giving this a 3 star review.  Nothing was particularly wrong; it just didn't click with me.  To me; the restaurant had a weird vibe when we walked in.  Smelled cigarette/cigar smoke right off the bat; probably the cigar bar in the same building is waifing over so if you are sensitive to smells; beware.  The service was good; the food was good too; so on those counts I would return but the atmosphere was just off.  When I put the entire experience together I probably won't return.  With all the restaurants in the valley I will find another place to try.,1
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Went for a quick lunch and  waited for at least 45 min for two soups and finally asked to pay for our beer we had and canceled the soup. Waiter never put in our order!  There were maybe  6 tables on the deck at any time during the time we were there and saw at least 5 different people waiting tables or bringing out food. All the people passing by us and no one asked to see if we wanted anything including another drink. We had to flag down our waiter then. Poor management! Waiter didn't charge us for our beer but we left without eating and will never go back.,0
k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,I've eaten here numerous times and offered my opinion. The last two times sealed it for me I can't put myself through another meal. The food orders are often made wrong the service is terrible and even if it is a local business it's just plain not good.,0

UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Chipotle is one of my favorite places to eat thats fast and cheap.    The menu is pretty straight-forward.  Tacos; burritos; bowls... pick your ingredients; move along.  Your meal will be assembled at light-speed so stay sharp!  If you really only want a LITTLE BIT of sour cream or salsa or whatever; say so LOUDLY and CLEARLY or else it will get slopped on there like everything else.    It can get really crowded during weekday lunch; go at 11:00 or 1:00 to avoid the rush - or if you are going to pick up; fax your order in ahead of time.,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,I love this location! I really think all the employees there know me by name and by my card (as it's a Hello Kitty Visa); hey don't judge! Anywho; the manager/owner is always working and he isn't always behind the register; he's actually picking up and greeting everyone in the establishment; I love that! Crazy concept but interacting with your customers; brings them back. Aside from the service; their food is literally always fresh and to order. I've never had any overcooked food; or old/stale vegies. It's in a great location and just very convenient.  Personally I always go for the burrito bowl; but they have lots of alternaties and especially for the vegietarians/vegans.,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,I love this location! I really think all the employees there know me by name and by my card (as it's a Hello Kitty Visa); hey don't judge! Anywho; the manager/owner is always working and he isn't always behind the register; he's actually picking up and greeting everyone in the establishment; I love that!

UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Joey W wrote; Chipotle wins on consistency. That is so true. Consistently bad food; consistently poor service. I hate Chipotle. Its fitting that this chain was once owned by McDonalds; because Chipotle has done to Mexican food what McDonalds did to American food; destroyed it.  To me; Chipotle represents everything wrong with America. If you really think about it; kids today are growing up and eating at places like Chipotle. This is their exposure to restaurants and customer service. If this is what they see as the norm; how do we expect to get anything better out of them when they enter the workforce. They can only emulate what they know; poor quality; a don't give a crap attitude; being rude; and insolent.  Every Chipotle I have ever been to starts at that base level and goes down from there. Some are so bad its disgusting; like the one at Topanga Canyon in Woodland Hills; CA. This particular location in Scottsdale is not as bad as that one; but it is bad. I would like a veggie burrito; black beans and brown rice. No; not pinto; I said black. No fajita. Thanks. I said No fajita; stop; NO fajita! This was to go. I said To go; how many times do I have to tell you this - its to go! A typical conversation at Chipotle.  The burrito was a street food in northern Mexico. I don't think it was ever meant to look like a baby's filled diaper; as Chipotle has perfected that look. Why do they need to stuff the f*&^in thing so full that it explodes when they roll it? How is this appealing to anyone to have a big messy drippy mess? Has anyone noticed that the only predominant flavor in the whole mess is onion? There is absolutely no flavor to anything else. You could not possibly ever just try to order a bean and cheese burrito at Chipotle. It is the most flavorless; creation. The beans have no flavor. The cheese is completely void of any flavor. The sour cream is just runny; it is just slightly thicker than pouring milk on your food.  There is a small section of Colorado that should be completely wiped out. It has tormented this country with the likes of Chipotle; Einstein's Bagels; Smashburger; Qdoba; Noodles & Company; Boston market; and about five others. All of these chains are the same; they adopt one kind of cuisine; remove all the flavor and uniqueness the original item had and serve it up across the country; making everyone think this is what food is. It is absolutely disgusting and revolting. It is creating a bland; monolithic society that thinks all bagels should be soft with chocolate chips.,0

UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,great service here. Management cares!!,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Just had the biggest burrito ever in my entire life.  The foil paper couldn't even wrapped my whole meal.  Love it here because everything is so fresh and the service is so excellent and fast.  Totally beat the dinner service rush.,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Food is great. BUT DON'T BOTHER ORDERING ON THEIR APP!!!!! We arrive 5 min after the pickup time & they had no clue we ordered online. Not much of an apology given; just an uuhhh we didn't see it & we end up waiting 20 min. there was hardly anyone in line either & when we finally got the food; we get it with a huff. Not polite and inefficient. Train your employees please & a little more courtesy would be fine.,0
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Sofritas; FTW!  One of my fav vegan meals from a fast chain. The sofritas are SO good.  I cannot get enough. The perfect blend of spices & flavor... Tofu never had it so good. Burrito; tacos; & bowl; brown rice; white rice... I love it all. Accompanied with their perfectly salted tortilla chips & the best guacamole in the galaxy; this is the business.   This location is insane during the weekday lunch crowd. It's a smaller location so the waiting line is always out the door. During the summer; this is no bueno. Do yourself a favor and order online or via their mobile app; so you can skip the line; pick up your food; & go. If you're paying with a credit card; you can pay online too. Even better!   My only real complaint is that this location sometimes overcooks its tortilla chips.   They share a parking lot with other restaurants and stores; so that lunchtime madness spills over into the lot. Good times.,0
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Typically go on Saturdays. Always really busy. Wait time around 5 minutes. Great service and as always; great food!,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,I just felt when I was ordering that they were yelling at me on every ingredient. do not like to be yelled at order my food. this was not a busy time it was about 2 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon.   Janet was my host and I was order number 339,0
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Ah Chipotle; you lure me in with your cilantro-lime rice and woo me with your guacamole. I'm such a fan of the burrito bowls but hate the burritos -- too much tortilla ruins the flavor for me. Great and fast service.   Drink area is in a bit of an odd place and this location is PACKED at lunch -- avoid this area if you can between 12:00PM and 1:00PM Monday-Friday.,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Whenever I have a craving for some fine Mexican burrito I turn to Chipotle!!! The ingredients are always fresh and oh so delicious!! The service is always friendly and mighty fast!! Your burrito or bowl is done right in front of your eyes!!! :) I will keep coming to this Kierland spot for more since they deserve the business and always give you everything with a warm smile!!  Makes my tummy happy!!!,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,You can't go wrong with Chipotle. This location gets crazy busy at lunchtime! Steer clear at 12pm. I've been going closer to 1 to avoid the zoo.  Parking is limited but it's a nice location.  Tip- order online and skip the line!  Tip- try one of their margs,0
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Arrived at noon on a Monday and there were about 40 guests eating and 6-7 in line. I was thru the line in 2 minutes. These guys know how to run a fast line!  I ordered a barbacoa bowl. It was good; with all ingredients the proper temp but there just wasn't much protein in the dish. Closer to home; I get about 1&1/2 the amount of meat. Probably better for the Scottsdale socialites?,0
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,I first off have to say I love Chipotle! Good food; pretty decent price; for the new age fast food market (fast food that isn't a burger). Their chicken is my fave and their guac and chips are the best in town I think.   However; I for the first time today took what seemed to be the advantage of ordering online. My office all wanted lunch from there and the line can be pretty ridiculous at noon; so I figured I would pre order then just walk in pay and be on my happy way. Not so much. I will say that the ordering process is great; very easy and fast; took just a few minutes then hit send. But when I got there is when the annoyances started. Our food was not ready on time. I made a point to watch the person that walked in right after us and see how quickly they got out of the building; they won; we were still trying to pay for our order. It was seemingly very unorganized. The girl at the register kind of pointed us in a direction where someone would come out from the kitchen to give us our order; we were not allowed to pay or fill drinks while we were waiting; and it was to difficult to ask any questions that we were too frustrated to ask for extra salsa.   On top of that while we were waiting the lady that was making our food came out in the middle of prep to talk to another customer about franchise opportunities and how much their building rent was. **Note to the jerk off that thought it would be a god idea to pull the manager out of the kitchen to discuss business at noon on a Monday: HELLO!? Are you serious? Time and place buddy; time and place. Call Corp for these silly questions. Arg!   Anyway; the food is good; but they really need to get a better handle on their service. A bit of a cluster f*** if you know what I mean. I am a huge fan of ordering online and getting things fast; but I do not recommend using these opportunities at Chipotle.,0

UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Chipotle is a great place to get a fast; reasonably priced vegan meal. I always order the vegetarian bowl with rice; black beans (pinto beans are not vegan); grilled peppers and onions; pico de gallo and hot salsa; corn; guacamole; and lettuce. Yum. My husband gets the same in a burrito; and sometimes adds cheese. Good; fast; and filling. One reviewer here could do with fewer onions. I could do with less cilantro and perhaps brown rice instead of white; but other than that; no complaints.,1
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,This is one of my favorite places for burritos. I love the chicken; pork; and steak but for some reason I usually order the chicken. It has a very unique taste. Of course the food is fresh. Plus at this place i have never had any problems wrapping my burrito. I've been to others that double wrap or they have to start over. Not too cool.   Service is always fast and friendly. Only problem with this place is sometimes finding parking can be a little hard.,1

UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,The food is simply AWESOME. Love the free app to order in ahead of time; jump in front; pick up your stuff or eat in. I'd give a five star if it had free wifi and was a tad less cold in it's athmosphere. Something we notice with many fooleries is that the outside area is far from inviting or inspiring to stay very long. Add a few huge shrubs to create space and cool.,0
UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,"Is a Chipotle; a Chipotle; a Chipotle?    Which translated means: yes; yes; and YES -- you are about to have a great meal!  First; avoid this place between 11:30 am to 1:30 pm; unless you are into pain; or have a death wish.  Like Five Guys and Jimmy Johns next door; the parking lot can become very crowded and somewhat of a mess.    I tend to leave my car at the office and walk across Scottsdale Road playing Frogger with the cars.  A good suggestion to avoid some of this is to order online.  Most App Stores offer a downloadable \Chipotle Ordering\"" application which makes it easier.  But after that; stop by and pickup a delicious Burrito; Taco or Bowl of goodness!   If you order anything; make sure you include the Guacamole and Chips.  You would have to go to Mexico to get anything fresher; or for that matter better.  Enjoy!""",0
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,Right across from Rips. Perfect for after drinking food. 2 burgers and fries and drinks for 15 is pretty good. Very friendly service. One complaint is the burger meat wasn't the best but the toppings make up for it. I'll come back.  Update: This place closed. Disregard above :(,1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,One of the best burgers I have had in AZ.  I had the burger special that included fries and a drink for $6.99.  Not bad these days. Good atmosphere.  Friendly service.,1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,"I cannot really remember a time when I was a customer somewhere and I was treated so well with genuine friendliness. Not the \yeah you're spending money here so we will treat you nice;\"" but like they want to become your friend or something. Da Burger Shack as I was told; has been at this location for about 8 months now which is probably why I never heard of it. The motto on their sign outside is \""We welcome you like family not as a stranger.\"" Which was hopeful; I'm a sucker for small town treatment.   We were greeted nicely upon coming in; I noticed that they had some sort of contraption that produces cold drip coffee. Looks cool and tastes great. The atmosphere was like a mix between Cheba Hut (w/o the marijuana references); Hippie Gypsy; and a tropical hut. Whoever decorated that place has great taste in music and icons. The setting was small but cozy and very colorful down to the tables being painted.  There was nice outdoor seating but it was too warm outside to brave the elements. I was shocked to see they offer something called the \""Big Tsunami;\"" which is 10 ground beef patties topped with pastramis; 10 slices of American cheese; 2 fried eggs; diced onion; tomatoes; lettuce; and their special sauce (which is fabulous btw) all for $20~if you get the combo for $1.75 more you get chili cheese fries and 2 drinks. It is recommended for 5 or more people. Then I noticed they have something called Big Moke Burger which is 4 patties with 4 slices of cheese; bacon; carmelized onions and so forth for $9. They also have a Hawaiian Loco Moco plate. Alas; I did not try the cheesecake I saw they had in their refrigerated case.   The food:  Fries-they give you a TON of fries for a regular order; I hate to see (or maybe love?) what a 'large' looks like. They seem to be the frozen crinkle kind. They were still good; my only suggestion is to maybe make homemade; proprietary house fries?  Burger-great; although I don't eat meat my partner loved his burger. It seemed to be loaded with bacon and I was assured it was quality bacon; not the cheap kind they give you at fast food places. They use really soft; buttery kaiser rolls for the bun. My only gripe is that I wish they would offer a Boca; Morningstar or  Amy's veggie patty instead of a squishy portabello mushroom. I just don't feel those textures match up with a bun.  Conclusion: so much good food for very little money; do not come here on a diet. Of course you could try to get away with it by eating their salads but come on; willpower is not your strong suit. During our meal the older gentleman checked on us and we chatted; I wanted to get up and give him a hug and I don't like touching people. So sweet to everyone who came in and everyone seemed to be regulars; it was like Cheers; he knew everyone's name. He's giving the owner from Tokyo House a run for his money in hospitality and I love that guy.   I have some Kiwi's from New Zealand that I would love to bring here and I'm sure they will love it. Mahalo Da Burger!""",1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,"As I waited for my to go order to be prepared; I noticed an older man struggle through the door with his walker. He parked his walker near the beverage station; and maneuvered slowly to a seat. As he sat down; the girl who had taken my order was already en route to his area with a large iced tea and 2 sweet n low packets. They obviously had some unspoken arrangement. She knew what he wanted; and delivered it promptly with a big smile on her face. I couldn't help but feel at home; and comfy. I have been told before that I am super insensitive.. and this made me feel really good inside.   Enough with the sappiness-  I think I missed the part about there being 4 patties on my burger.. this thing was a monster. I feel super guilty for eating the entire thing. I may even go to church this Sunday to ask for forgiveness. Ok maybe not; but you get the picture. Church is dumb.   My only gripe would be the done-ness of my beef. Next time I will ask for medium cooked patties. This; of course is a personal preference. All the flavors were on point. Bacon; Pastrami; Cheese; Onions; and Pineapple!?!?!?!!!! Jesus Christ!! Holy Shit! With 4 patties! Da Shack be holdin it down for realzzzz.  I didn't even get to my chili cheese fries. Honestly; after eating that burger (in it's entirety) I can't even look at them. They are on my desk at work right now. I may hide them in another employee's work area because he put a tampon in my protein shake container a couple weeks ago.. Perhaps rested above his cube on a ceiling tile? We will see.  The young lady who took my order was a sweetheart. Food was redonk. My iced coffee tasted spectacular; and got me dread-shakin-hyphy.. Prices were more than reasonable.. in fact; they could probably be raised. My department head was like; \Aye Ricktastic.. what did that meal cost you? 20 bucks?\"" -\""naw mane.. dat shit was like $10.50 on da serious tip\""  He doesn't really call me Ricktastic; but I wish he would-""",1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,Customer service was great. It had that local; know everyone's name feeling. I felt like I was at a burger shop by the beach and not on my break for lunch in hot as hell AZ.  As for food; I had a pastrami burger which was perfect! Greasy and full of flavor! Then I tried the chili cheese fries. Which were a surprise; they are good; but keep in mind the chili is sweet. I enjoyed it. To top it off I had a lemonade. Yum yum.,1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,I have been eating here for about 2 weeks now. I have been working my way down the menu and have not had anything distasteful or visually unpleasant. The food is amazingly tasty and has great fresh ingredients. You can tell the beef isn't frozen by the taste and the staff is always smiling and really helpful with customizing your order if needed. The pastrami sandwich is just delicious. You get a lot of food for the money and I don't have a single complaint. - Suzie Q,1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,I found this gem of a place thanks to Yelp! I was needing to grab a quick bite before going to the Phoenix Children's Hospital as I did not want to waste good calories on bad food!  They are super super friendly here! The service is terrific - cannot ask for better.  I had a bacon cheeseburger with BBQ sauce and asked if they had fresh jalapenos (they did - yay!) and added at no extra charge. The burger is very large - I didn't try the fries. Everyone looked happy with their food and it all looked wonderful.  I would definitely go back if ever I'm in that part of Phoenix again.,1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,"I really want to love this place so badly. I moved into the Cheery Lynn Historic neighborhood about three years ago and have watched several places fail. I've hoped somebody would buy this cute little place and make it into something great.   So; my husband; son and I went yesterday with high hopes and hungry bellies. We've been looking forward to trying it since we got a menu on the door the other day.  I hope as they move into their new space; they update the decor and get rid of some of the previous owners' decor. Such a big part of going out to eat; is the ambiance. The building is so cute and there's so much potential for it; but what the original Two Hippies owner did was just plain awful.  As far as the food goes; I am unfortunately sad to report that it was just not that good. My first \beef\"" is the beef. I originally posted that I had thought they used frozen patties; but received the nicest reply stating that they do get their meat locally and it is never frozen. Perhaps we just came on a bad day. I ordered the Loco Moco and I had to cut my hamburger patty with a knife and fork. I was also excited to try the homemade macaroni salad; but again... not so good. It was more of a mayonnaise-macaroni soup. Way to runny for my taste. But that's just me. My husband got a burger and it was okay. The best thing we got was my son's hot dog. It was just a plain hot dog with ketchup but it was pretty tasty. I'm thinking that when I go back (and I definitely will so I can give them another chance and I can support my neighborhood joint); I'm going to get one of those hot dogs. They have all sorts of exciting options for hot dogs including homemade chili (my favorite).  They do have really delicious strawberry lemonade and tropical iced tea.   I feel bad writing anything bad because I'd really like to see the new owners succeed. They were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. They responded to my original post and were very; VERY sweet so I know once they work out all of their kinks; they will do well.""",1
IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,Da Burger Shack has two things you rarely find in the valley.    A genuine friendly staff and HARIO COLD DRIP COFFEE!!!  I'm somewhat torn to tell the world; so I can horde it all for myself.  That hunk of wood and glass next to the counter is actually an expensive way to brew low acid strong coffee.  For whatever reason it's in the shack and they sell it.   I can't write enough how friendly the staff were.  They really bring that island friendliness; in the typical cold city culture.    As for burgers; my first trip was daily dealled with fish n chips.   The second outing was Cal Burger filled.  Both meals were satisfying; but not sensational.  Their daily deal is an outstanding value; so outstanding it seems to be always sold out when I stop by.      As for atmosphere; not the place to bring your first date; but definitely a good place to call home after several outings in need for comfort foods.  The food is a 3 plus 1 for coffee and service.  I'll be back for the rest of their pictured food and coffee of course.,1
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,Not my first choice; but went there to be with friends.  No complaints. Bright; clean; well organized; and well maintained.  I had the burrito bowl; which is an unwrapped burrito; and my wife had a salad.  The meat is tasty; tender; and nicely done; with adequate char.  The rice is done properly; as are the beans.  The lettuce is good quality.  Good quality food and service.  Solid.,1
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,"Occasionally service is good. 90% of the time the employees are disinterested; rude; and untrained.  Two things that really bother me:  - The employees are not trained well. How hard is it to teach your employees to drain the beans so I don't walk away with a soggy; falling apart burrito? Or that \light sour cream\"" means less than a full spoon.  -The restuarant can be empty with the parking lot completely full.   Honestly; if you have the time; I suggest driving down to Baseline.""",0
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,This Chipotle went above and beyond. I feel that it is too common today for big companies not to take care of their customers; but to give them a product as cheap as possibly while quality and service suffer. I never find that to be the case with Chipotle and especially at this location. I am moving to a new apt and after being mistreated and robbed from Direct TV and Century Link among many others. I felt as if no large company actually valued their customers anymore. This Chipotle ended my day a little better by proving me wrong. I requested steak for my burrito which they were momentarily out of. I had to wait literally less than a minute for the steak to finish being prepared. Because of my brief wait Chipotle comped my meal. Shit if I ordered something from a traditional fast food restaurant it still would have taken longer than the 2 minutes it took to make my burrito. I understand this isn't something Chipotle will do every time in this situation. But I have always had a great experience at Chipotle so on top of that today they reminded me; not only do we put out a great; fast product; we also give a fuck! Thank you to the crew working tonight at 8:30!,1

NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,I always feel like a whale after I eat this but I can't help myself. So good. Line gets long here around lunch but service is quick so it goes by really fast. I love the burrito bowl options because it tricks my body into taking in salad as a meal (although I wouldn't really compare it to a salad haha).,1
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,*sniff* I can't believe I was made to cry (on the inside) no less on New Year's Eve. My hubby and I came here thinking we would split a burrito since I know how big the burritos can be at Chipotle.    We waited in line. I watched the two guys in front of me each get 2 tortillas each for their burrito and the girl behind the line really piled on the rice; beans; and their choice of meat. I was thinking; wow; these burritos are even bigger than what I remembered.   Then when it came my turn for my burrito; the girl behind the counter took one look at petite me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpy serving of rice; beans; and seriously like 5 pieces of meat. I felt so crest fallen.  I looked at the measly portion that was going to be my burrito; I looked at the girl behind the counter and asked why the two guys in front of me got such massive burritos but not me. She just rolled her eyes at me and went on to the next costumer.   Boy; was I disappointed. And I checked too with those two young guys in case they paid extra for their mega massive burritos. Nope; same price as what I paid.   I seriously wanted to take a photo of my burrito next to theirs cause mine would look like the runt of the litter. It was so pathetically so much smaller in size.   I thought maybe it was an off night but from reading the other reviews; many other customers have received the same uneven service.   Chipotle corporate; you should take note since as corporate you take such pride in providing a good product and service- that is the Chipotle brand and signature.   Well; this particular location is not making the grade.   And *sniff* now I know what being an unwanted stepchild feels like. *sniff*.,0
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,I've only been to other locations around the valley; but finally had a chance to visit during my lunch break with my family. I must say the line looked pretty long as we pulled in to find parking; and we almost left thinking it would take forever. Luckily we didn't leave and to my surprise the line zipped by and everything we ordered was delicious.   Besides their good food; I was pleased with their customer service and speed. Everyone was friendly even though the place was crowded with students and business people on their lunch break. The manager (?) came around and asked how everything was and gave my family children vouchers for free meals the next time they visited. We were happily surprised with the service and thoughtfulness and a little later when leaving another employee asked if we had a good meal.   I would definitely come back to this location again:),1

NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,Friendly service! ;)   Love love love the food! Not sure if its real Mexican food; but make me wanna go to Mexico. ;),1
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU; and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.,0
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,I ordered a burrito bowl and my bowl was half empty. I was also rushed to make my order even though the two people (in front and back of me) were treated courteously. I will not be going back to this establishment.,0
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,poor service; employee's did not know how to operate register; and manager did not either.,0
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,I've been going to this chipotle since attending asu in 2008 with absolutely no problems other than an understandably long line. This past month; however; I've visited the Mill location two times; both very disappointing.   Both visits my barbacoa was not chopped enough and I had to deal with pretty large chunks of meat.   The service was beyond unacceptable. Staff were talking to each other and ignoring customers; as well as chatting with customers making the already long line even longer.   It even seemed as though some staff were poorly trained and could not properly prepare or serve a meal. I had to repeat myself multiple times to get my correct order and ended up with a sloppily made burrito.  It's unfortunate that this location had some sort of a slip up... I'm most likely going to have to start going to the Tempe marketplace store if this kind of service keeps up...,0

NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,I expect a lot more from Chipotle. I don't know if it's because it's so near a college campus; but the quality here is pathetic compared to every other Chipotle I've been to. The meat is often cold; the rice is hard (likely leftover) at lunch time. The chips are stale/hard/thick and not the light freshly-fried taste that other stores have. The guacamole is just avocado; and nothing else; I've ordered it three times and got only avocado.  I've made complaints through their corporate office and the quality continues to disappoint. I wish there were another Chipotle close to me that I could eat at instead.,0
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,Food is awesome and fresh but some employees have attitudes specially the girl that was incharge of taking orders. Hopefully management does something about it.. overall its a good place to chow down when ur hungry!,0
NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,Horrible chiptole.  Parking lot is a hazard; I've almost had a few accidents here.  The parking lot is way to small for the amount of traffic this place gets.  This location is pretty much always crowded and long lines.  The service is subpar.  I've had a few instances when I would call my order in ahead of time and I would walk upto the cash register only to have the lady help 5 people before I can pay for my order.  Rural and baseline location is much better and far less people.,0

CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,"This place is just okay as now we are closer to this location; we do have to go here. But the service at this location is horrible. There is this old lady; who just keeps shouting and never able to understand the order properly. One day they had run out of beans altogether and we were just getting 1 kids meal to go; so there was no option but to take 2 boxes of rice.  At the end while paying this old lady shouts at her co-worker looking rudely at me and says \Charge them for 1 extra rice\"" I said \""why . you have ran out of beans; what is the other option I have. She then realized and had her foot in the mouth. She is always yelling; at the payment counter person; basically Indirectly  shouting at the customer \""Charge them for this extra\"" this that... She is soo rude. Please train her on some soft skills.""",0

CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,This visit was awful here. The employee who didn't have a badge but was Asian screwed up the entire order. Was charged for guacamole which I didn't get the bowls were made wrong and the line was out the door. Customer service was awful. My chips and salsa was no there. Talk about a nightmare this is the worst location I've ever been to. I understand it's fast food but really I've had better service at food truck then this awful location.,0

CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,I am always impressed by the chipotle chain. I came in around lunch time and there was a line to the door but I waited only 3 minutes (at most) to order. Customer service is still great even at the fast pace they are working at. Some of the food is a bit spicy for my taste but I love the barbacoa and guacamole!!,1

CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,It's Chipotle.  I mean what else can you say that hasn't already been said? This location is always busy no matter when you come; but the food is good (albeit it is getting expensive) and the service has been good. Just remember; get to this location early if you want to eat and be able to sit; otherwise you are out of luck!,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Every time I order online to pick up lunch; the food is always cold (not just lukewarm - but COLD). They need to figure out some basic time management. When I go through the line the servers are usually pretty nice. I have noticed that the portions have decreased over the past 3 years.,1
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,First time to this Franchise and this location. Well lit; in strip mall; good parking and no line at 7:30 pm. I ordered a Taco meal; menu did not specify how many Taco's included. You are asked soft or crispy tortilla ( make sure your tortilla is steamed nice a hot ); by the time I started to eat mind; it was cold. Next choose your meat; ( make sure meat is stirred ) my meat was cold. Next you get to choose; lettuce; salsa; sour cream; guacamole ( extra cost ). Needless to say my Taco's was cold and soggy ( to much salsa ). But my beer was cold! My friend had a chicken Burrito; it was okay; not warm; soggy; taste was okay. The employees tried to be friendly but I could tell they did not want to be there. Total for this visit-meal 1 Taco meal; 1 Burrito; 1 Beer and 1 small fountain drink was $20.00.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,I love Chipotle. However; I absolutely hate coming to this location. 1st: The parking is awful. There is never anywhere to park. 2nd: this location is so slow. The workers are more concerned about socializing; eating; or standing around. Just recently; I went during rush hour dinner time. When I was walking in; there were 2 workers on the patio talking about how they are going back to work late. Then as I'm standing in the huge line; I see 3 additional staff get in line. There was 2 people making the food and one person checking out. Those making the food were so slow and could care less about the line. 3rd: The staff is so rude. At all other locations; the staff greet you as soon as you enter and again as soon as you get up to order and again when checking out. At this location the staff say nothing. When you get up to order; they stair at you till you talk. When you ask for something; it's always done with eye rolls and moans. During the same visit as discussed before; there was a lady behind me with a little girl under 5. The lady and her little girl waited in line for over 20 minutes. Mom kept telling the daughter they had to get this for dad and couldn't leave. When she got up to order; she asked the girl for a kids meal to go. She asked for it to be put in a bowl because her girl couldn't have shells because she has a gluten allergy. The server began to fight with the lady refusing to put it in the bowl. Some guy came from the back; who I assume was a manager; and continued to fight with the lady. In the end; they made the lady pay for an adult bowl.  These staff members do not care about the customers or anything but themselves. This is the worst Chipotle ever. DO NOT GO HERE. The BEST Chipotle is only a few miles away on 59th Ave and Northern. Drive the few extra miles to this FABULOUS Chipotle!!,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,I will never understand why places like Chipotle (even Taco Bell) who have all the food precooked; and all the server has to do is scoop it into a tortilla or dish and wrap it up; can still manage to work so slowly as to get their line backed up for 15 minutes with only a few people in it (as if I'm at a Subway)!   I am not at all prejudiced against hippydreadlock folk based on appearance; but the rasta chick happened to be the problem this night; since she was moving in slow motion like she was blazed off of her gourd.  I don't understand why I can get as much salsa as I want; on the side in a cup; with my burrito and there's no charge; but as soon as I order a bag of tortilla chips then i HAVE TO pay for that same cup of salsa.  Still good food when it's what you're in the mood for; but this particular Chipotle loses a star for gross incompetence.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Went to this location for lunch today! No complaints whatsoever! The music was loud for 11am but we are young and don't mind. The line was a little long but was quick. The portions seemed to be accurate according to other trips to chipotle. There was someone to promptly ring in our order and take our money. Restaurant was clean. Perfect lunch today!,1
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Chipotle makes life easy.  They serve 3 things.  Burritos; Tacos; and Salads.  Just 3.   But they serve those 3 things THOUSANDS of ways; With or without 3 kinds of meat (and yes; you can have a little of each.... I have done that when I couldn't decide); with or without any of 7-10 different ingredients. And yes; you can have your burrito without the tortilla.  Don't expect table service.  What you get is glorified fast food.  The disadvantage is that you have to get your own meal in line.  The advantage is that you don't have to wait; and you get it exactly the way you want it.  The food is healthy.  Healthy; as in not full of chemicals.  It is still gonna have all the calories... maybe even a few extra; but  the meats are hormone and antibiotic free; the beans are organic; and the sour cream is hormone free too.  I don't eat the tortillas... i'm into the bowls.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,I am an avid Chipotle-er and I have been disappointed with this location on four separate visits! Dirty; slow line. One time the pico de gallo was so spicy I could barely eat it (and I like spicy!). They opened 10 minutes late one day and I spent my lunch break waiting for the doors to open... had to leave to make it back to work before I even got to order. During another visit; I waited five minutes for the fajitas to be made (they were close to raw!) on a Saturday around dinner time and watched the two people on the line bicker and mis-communicate through orders. The line stretched to the door. I was told the guacamole would take 20 minutes to make. No offer was made to make up for these shortcomings.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Chipotle is a godsend for my little area of Phoenix; where it seems quite difficult to eat vegetarian unless I cook at home. While there always seems to be a line out the door; it moves faster than you'd think. On top of that; the food is awesome! I have never once been disappointed with my food and neither has anyone that I have exposed Chipotle to. For having such a small and specific selection of items; the set-up is great and possibilities seem endless. I love that the meat served here is natural; meaning no hormones and better taste! The atmosphere is cozy; clean and simple.  The only reason I had to give this place only 4 stars is due to service. When you go thru the line and the staff asks you what what you would like on your salad; tacos or burrito; they ask as they are already spooning it on. On more than half occasions here they have had to remove ingredients or redo my food; but they never mind having to do the correction. So if you see a topping that you would prefer not to have; my advice is to scream it out before your food makes its way even remotely close to the item. I can promise you won;t be disappointed with your end result; though.......always yummy!,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Not much more to say other than it's CHIPOTLE. Service is great good is amazing and nice and fast. Perfect for a great on to go meal. Always an easy decision when one is around that I can stop by.,1
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,6 pm Friday night- out of hard shells!!! Wtf? Worthless. I refused to order anything else.  We drove here specifically because we love chipotle; but have never been to this location. Never again!,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,For a Chipotle it's on par.  The food is ok but inconsistent in portion size.  I have been here multiple times and I rarely get a consistent amount of food even though I usually order the same thing.  They have online ordering which is nice; BUT; it is rarely ready when I go to pick it up.  You still save time because they will make it while you are standing there avoiding the stares from everyone in line who has to wait.  I wish they would expand the menu a bit to include some of the soup items like QDoba has.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Terrible service. Workers were rude; thought i was lying; nothing else to say. Won't be coming back to this location.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Went on Tuesday night was waiting for a friend to fly in from Tampa. Her plane was late and  had some time to kill so went here since it was close to the hotel. I had the chicken burrito with pinto beans and rice. For a little extra I had the guacamole and it was worth it. A bag of chips; salsa; and a beer and I had the makings of a great dinner. I usually have the carnitas but the chicken tasted like it was fresh off the BBQ grill.  These burritos are huge! The service was great and the tables are clean. Check out this place when you are in the Metroplex area.,1
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,This is the first time I had been to any Chipotle; and I was not impressed. The girl only seemed to half listen and kept trying to rush me. Now; despite it being my first time; I already had an idea of what I wanted; since everyone at my internship eats there. So I knew what they had; but when I told her what I wanted she would either start to mess it up and I would repeat it again (always before she had a chance to put anything on it) and she acted exasperated that I wasn't just willing to take whatever she was about to put on it. Also; it was ok food; I won't rave about it but I didn't dislike it either. Better than some and for quick and convenient not bad. So I may try it again at another location; but definitely won't eat at that location again since I do not like being rushed to the point where I don't get what I want when ordering.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,The place has amazing food. Tacos. Burritos. Chips. All of it tastes great. The only thing holding me back from a 4 star review is that this place is a zoo at lunch time.  Yes every place is busy at lunch...as expected. But often this location has a line out the door. The food is good....but not that good. Try a pick up order if you are in a hurry.,0
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Fast service as usual; and they are always nice. The food tastes great and the prices are very good for what you get.,1
CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,When it comes to the quality of the food; all locations are the same... good. However; not all locations are equal in their level of service or consistency in product. This is by far the best location of the two other nearby. The people are friendly. We eat here often enough that many of the employees know it's and recognize us when we come in. They know what we order and are always pleasant. At most other locations you have to fuss at them to put more than five grains of five and two beans in your bowl; but not here. The only time they get a little stingy is when they are busy; so it is more out of being rushed than anything else. If you're coming for dinner you need to be here slightly before five or after seven. All other times there will be a considerable line.,0

0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Ordered delivery from these idiots; 1.5 hours later I call them and they haven't even started making it and are actually out of half the stuff I ordered. Sooo; you were just sitting there waiting for me to call you to tell me that? Zero stars.,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,The driver was unprofessional; and crumpled my receipt n put it in his pocket... No then I had to ask for it.  The pizza was purely cold. Did not look like any cheese was even on it. When I called to talk to a manager I was told that they are busy making pizzas to take an upset customers call. N I still never got to speak to one. I work in a pizza restaurant and I understand how it works. And I did not appreciate any if the service I was getting. I never have written a review before and they gave me every reason to.,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,"I wish I could give a ZERO STAR review for this place to further emphasize how much it is in your best interests to take your pizza craving to another business. To save you time: Skip this place.  There's a ton of other GOOD pizza places in this area that care about taking your order correctly.  Today I ordered a salad; a pizza; and a 2-Liter for myself and a co-worker.  We had never tried this place before and; since I like new things; I decided to go for it.  When I ordered; I did it with specific instructions: \no dressing for the salad\"" and \""pepperonis on all of the pizza; mushrooms only on one half.\""  I didn't want a pizza my co-worker couldn't eat (she doesn't like mushrooms).

Which wasn't high to begin with; mind you.  I immediately call back and make my list of complaints.  The guy who answered was the person who had taken my order; and tried to say that I had asked for one side to be mushrooms and pepperoni with the other side just cheese.  At no point had I even mentioned the *word* cheese during our conversation; and the fact that he tried to pin it on me pissed me off to no end.  That is a poor business model.

I've worked in the service industry for over 20 years.....  and can tell what's freshly made.

0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Pizza & Krispy Krunchy chicken is a lifesaver. I called last week for my sons birthday party of 150 people. It was all last minute thing. I called a day before; the birthday Party. They had great wings; Pizza was really good Kids loved it; definitely try there chicken salad. They arrived 20 minutes before the given time; which was great. We were all so hungry. I will order food from here next time. Price was very reasonable. The fact that it was also halal made it easy to pick out for our party.,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Ordered once and never again. Pizza was terrible! No flavor and it was burnt and cold when it arrived.,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Like some others; I wish zero stars was an option. This place is a kitchen nightmare episode at best. First of all they have a sign they are not serving any chicken except wings. No fried chicken of any kind. The guy at the register; who I think is an owner; explained you couldn't get the 40 wings option; but could order in increments of 20?!? Oh wait! That's so it will be more expensive. Since we have always liked the food from the Krispy Krunchy chicken on Buckeye we still gave it a chance. I paid; then the man went straight over and started making the food without washing his hands or using gloves. At one point he left and went to the liquor store next door then came back?? Still with a shred of hope it would be as good as the other location we waited. Final verdict-pizza was bland; wings had watered down sauce and I will never ever ever ever ever go back. Definitely worth the extra miles to go to the one in the WY market on Buckeye.,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Tried it while visiting Phoenix. MANNN I gotta say best fried chicken I have ever tried BEST EVER. Burgers specially the cheese philly steak OMG can't put it in words Trust me I wish I could just move near it. I have tried other locations in Chicago too but the staff there is super nice makes u feel like a king. Best ever customer service I have ever seen.,1
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,"Worst customer experience I have ever received from a restaurant. I work for a company that deals with Value Card Alliance and this place accepts our Valued Card scripts. However; you cannot place a order on the phone with Value Card. They will force you to go into their location to place an order due to past customers have complained about how long the wait is when ordering on the phone. Phone orders are so customers do not have to sit and wait at a location for their food. I asked to speak with the manager regarding this and the lady said \I'm in charge!\"" I asked her to explain why I can't order on the phone if using Value Card due to it is just like paying with cash. All the \""manager\"" said was \""people who use Value Card take too long to come pick up their orders and it is annoying to hear them complain about it being cold due to them not picking up on time.\"" If you are going to offer for phone orders and give a customer a time frame to pick it up; if the cost shows up after the time frame that is the customers fault. That does not mean you should deny a customer from ordering. Also when I told the \""manager\"" I'd just pay with cash then she was EXTREMELY rude on the phone. Never have I ever ordered from a restaurant and receive such poor customer experience. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!! If you want great pizza with great customer experience ESPECIALLY for a business that deals with Value Card I recommend you going to Rosati's Pizza on 40th St and Thomas. They take all orders on the phone and extremely friendly especially to businesses.""",0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Ok; this place is next to a liquor store and a check cashing place but despite the sketchy location; it's actually pretty good! Had the cheese pizza and an order of mixed bone in chicken with a honey biscuit. All for under 14 bucks! Can't beat that; right?,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Thank you; I almost ordered thru paypal. I'm glad when I called they did not answer; which led me to check yelp. The guy who gave 5 stars must work there. Thanks to all reviewers,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Pizza was avg. Wings were terrible; soggy and little sauce. This was our 1st time ordering and probably the last... unfortunate I was looking for something other than Pizza Hut. Oh well,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,"My fiancé and I ordered delivery from this place once. Once was all it took. The woman on the phone was lacking in customer service; and seemed almost rude to me for no reason. I had to spell out the street name that I live on four times before she understood. She took my order and told me it would be about forty five minutes. An hour later she called back and hung up on me. I called back and she told me she called to verify my address; yet again; but the delivery driver \knew where it was\"". Twenty minutes after; I called back and asked where my delivery was. I was informed it was \""on it's way\""; and hung up on. The delivery showed up almost an hour and a half after I placed my order. Surprisingly; the chicken was still warm; and tasted good; but the biscuits were lackluster at best; and relatively stale. I was very upset with the absolute lack of customer service and will never order from this place again.""",0

0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,I've ordered for delivery twice now and the fried chicken comes piping hot and super crunchy; so delicious! I've also had the beef samosas; curly fries/seasoned fries and fried corn on cob; all of which were so good! Pleasantly impressed by the quality considering the establishment's slightly questionable,0
0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,"there is no way this place is less than a 4; at least for chicken; that with biscuits and wedges. I can't talk about the pizza or other stuff; but you don't need to know about them. As soon as you try the chx; biscuits; and wedges; you won't order anything else. been here at least 5 times; never an \off day\""; always delicious.""",0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,after seeing them building it for months and reading the menu on their national website we were somewhat intrigued.  from appearances it reminded me of a similar place in the peoria/glendale area http://www.freddysfrozencustard.com/  which seems to adopt the chicago theme.  I found similar offerings at Culvers with the thin steak-burger style stacked burgers; which they call butterburgers; as well as frozen custard served ala DQ blizzard style which were similarly called concrete mixers.  I ordered a double mushroom swiss butterburger with cheese curds and a concrete mixer.  I found it interesting that they ask you what condiments you want on every sandwich.  I'm so used to just having the blanks penciled in for me that I was like a dear in headlights.  The food was pretty good; the burger was juicy and satisfying.  the cheese curds were good; I've had better at some bars but not bad for fast food. the custard was good but didn't seem quite on par with some of the other places that offer custard in the area.  all in all; it was a satisfying meal; and I would go back,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,So I was grumpy! I had to replace a blown tire on a busy morning at a Discount Tire in Surprise AZ where I live..why wait there when I could go next door to Culver's right? The tire rep told me it was awful and he hasn't been there in two years even though he works right next to it; but I needed to know for myself.      So first; I was welcomed by a lovely girl called Casey; whose last day will be today; and she guided me through the multiple options they had available. I settled on the 6 shrimps and one Atlantic cod; fries and coleslaw! I'll make this easy for everyone with a  1-10 scale okay? Shrimps: 7 Cod: 6 Fries: 8 Coleslaw: 9 Root beer: 8 Tartar sauce: 6 Seafood sauce: 6 Customer Service: 15      While I was finishing up my new experience; I was brought a free vanilla custard and then offered another custard sundae twenty minutes later....amazing place. They changed my grumpy; to giddy with kindness. Kudos!,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,"So it's the Saturday after Thanksgiving and all through the house  - BURGERS NOT TURKEY we all cried out! This place is close to my Mom's and allowed us an easy way to get some grub to go and allow the cook a day off. We hopped onto the website; made a list (checked it twice) for the 10 of us; and then three of us cruised over to make the order and pickup. OMG. I'm still dreaming of this place. Too bad it's a 5 hour drive....I could REALLY go for another burger from this place! My husband and I both indulged in the Culver's Bacon Deluxe; and everyone ordered a smattering of other burgers plus 8 orders of fries. We avoided the Cheese Curds because it seemed a lot of other reviewers weren't too pleased with them. Oh; there was also an order of onion rings but I didn't get to sample those. Our only \issue\"" if you will is that we requested all of the burgers be single patties and realized when we got home and unwrapped them all they were double patties - but don't worry - I still CAN'T BELIEVE I ATE THE WHOLE THING. It was SO good!!! I think there was only one in the group who felt his wasn't what we ordered ( hey; we went off of the list) but I was in seventh heaven. The place was more fast food-ish than I had pictured when we first walked in but I don't care; the food was delish and the service was pretty fast. My husband also split his chocolate malt with me which was very; VERY good. I guess I'll just keep dreaming of this burger until my next visit - but thank you Culver's for a delicious \""last meal\"" with the family before we hit the road that day to head home.""",1

_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,"I haven't had ice cream in months...well; real stuff.  I have had sugar free ice cream but not \the good stuff\"".  I ate kind of crappy today; so I thought I would let the party continue and get myself a real ice cream.  I stopped by here on my way home from the game.  I ordered a 2 scoop Turtle Sundae.  It was just under $5.00.  Paid the lady my money and they give you a number to take with you and keep on your table.  A few minutes later; they brought out my sundae.  Here is how it was..............  Turtle Sundae-  Just by the looks of it; I knew it was going to be fantastic.  This thing was 2 scoops of vanilla custard; caramel sauce; hot fudge; pecans and a cherry on top.  The first I noticed when I dug in were the pecans.  Good lord they hook them up.  Every single bite had a grip of toasted pecans in them.  They were crunchy; salty and flat out delicious.  They don't skimp on them; that's for sure!  The hot fudge and caramel sauce were mixed in well and the custard was cool and creamy.  It was pretty much a perfect sundae.  I was sad when the spoon hit the bottom of the cup.  I don't know how often I will be back...I need to get back on the wagon of my low carb plan this week.  Their food options look decent too.  I do know one thing though....  If I ever need a sundae; I know where I'm coming for one.  It's only about 5 miles from my house and I really enjoyed the combo of flavors; especially those pecans...they were the star of the show.  The girls working the counter were friendly too.""",1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Wow; we stopped there  and it smells like urine; like dirty diapers that have been sitting for a couple of days that need to be thrown out.  I wanted to leave; the person I was with wanted to stay and eat; so we toughed it out.  It wasn't  pleasant at all; it was that nursing home smell mixed with urine.  Gross.   Our food was ok; the fries were nice and hot; very good; the burger was very very thin; pretty sure they don't use real bacon at least that's what it seems like; also very thin.    We ordered some concretes; I have to say I'll never get one of those again; my turtle concrete had pecans and ice cream. I expected it to have caramel and chocolate but there wasn't any at all; nor were there any pecans in the bottom half of the cup; only near the top.   It was like someone put the pecans in; gave it a little stir and served it.  Very disappointing; and certainly nowhere near another place we can the same product; only much better.  $25.00 for the both of us.  A little high for not so great food. I don't think we will visit there anytime soon; especially after the stench we experienced today.,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Took our friends from California. They wanted to try a place not in California. I had heard about Culvers.. We ordered and the burgers are excellent. Our friends and my family where both very impressed. Service was very.good. This was a place I would uo against any California hamburger jpint!,1

_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Another chain joins the ranks out in Surprise and I have to say this one is pretty good. Ive been to the one in Mesa and it was lackluster. Though now some time has passed and I went ahead and tried the same things I ordered last time. Double Deluxe Butterburger; Dairyland Cheese Curds and a Chocolate Concrete Shake.   The burger was juicy though not really discernible considering the butter angle; but tasty none the less as well as fresh and hot. The cheese curds; well I just wish they were just cheese curds plain; rather than battered and deep fried. The chocolate shake was so thick that the straw was pretty much worthless.. pretty tasty when using a spoon. Advice; drop the fried cheese curds into the chocolate shake and eat that way; better than ranch!!   All in all; kind of boring but pretty solid. Next time Id like to try the fried chicken.. crispy and juicy chicken makes me moist every time!!,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,My first thought:  What a strange mix of a menu!  There's butterburgers (what they're famous for); fried chicken; fish; tuna melts; cheesesteaks; salads....and then their other claim to fame; the frozen custard.  I tried the mushroom swiss burger which was very juicy; and the meat had an interesting texture - moist on the inside; slightly crisp on the outside.  The bun was very buttery.  I tried a little of the chili cheese fries; which were pretty tasty and generous...and also tried some of the cheese curds.  I liked the seasoning on the curds and liked that they used two different cheeses.  They were a ton better than those at A&W in my opinion.  Just a warning though; the burgers are so big and filling; there's not a lot of room left in the tummy for sides.  I was SO full.  The custard is smooth and silky; and I'm afraid to say Culver's may give Ritters a bit of competition.    You can get a quart for $5.99.  Every other quart you buy after that first one only costs you $3 each.  The price is extremely reasonable.  I was interested in the fact that you can get what they call regular sides and premium sides.  Anything from regular fries to sauteed green beans.  I don't think I ever had green beans with a hamburger...  Prices are pretty decent; and the staff seems very friendly and motivated.  I didn't see one person just sitting idly.  We'll see if this place stands the test of time; I hope the best for them.  So far I'm liking this place far better than the M or the box; especially in terms of service.,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Okay; I was super excited about this place when I finally realized what it was while we were in the drive-through.  I wasn't excited however about their complicated menu.  I did the build your own combo thing and I just wanted a single patty cheeseburger with bacon on it.  I got the cheese curds as a side because... well how could I not.  Fried cheese.  After pulling past the pay window we waited for a good 7-10 minutes for our food.  That was irritating.  I like the whole made-to-order thing; but Jack In the Box manages to do it faster.  I gobbled up all my cheese curds within moments.  Ya; they were really good.  There was a mix of white and yellow cheese in there.  The flavor of them was just delicious.  Unfortunately; my burger was all sorts of wrong.  I opened the wrapping to find a ridiculously misshapen double cheeseburger inside.  I wanted one less patty and some bacon.   I guess that was too much to ask.  Anyway; it looked unappetizing based off of the strangely shaped patties and the fact that it was so greasy I couldn't get my hands to grip it without crap falling out the other end.  I probably wouldn't go back unless I was just getting a snack.  The cheese curds are great; but that's about it.,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Based on one slightly unfair visit due to an unruly 3yr old demanding ice cream.   I ordered 'two of those on the picture out the front'; meaning the scrumptious looking specimens on the boards before you enter. Unfortunately; the cashier didn't quite know what I meant - my own fault for not being specific I guess......but then what was served-up were two plops of 'frozen' custard (strawberry and chocolate) - there were supposed to be m&m's in both; but we ended up with double in the chocolate - with that much in the pot; it was inedible (nearly broke a tooth); whilst the strawberry version was a tasteless mess. I didn't have time to have a famous burger; and the frozen custard was not really what I was expecting.....  Decor was nice for a chain; sport on the tv was a plus. Maybe next time I'll have more time to sample other stuff; and will change the scoring appropriately.,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,OMG!  I had the caramel cashew frozen custard!  I would give up Fenton's black and tan for this. Yes; you heard me right!  The cashews are bit salted so you get that salt and sweet taste.  This past weekend I went to the a place that served frozen custard in Willow Glen and it didn't EVEN come close.      *Chicken cashew salad - grilled to order chicken; sugar snap peas; grape tomatoes; cucumbers; iceberg lettuce and spring greens.  This THE best fast food salad I ever had.  *Fish and chips - It's the BEST fish and chips I every had - even compared to a restaurant!  The batter wasn't thick.  It was light and crispy and not oily.  The fish was soooo juicy and moist.  It wasn't fishy at all.    Tried the Culver's in Phoenix and it wasn't as nearly as good.  I can't wait until I go to back !!!!,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,We come here solely for their custards.  It's delicious and quite caloric.  Did  I say delicious?  Good service; too.  Very polite staff.  The rest of their food is OK.  Probably more like 3 stars but I generally am not a fan of fast food.,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Long wait; and bland burgers. Decided to check this places out after passing by it 12 dozen times. I was not really impressed with the service; the food; or the atmosphere. The prices were a bit on the high side for a fast food joint as well.,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Went with my family on a Friday night out and decided to give culver's a try since I had just won a coupon on their Facebook site for a free fish sandwich. We waited for 20 minutes in line and then come to find out the manager refuses to accept it as a coupon. He gives a made up excuse that they aren't a participating store and laughs in my face. Of all people you would think the manager would know how to treat customers with respect and kindness. We left after publicly being humiliated and went to sonic for dinner instead. I hope culver's corporate learns how to better train their managers in customer service because the surprise store sure needs the help.,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,I'd give this place 10 stars if I could! It's such a refreshing change from all the norms. The service is always exceptional; the food is fresh and tasty. There is a huge variety; so everyone is happy. They make their own root beer; which they combine with their custard to make a heavenly root beer float. I'd go here hands down; every time; given the alternatives here in Surprise.,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,First time here....Kind of like a souped up Dairy Queen from up north. Bacon cheddar Burger was as good a burger as I've had; cooked perfectly and the Custard/ice cream was delicious. Definately a fan of this establishment. Priced right with good service and very clean as well.,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,"I don't mind the ol' Culvers. The food is indeed incredibly greasy and unhealthy so those on a diet should completely avoid it; and for others it should DEFINITELY be a very rare treat. However; it tastes pretty good. I myself would rank it above Five Guys; but below In-N-Out. Fries are okayish; but I'm a big fan of their bacon deluxe burger. The place is clean and has a lot of space inside. Has a very high snowbird factor during the winter months; but then again what place this close to Sun City doesn't? Kid loves the cheese butterburger and the fact that with every kids meal you get a free voucher for a scoop of their custard.  Went here on the weekend. Service reasonably fast at the counter and they bring the meal out to you. However; this particular time; when I went back to the counter to get the free scoop of custard there was nobody serving. I waited there tapping my foot for about 2 mins or longer before the fry chef behind the rear window called to me to check if I was being attended to. I said no and he said someone would be with me shortly. Servers came and went behind the counter. Eventually a gent who I assumed was the manager on duty strode behind the counter and asked if someone was helping me. I said no and he briefly looked exasperated before he took the order (politely). Placed the order; went back to my table to wait. Five mins later; still no custard (usually it's out in a min or two). Same guy is passing by; and goes \Nobody's brought your custard out yet?!\"" I said no meekly. He goes \""AARGH! I'm so sorry about this!\"" and strides back to the kitchen area. Comes out seconds later with my custard; apologises for the tardiness and gives me a little token for a free scoop that I can use anytime. Nice gesture. This was a one-off and such things happen - the place certainly isn't as shitapple as the McDonalds a couple hundred yards west - but I must admit I was surprised that nobody was stationed permanently behind the counter. They need to vet their teenagers a little better during the hiring process I'm thinking; and not give the order-takers anything else to do except take orders. Anyway; a solid 3 stars.""",1

_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Really an ordinary burger ; where's the meat on a single? The chili fries were horrible chili paste! The curds were so dry and mostly breading! I have to say I did like the shake so will return for ice cream only! The girl who brought food brought no shakes when I asked her for them she looked like we did not order them then returned with one when I said 2 she had to look on the receipt to be sure I wasn't lying to her! The place was so busy I thought it was going to be good that many people can't be wrong about the burgers can they! What a disappointment I am a big advocate for trying new places but this one does not get my vote!,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Ok so I thought I would give the place a try... Got a double Swiss mushroom burger ; onion rings and chocolate shake... Well I went thur the drive thru no one there so I thought I would be in and out pretty quick... The wait time wasn't to bad; got my order and preceded to leave; I stuck my hand in the bag and what do ya know..no onion rings...so now I have to inconvenience myself and go in and get  what should have been there in the first place...  So I get to my destination to eat my meal and let's just say I have had a much better burger for the money... I mean no letter; onion; tomato or sauce really???? I payed over $11 dollars for this meal for two hamburger patties and some cheese ???? Really....oh wait there was suppose to be mushrooms on it too but I didn't see much of them either..  The onion rings; standard onion rings you could get at burger king...the shake was good but everything else;well not so good ...   I won't spend that kind f money on fast food drive thru; I will go to Red Robin where they know how to make a real meal...,0
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Fast service.  Friendly staff. Great food ... and thats an understatement!,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,I'm from the Midwest; so when I heard that Culver's was coming to AZ I got very excited!!! This is a new location located in Surprise; AZ; and I recently had the chance to go inside and check out the new flat screen TVs and nice employees! The shakes and butter burgers are absolutely amazing. I've visited many times through the drive-thru and there is a little bit of a wait to get your food after you've ordered. Don't forget to check out the cheese curds...they are so yummy!,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,If you're looking for a great tasting burger; then this is the place to stop into!   Conveniently located in Surprise with lots of parking.  Restaurant was clean except for some tabletops and small in my opinion (-1).  Staff are welcoming and friendly.  Service is fast. Menu is extensive so take a while to decide what you want! Their burgers are great - tasty; filling; juicy; and cooked to perfection.  They even butter the outside of the bread which makes it even more tastier.  Fries are good - fresh and hot. Their concrete mixers it would seem is their specialty with about 19 flavors from what I counted.  I wouldn't compare it to DQ's Blizzard but it's right up there and it's really tasty. Definitely will be coming back here to try some of the other varieties on the menu including other concrete mixer drinks....so addicting!,1
_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,I normally come here if there's nowhere else to go in surprise. Their intercom in the drive through does not work you basically have to scream and the window girl (Kristen) was extremely rude. Basically throwing out change at us and rushing the drinks out the window my husband almost dropped them. Definatly not worth my time or money anymore. I'll never go here after today. Hate terrible customer service sorry culvers,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"This is the favorite burger of our Commander-in-Chief; so who am I as a lowly tax-paying foot soldier to question the restaurant? As the fattest nation on Earth; this burger must shine as a golden example to the reason. The cheeseburger that I ordered could have easily fed a Somalian village and walking back to the light rail I am sure my already high blood pressure shot several points higher. I pray I finish this review before I succumb...  I wouldn't recommend ordering the burger with tomatoes. Not that they were bad; but they create a sliding factor that detracts from the dining experience. There are two options - wear half of the burger on your shirt or wolf it down in an attempt not to wear said burger and as a result fail to be able to enjoy the dining experience.  The price of the meal is a little higher than most; but so are the portions. As I described; the burger is enormous; and I ordered a regular size fry. The fries are served in a paper cup and more fries dumped in the sack. Really it was overkill because by the time I engulfed the burger; I really didn't want any fries - but this is a review about the whole meal so for you; dear reader; I pushed on ever so slightly. The fries are good - Cajun flavor and spicy. Good - yes. \The best\"" as the advertisements proclaim? I wouldn't say so. In comparing Five Guys to another recently opened gourmet burger joint; SmashBurger's rosemary fries are far superior. Five Guys outranks SmashBurger In terms of dining room size and available seating. Plenty of place to sit and attempt not to wear the burger.   One thing I found as a huge distraction was the music. I don't want to sound like an old man; but turn that damn thing down! The radio was so loud it wasn't a pleasant experience. When you are trying to inhale a large cow cooked in 100% peanut oil; talking to your dining companion leaves limited opportunities. Say a few words and dive back in. What makes it annoying and difficult is that when you masterfully pull off this move; the partner continually says \""huh?\"".   Overall the burger was good and tasted grilled from the backyard. I know this will lose me points for being a fat guy and probably further lower my man-card status; but I don't think there needs to be two patties - one would suffice. The fries are too much too. I couldn't even finish the overflow in the bag; let alone touch the ones in the actual cup. For $11 for a burger; fries and drink ($5.59 burger; $2.59 regular Cajun fries; $2.19 large Cherry Coke)I felt like I wasted the fries and was so uncomfortable after gorging on the burger that I didn't enjoy the experience. Dare I say a smaller version of the meal would probably be a good opportunity for a future menu option.""",0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Ive only been here once; but it'll probably be my last. Nothing special about this place. I ordered a burger; fries and a coke and it cost me around $10. The food was good; but if im paying over 10 bucks for a burger combo i want a happy ending before i walk out the door. I would suggest trying it once and see if you fall in love with the place; but for me; its not worth the price. i would just as soon go to in n out.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I mean; it's good; but I wouldn't say that it is \all that!\""  The atmosphere is wonderful; prolly the reason I stayed with 4 stars instead of 3.  They employees are lively using fun voices to announce the pick-up numbers and are happy to assist with anything you may need.  The customer service aspect is top notch and they are happy to put all the fixings on your burgers for you.  Everything is a la carte so be prepared; it's on the pricey side.  I got a Bacon Cheeseburger and medium soda and it was $9.00.    Cajun fries are over-seasoned; but that's why I liked them so much.  The cajun seasoning was uber-delicious and so salty that it kept me going back for more.   Also; they have Mello-Yellow...yeah; I know; AWESOME!!  There are free peanuts; good food; and a fun atmosphere.  I went here with some friends after an ASU home game and enjoyed it.  Like I mentioned earlier; it's good; but it's not the best I've ever had.""",1
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I was not overly impressed with 5 guys.  We have only been to this place one time.  The guy who took our order was impatient and unfriendly when we asked questions about the menu.    My burger was extremely wet which caused the entire thing to fall apart making it impossible to eat.  I also don't understand why they tell you that you can have anything that you want on your burger; but give such skimpy amounts.  ONE mushroom on a burger does not count as a topping.    I agree that the fry order is strange.  It's fine for two people to share; but I can't imagine going solo for lunch and ordering such a massive amount of fries.    I don't get the whole peanuts-in-a-burger-joint thing.......peanuts and burgers?  Prices are a bit on the higher side for such typical burgers.  Can't get out of there for under $10 person.  If the burgers were fantastic; I wouldn't mind the pricing; but they aren't that great.    Smashburger will continue to get my business over 5 Guys.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I'll admit that I hadn't heard of 5guys before Obama hailed them as his favorite burger. Nonetheless; I was impressed. Great location; plenty of seating and an efficient process.   I ordered the \little\"" burger and let me assure you; this is plenty big! A really good size burger with your choice of toppings. I got all the standards; minus the onions. Shared a regular fries with a coworker and there were still left overs. Really enough fries for three ppl. I really enjoyed my meal here; and they get kudos for great drink selections (sprite zero anyone?!?)   Oh; and they have all you can eat free peanuts too!""",1
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,After a pleasant experience at Five Guys in North Scottsdale; I decided to swing by the Tempe location after work for some quick; greasy food.   Parking: Might be ok if you live right there and can walk over; but it was a bit of a hassle to take a couple spins around the area to find a parking spot.  Ordering: How does small bacon cheeseburger w/ everything on it turn into a plain cheeseburger with drink? Yeah; people make mistakes; but I like to think I'm eating a little healthy w/ some veggies tucked in between the buns.   Fries: If there's any reason to go to Five Guys; it's for the fries. Now I don't know if this is standard practice; but the fry guy at North Scottsdale loaded up a small cup with fries; then placed the cup into a paper sack; then filled the paper sack with fries (which can only be described as awesome). However; this practice doesn't seem to carry over to Tempe.   Quite disappointing; I'll be going to In-N-Out next time.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,My girlfriend and I hit this place up during the Horror & Sci-Fi Film festival this weekend.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and she picked up a regular cheese burger with onions and mushrooms.  ..also grabbed a small fry.  I gotta say the taste of these burgers are absolutely delicious.  Just juicy as can be.  The fries are great too; but I recommend getting the small.. plenty of food.  I loved that all the condiments are free to put on the burger.  My only gripe is that they dont tell you how big the burgers are.  After getting our food; we both realized that we could have split one big burger or each have gotten a jr burger.    Loved the taste of this place and would most definitely go back here and chow down.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,An alright burger joint with peanuts galore.  They use peanut oil for everything. I ordered a hamburger; reg Cajun fries; and reg drink; totaling at $10.   Result; I got a burger with double hand made patties with onions mushrooms pickles etc sandwiched with a sesame seeded set of buns. Reminds me of well crafted homemade burger. It was good but for the price in and out burgers knocks five guys out of the competition. Delicious regardless and I'd eat again.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Today I had my 1st experience with 5 Guys and was hugely disappointed. I ordered my bacon cheeseburger (plus 5 toppings since they are all free) and fries and waited in anticipation of my delicious meal. Not only did I have to wait 30 minutes for my order to be ready for me to take with me to eat (since I ordered it to go) but when I had my 1st bite I realized that they only placed 2 toppings on the burger (forgot the other 3) and forgot the bacon that I paid extra for. To say the least I was hugely disappointed and went on to tell all my co-workers what a huge let down it was. I would have walked back and asked them to fix my order but since I didn't have another 30 minutes to wait for 5 Guys to attempt to make it correctly I tossed what I was given.  I do not anticipate that I will ever eat at 5 guys again since I have another burger place (i.e. Fatburger) to choose from that can get my order right that is only a few steps further from my place of work. Thanks for ruining my lunch 5 Guys and for charging me extra for nothing!!!,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I really want to give this place four stars. Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger; fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes.   Granted the burger is juicy perfection; grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star; especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were; I would probably be a bit more accommodating; but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.  I do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger; for the wimps like me out there. Regardless; I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place; because they're seriously too good to get away.   The french fries are also in the style that I like; freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.  I also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there; but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly; that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it.   Alright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star. Damn your scrumptious fare; Five Guys. Your hypnotic grease has me entranced.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys is pretty new on the scene on Mill and fits in very well with the college style and crowd that it will cater to.  This place is by no means a gourmet restaurant; but they put out decent food at a decent price. The inside is very well lit and very clean with white tiled walls with red highlights and free peanuts for snacking on.  Service is quick and friendly with food being made as it is ordered. My burger was well cooked; but not dry and overdone; well prepared and still juicy.  The toppings are very fresh and can be picked to suit with a large variety.  Being able to just pick and choose your toppings to your heart's desire is kind of a neat aspect of this place and gives the customer the ability to customize their burger.  The fries were the weakest part of the meal since they were a bit on the soggy side and left room for improvement.  I did like the choice of regular fries or cajun; which gave the fries a bit more flavor and taste and actually bumped up fries a bit.  However; I really like my fries to be a bit more crispy and less soggy/limp.,1

0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I'm not sure who the 5 guys are; nor do I care; but on my way to the airport we dropped in for a quick (10 minute) bite before hitting the jet stream.  Damn; didn't we just eat In N Out like 3 hours ago? Yeah; but they serve Hot Dogs here. Yea! Okay; so I wasn't helping my diet any; but hey; I'm on vacation. No; not really; but whatever.  One hot dog please! What would you like on it? BACON! and?... Wow; tons to choose from!!! I'll have onions; mustard and JALAPENOS!  My friends ordered a burger and a grilled cheese and I sat back and watched as the \guys\"" made all our food from scratch.  Everything was tasty and the fries were IMHO perfect. The price was good; the portions good; the staff were good and the place was clean.  Yup; I'd do it again""",1
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys opened on Mill today in the old Coffee Plantation location.  The place was bright; loud and busy. I was immediately impressed with how many people they had working; I counted 14 just behind the counter. They had classic rock playing so loud you could barely hear them call out order numbers and the people behind the counter were yelling and laughing. It's a pretty fun experience for lunch.  I ordered the little bacon cheeseburger; cajun fries and regular drink. The burger was decent (not In and Out quality; but pretty good). I really liked that they let you load up on your choice of toppings (I got grilled onions; mushrooms; lettuce; tomato and pickles) they also had green peppers; jalapeno peppers; bbq and A1 sauce. I was a little disappointed with the price as $10.24 seemed a bit high.   They didn't have shakes  which was a major let down. All in all it was pretty good; but not much better than Fat Burger which is just down the block on Mill. I'll be interested to see how they far in the long run.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I love five guys. I eat at the Las Vegas locations 1-2 times a week.  I was excited to find a Five Guys on Mill.  If you are looking for just a plain; simple burger and none of the fancy extras that high end burger joints offer; this is the spot.  A great tasting meat burger; no special or creative toppings to make the burger.   I couldn't give it five stars overall; even though the burger was great.  My two knocks are; the store was dirty. I'm not referring to all the peanut shells on the floor (you can grab peanuts and eat them while you wait for your burger to be cooked). But almost all the tables were dirty. I actually had to clean my own table.  And the employee atmosphere was dead. The Las Vegas locations are rowdy and upbeat; full of energy the second you walk in. They greet you; they give orders  amongst themselves that is loud but upbeat.  That was missing from here at Mill Ave.  But don't let the small stuff that can be corrected overnight stop you from eating here.  What can't be fixed is their great tasting burger.  Add a milkshake machine and this joint will give In N Out a run for its money!  Plain and simple; Five Guys is a must try!,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I have now tried the three new burger chains that have moved into the Tempe area.  Five Guys; Smashburger and Fatburger.  Five Guys was the worst of the three.  $11 for a burger; fries and drink!  The burger fell apart when I picked it up and didn't taste that good.  The fries had the most burnt pieces of fries in an order of fries I have ever had/seen.  (I worked in fast food in my youth and would never had given out this order of fries to a customer.)  The drink was colored water.  I went for ice tea at the self serve drink area and tried two different types of ice tea and both were like drinking water.  I should have expected that as a light on the ice tea machine was flashing and I saw employees look at it but just walk away.  Also; one of the two ice/soda machines had a sign taped on it advising customers to use the other machine.  (This location is pretty new and I saw an armoured car make a pickup while I was there.  Well at the prices they charge; no surprise at how much money they are taking in.  Perhaps Five Guys would like to take some of that money and fix the ice tea and the one ice/soda machine.)  I didn't even go during the lunch or dinner rush; 2:00 p.m.!  Also; after I paid for my order; I selected a small table and left some napkins and a copy of a weekly newspaper that I planned to read while eating on the table.  I then went to get my colored water (ice tea) and went back to my table to wait for my order to be called.  When I returned to my table; my napkins and newspaper were gone!  Yes; I found the newspaper in the trash can by the table.  A couple of employees were cleaning tables in the area and had seen me put my stuff on the table and I even said \Excuse me.\"" to them as I squeezed by them on the way to the ice tea machine.  I didn't mention that the burger came with two patties; it doesn't state that and I would have gone with a one patty burger since that is what I thought I was ordering and it would have (and should have) been cheaper.  Did I also mention the lettuce was pale (almost white) and the fries that weren't burnt weren't that great?  Smashburger and Fatburger do burgers and fries better.""",0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I just don't get this place....what do peanuts have to do with burgers and fries?  Besides the odd addition of peanuts; the menu is very basic like an In and Out Burger....but about 3 times the price!  The menu doesn't say anywhere that the regular burger has 2 patties....which would be helpful when ordering for someone that isn't trying to practice for a food eating competition!  The burgers tasted good; but they weren't anything special that I would go back for.  Besides; two burgers and a side of fries was $20...there are much better burgers out there with comparable prices.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,For a place that's supposed to be all about great burgers; at least this location falls far short of the mark. I ordered a little bacon cheese burger and fries (as an aside; I find it annoying that they only offer one size of fries; not on an economic level - as the cost for the size they offer is reasonable; but on a wasteful level as sometimes I just want some dries and not a pound of fries). Needless to say; after a reasonable wait; I got my food and upon opening the wrapper; found the bun waterlogged and shriveled as if it had been made some time ago. I'm mot sure how this could be however; as I ordered a specific set of toppings which seemed to be present. Anyhow; with the first bite; the Burger self-destructed and left me with a burger-salad I was forced to eat like an animal. The ingredients; except the horrible bun which caused the whole problem; were good and fresh; and the fries - although too numerous; were great. I have been to another five guys location in the area and this was not my experience there. This location needs to fix a few things to get it right; and the average three stars I saw on their overview probably gets it about right. Maybe this sort of sloppy preparation works for a $10 lunch for a college kid; but for me it was unacceptable.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,It's probably a good thing that I don't live closer to a Five Guys....  I am in love with their fries!!  They are delicious!  I order the regular size and even it is too big.  Not only do they fill the cup; but then they also fill the brown bag that the cup of fries is poured into!  This is the first place where I saw the cool soda machine that I've now seen in a few other places.  But I love that you can pick your own drinks from so many different flavors!  Although; I get cherry sprite every time!  Yum!!!  Every time I have been here; there's always been good seating and everything has been clean.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit overpriced.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,So since everyone is comparing this place to In-N-Out I will base my review on a comparison of the two.  1. the atmosphere. Pretty similar to In-N-Out. It's got a classic burger joint kinda feel. Although it's very loud. Some coworkers and I went at lunch and we had a hard time hearing each other. It was very busy and the music was cranked.   2. the burger. Okay; so it is more expensive than In-N-Out but it's much bigger. I got the small and it was still a pretty thick patty plus you get all the toppings you want. I like that there are so many options so you can customize your burger. I got mine with cheese; lettuce; tomato and mayo. I thought the meat was flavorful; the veggies were fresh and the bun was fresh too.  3. the fries. WAY better than In-N-Out. I've never really understood why people think the fries at In-N-Out are so great. Yeah; they're fresh but I think they are a little bland. Five Guys fries are also fresh but have a much better flavor. They are cut much bigger and the portion is huge! We each ordered our own fries (all of us were Five Guys virgins) and not one of us finished the order. One guy ordered a large and it was insane. The five of us probably could have shared a large. Or at least a large and a small. We threw away so many fries it was redonkulous.   Overall; my group left Five Guys stuffed and satisfied. I think it's just as good as In-N-Out if not better because of their awesome fries.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,eh.  first of all; this place had been hyped up to me by a couple of people(hubby included) for several days. add that to the fact that parking on Mill's a b*tch; and you will realize why this was such a let-down for me.  now; we'll begin with the pros: *free peanuts while you wait *delicious cajun fries *malt vinegar  ...that's about it.  the burger was kind of dry and; I suspect; would have been about as good as; say; McDonalds; had I not added my plethora of toppings. the service took forever(and it was nearly empty in there); and their sh*t is EXPENSIVE.  Lenny's; in Glendale; has them beat. hands down.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,My dining partner and I ended up here for lunch because our original destination was closed. After ordering; we dove into the unlimited free peanuts.. so far so good. However; once we got into the burger and fries; our experience began to go downhill.   Maybe it's unfair; but I compare every burger I eat to In-N-Out. This cheeseburger just didn't measure up. It wasn't bad; but not great either. We also shared an order of the Cajun fries; which weren't anything special. The worst was right after we finished eating. My dining partner and I both had the feeling you get when you eat junk food that didn't even satisfy you; but instead leaves you feeling crappy.    Another thing- I spent $5 for a cup of water and a small cheeseburger. I could get a cheeseburger; fries and a small drink at In-N-Out for the same price.   Needless to say; I will not be returning to Five Guys.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Their cheeseburgers are pretty tasty; and I just tried a hot dog the other day and it was actually really delicious! Their fries are good; I wish they had a smaller size considering I have to throw half of them away if I'm eating alone. It would also be nice if they didn't make every order to go; it's kind of a waste of paper...,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Great Burger!! comparable to In-n-Out. the fries are fresh and very tasty. A small order of fries was good enough for two people.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I've been to Five Guys twice now; first on opening day when I got a small burger; fries and a drink for $10.  I thought the burger was very good.  I liked it better then In 'N Out just because of the toppings.  I like more of an exotic burger and Five Guys had plenty of toppings to choose from that made it just the way I like it.  The cajun fries were very good; but they give you way too many.  I'd rather see a smaller portion for less money.    Yesterday I went again and this time ordered a Cheese Hot Dog.  The hot dog was very good; Kosher; cut down the middle and grilled.  The cheese was a slice of American cheese which was better then the liquid crap most places use; but better yet would have been grated cheese.  I also got grilled onions; mushrooms; and jalepenos on top; but didn't get many toppings; maybe because of the limited space on a hot dog; but a little disappointing.  Overall I think it's really good and I would have given it a high rating if it was a little cheaper and if they used grated cheese.  Everyone working there was very friendly and love the classic rock music they play.,1
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Good; fast service; and the place is always clean.  It's a little expensive for fast food though.,1
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"The pros definitely outweigh the cons; but let's start with the cons just because it's more fun.  1. The scary tweakers RIGHT outside. Real entertaining to watch through the windows at first; but I noticed a lot of children in the restaurant staring out there; and heard one say she was scared; so that's no fun for anybody. But; because that has nothing to do with Five Guys as a company; only their scary surroundings; I didn't take away any stars for that. I just wanted to mention it because I'd want someone to mention it to me. :)  2. I took away the star because there is something fundamentally wrong with the french fries. I know there's lots of mixed reviews in the commentary; but I can only speak for myself when I say that I did not enjoy them at all. Neither did my friend who joined me.  But there's lots of pros!  1. Super fast service. I think our food was ready in less than a couple minutes.   2. Lots of seating. Seating everywhere; I can't even imagine the place ever filling to capacity.  3. The burgers really are the shizzle. I had a bacon cheeseburger; and it was quite delicious. I think the buns are \butter buns\"" and the burgers are made right there when you order them so they're super fresh.  4. There's a pretty dope coke machine that distributes a plethora of teas; lemonades; sodas; you name it.  Not much else to say... it's a burger joint. :)""",1

0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I am going to keep this short and not so sweet. First there wasn't 5 guys; there was 3 guys and a girl.  Ok my attempt at humor might have failed but so did this place in my book. I spent 15 dollars on 2 burgers and 1 regular fry; way to much if you ask me.   They screwed up my order; twice. The first time I ordered a bacon burger with cheese all the free toppings minus the mushrooms; they put mushrooms on.  I sent it back and also asked them to leave off the gross; processed slop that they were trying to pass off as cheese. Also the first burger was a sloppy; soggy mess from the moment I opened the foil that it was wrapped in. When I went back to the counter I went over my order; slowly; thinking it would be right.  Since everyone had already eaten I took it to go without checking it; another mistake on my part.  They left off the mushrooms this time but forgot the bacon.  You think they would have given my burger special attention since they screwed it up the first time; nope. I try to stay away from chain restaurants anyway; give my money to locally owned establishments; and this experience has solidified that notion.  I will stick with Lobby's thank you.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,This visit was my first to 5 Guys and it was pretty okay. I have heard the In n Out/5 Guys comparisons and I am on team InO but I always welcome a competing burger. Ordering was pretty simple. I had a little bacon cheeseburger with some basic toppings and cajun style fries. It took a little while for our food to come out; which was a sign of them making it fresh as you can see into the kitchen. The fries were okay (I did enjoy the cajun option); the burger was okay - neither blew me away; especially for the price; but I wouldn't object to coming back.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,i'd never heard of this place and we thought we'd give it a try.  i accidentally ordered a bacon buger (2 patties) with relish because i thought it came with all the default toppings; but it only came with relish.  when i took it back; the staff was nice but the owner/manager was visibly dickish about it.  the new burger i got ended up being a single patty and they said i could keep the old one.  so of course i combined and now had a triple decker.  and i pounded that bad boy.  it was awesome.  the cajun fries are also outstanding- very big fries.  i only wish this place had shakes.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,very good Burger and fries. Burgers and fries made to order. they give you alotta fries! but its about 10-12 buck to get burger fries and drink. way better than any fast food burger including in and out. good stuff a must stop if you like burgers and fries! and its on mill so no free or easy parking on weekdays,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"Below is a general review of the two AZ locations I have been to; and at the bottom will be notes specific to this location...  This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.  But if you like a burger that was made when you order it or fries that are real potatoes and don't taste like the cup they came in then this place could be a great option.  They are a little pricier than your average quick service joint; but its worth it.  The portions are HUGE; even if you order the \regular\"" fries and the \""little\"" burger they are still BIG.  They don't charge per topping beyond the norm like Smashburger; and they have tons of toppings to choose from.  Would love to see a fried egg option; but other than that the majority of burger loving taste buds will find topping options that please them.  They have some non-burger choices as well; which is nice.  Hot dogs; grilled cheese (which people keep saying is a must try) and a veggie sandwich.  Eating here is a 5 napkin type experience; a lil messy; a lil crazy; but oh so yummy!  Hint: if you are transporting 5 guys in your car; definitely put something between the bag and your (clothes; passenger seat; floor mat; etc..)  the grease WILL leak through the bag.   I agree with a below post that the placement of peanut snacking boxes are a little awkward  (and frankly I don't get why they exist at all; but whatever)  TEMPE Location Specific:  Could have just been the day I was here; but their Mr. Pibb tastes better than most places... who knows; perhaps they clean the machine well!  Parking is a bit of a challenge; it is on mill ave so it is meter parking and limited meter parking.  Mostly parallel; but next to American Apparel there are some standard metered spots as well.  Regardless; make sure you have change if you will be parking to go to grab your burger!""",0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"Below is a general review of the two AZ locations I have been to; and at the bottom will be notes specific to this location...  This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.

0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Finally an able competitor to IN & OUT burger! The burgers are a good size and come with all the toppings you would ever want. Their sweet Potato fries are delicious and the portion is soo big that I can usually convince a friend to order them and then steal 1/2 of theirs :)   Despite this place being busy during lunch; they usually have my order ready within 5-10 minutes.   I still like IN & OUT burgers better but this place gives it a run for the money.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"Went there on opening day today for lunch as well.  I concur that it was slam-diggity but super well-staffed.  I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly we got in & out on opening day AND it was also the 1st day of the Tempe Festival of the (F)Arts; so it was extra crowded on Mill Ave today.  I have to say I'm stoked there's a new lunch option within 2 minutes walk of my office.  Since the dirty Uno's closed on Halloween my walkable lunch options have been reduced to LaBoca (which I prefer/reserve for drinking  1/2 half off drinks); P. F Chang's & Chili's.....with an occasional jaunt to Z-Tejas or the Tavern on Mill (time permitting; natch).    One of my co-workers is from D.C. and has been wet over 5 guys opening for weeks.  Today we finally got to imbibe & partake of all that is 5 Guys.  The food was excellent. The service was fast & efficient for the crowds they served (so glad they were cognizant & well-prepared for things today -- a true surprise for Mill Ave restaurateurs who typically seem clueless to the community in which the run a business); and frankly I loved the food.  Basic; simple; no BS and plentiful portions.    I got a cheeseburger with ketchup; mayo; lettuce & tomato & was pleasantly surprised to find it was a delicious double pattty upon my return to work with my heavy sack o'goodness.  The fries are flat out phenomenal & today's beauties came from \ground apples\"" straight outta Shelly; Idaho.  I appreciate the localization of the carb offerings.  They're skin-on; hand-cut beautes fried in peanut oil (as all things there are cooked; apparently); and the fountain cherry Coke capped off my mid-day repas with classic American stylee & finesse.  I went large with lunch (XL coke & XL fries) and my tab was in the $13 dollar range....which is not odd for Mill Ave & I didnt hafta tip; so awesome.  A co-worker went tiny-sized and got a single burger; small fries & a soda for under $10.  I'd definitely return again; but most likely when I'm having a stressful day; require a greazy lunch and should probably take a good walk after lunch.  I will return for fries and want to try the cheese fries and the hot dog selection.  Everyone was super friendly and I applaud the franchisees for doing a bang-up job on staff training; preparedness and efficiency.""",1
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,After reading many reviews for places to eat in Tempe; I decided I wanted a burger. Chose Five Guys because of a friend of a friend  raving over it.   Walked in and read the 30 signs they had all around the place then finally made my way to order. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion; lettuce; and mustard. My partner ordered a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce; tomato; grilled onion; ketchup;and mustard. We each had a drink and shared a small Cajun fry. We asked the cashier how big each patty was and he said 3.3 to 3.5oz's.  Food was quick. Fries were small but plentiful; actually; we only ate the the extras at the bottom of the bag. The cup was still full. Anyways I started on my burger and found it to be okay. It was good but that's it. The burger was juicy but not flavorful; I am glad that I added the cheese which made it a little better. I really didn't like the seasoned fries; they were better when I dipped them in hot sauce. My partners burger was of course messy but the bacon was good; crunchy and had a smokey flavor. It was good; definitely better than mine but nothing I would crave. Overall; I wasn't blown especially being on Mill; closing at 7 and being overpriced.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys... What cannot be said about this place?  I stumbled upon it last October in Saratoga Springs; NY; where we decided to eat at Chipotle for lack of anything else recognizable.  I saw the Five Guys next door; and decided to try it out instead of having another bland Chipotle burrito.  Needless to say; when I ran into another Five Guys in Ithaca two days later; I knew I had to eat there for lunch.  Since they opened here in the Valley a month or so ago; I've had to restrain myself.  If it weren't for the guaranteed heart attack that would occur were I to dine at Five Guys twice a day; I think I would probably do so.    I should point out that; before I ate at Five Guys; In-N-Out was my favorite fast food burger joint.  But the food at Five Guys is simply superior.  The burgers are tastier and have more options; and the fries are an order of magnitude better.    The only issue I have with this place is that the price is admittedly steep; but when you consider how much food you get; it's not too unreasonable.  If you stick to the Little Hamburger; which is still probably more filling than a normal fast food burger; you could probably get a meal for inside $8; but that meal will still be more substantial than a normal $6 fast food burger meal.  On the upside; however; the price might have the fortunate side effect of discouraging rowdy kids who could care less about the quality of their burger.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I love burgers. I've said it once; and ill say it again; my last meal on earth would absolutely be a burger. It will be juicy and meaty; the bun will be dry and toasty and there will be more pickles than you can count.. It will be accompanied by a mound of delicious french fries and a giant milkshake... Today at lunch; I was invited to try a new burger joint; which apparently everyone loves; and was told that my love affair with In&Out would be shattered.. Well; that was a lie.   I got a cheese burger; fries and a cherry coke. The sheer fact that there is fountain cherry coke automatically merits a star. I liked the options I got for toppings; I chose mayo; pickles; sauteed mushrooms; lettuce and A-1..  I've got to admit; I was excited; really excited.. however; that excitement was quickly shattered when I got my meal.. I unwrapped the tin foil; hoping to find a delicious juicy cheeseburger; just for me.. yeah well; I found a burger; just for me; but it was WET. The entire bun was drenched.. THIS; ladies and gents; this disgusts me to no end. One of the words I hate most in the world is moist; and I also hate when things that are not supposed to be moist; are moist. Especially bread. BARF. The meat wasn't very flavorful either.. and they used portobello mushrooms; that were cold. I frowned. My lunch date frowned back. The fries were apparently from Shelly Idaho; I know this because they have a \Todays fries are from..\"" board.. they taste just like In&Outs; just thicker.. so basically it is imperative that you order them well done.  The place is big; holds a lot of people and they are really well staffed; but the meal was just meh.. and for the two of us the total came out to be $22.00. TWENTY TWO DOLLARS for 2 cheeseburgers; fries and a drink.. for real??   Whatever; i know its inevitable that I will give this place another shot; mostly because I work next door; and Fat Burger doesn't do it for me.. But I was just really really sad with the whole experience. I don't eat burgers often; so when I do its a treat; and well; this was not a treat.   *sigh*""",0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"This place is seriously over-rated.  The Zagat reviewers that called this one of the best burgers should be put into a rocket and shot into the sun.  It would be alright if you were looking for a cheap fast food burger; but the price implies it's much more.  The bacon cheeseburger is $6; fries are $5; drinks over $2.  The burger is over-cooked and a bit on the dry side.  They use some kind of runny goo they call \cheese\"" but is pretty nasty both in flavor and consistency.  I do have to say the ingredients like tomato; lettuce; and onions were fresh.  The bread is fresh but ultra-generic grocery store quality.  Low on flavor and just boring.  The fries are excellent; but for $5 they better be.  They are the thick soft style; so if you don't like that style; you won't like these.  I do like them and they were good; just not quite $5 good.  The burger disappointment really took the enjoyment out of the fries.  You'd be doing just as well by ordering the higher-end burgers at a chain fast food restaurant.  Or go to Culver's or In-N-Out for a higher-quality burger.""",0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"Well....I had been hearing about this joint for weeks.  So after spending New Years Eve on Mill Ave; the hubby and I were looking for more than the undesirable street fair food.  We walked on over to Five Guys.  The line was long; the place was packed! \MUST BE GOOD\""; we said to one anther.  $4 something for the Small Cheeseburger.  We each ordered a burger and shared an order of \""their award winning fries\"" (sarcasm).  Thirteen dollars later and fifteen minutes; we received our food.  We rushed two blocks over to our hotel.  Now to make a long story short; save your calories; time; and money.  I have had a better burger from the Golden Arches; for a lot less money. Twelve dollars less.  Happy 2011!""",0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Walking in to Five Guys; I was rather excited; and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before; so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud; at least. The music was classic rock; which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes; someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day; not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order; one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out; but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.  Much to my dismay; they did not offer Dr. Pepper; my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks; but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes; my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside; not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries; which were in a cup; and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special; and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor; but there was simply too much salt. As a result; in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large; I finished only about half of my fries.  Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal; so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping; I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing; at all. Almost disgusting; as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun; and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite; it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste; I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's.   Upon finishing my meal; I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy; and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times; which I did; as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it; it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall; Five Guys is way to expensive; unbelievably greasy; and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though; thus the two stars.   If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out; INO is the clear winner in every category.,0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Great burger and fries--hot and flavorful; good toppings. Not exactly Michelin star quality but a great burger joint; which it aims to be. Friendly and efficient service.,1
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"Food is yummy!!!! I have never been to a 5 Guys; so I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a burger; unaware that it is actually a double burger; which was HUGE! Hubby and I shared a large fry. We could have easily split a burger and a small fry. Love that fact that \everything\"" includes grilled mushrooms and onions. So much food. This location was messy. I am not sure of the peanuts are a great idea because there are shells and dust everywhere.""",0
0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,A friend of mine had hyped this place up for the past week and so I was definitely excited to take it for a test drive. When we arrived; it was during lunch hours and the place was pretty busy; but we walked right up to the front and placed our order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger; and let me tell you; this thing was no joke! I asked for extra crispy bacon; mayo; and ketchup and everything was prepared as I had requested. Lots of flavor; two thick and  juicy patties; and enough grease to power an alternative fuel vehicle...quite tasty. Between three of us; we split a small order of Cajun fries and they were pretty decent. The thicker the cut of the fry; the soggier they were; but not bad. Our food was prepared quickly; and the service was good for being as busy as they were. As mentioned; this isn't the most cost effective meal if you're on a budget; but for the quality of the food I'm ok with that. Will definitely be back when I need a burger fix for lunch. Nice work; Five Guys.,0

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,This place isn't bad; though I'm not sure it's a place I'd visit all the time.   The burgers are cheap; but they're a bit bland in flavor and certainly are messy. They also like to make these burgers tall.    The fries are great. And the service was friendly. I only wish the burgers had more flavor.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I love lobby's. The staff is super nice and attentive; and the burgers are juicy and delicious. It's a little bit pricier for a meal; but I definitely think it's way more worth it than getting a burger from mcdonald's or burger king. Everything is made fresh when you order it; so prepare to enjoy some deliciousness! It's also super clean in there; so I don't feel gross about eating there.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Before eating at Lobby's I had never eaten Chicago style food; and man it is delicious!   I ordered an Italian Beef sammie with hot peppers and cheddar and it was basically a giant meat sandwich dipped in sauce and it was so good it's making my mouth water just thinking about it. If you go there; make sure you order that. Also; the fries are super crispy and great with the fry sauce.  You will love it.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,This review is long overdue and could have been written well over a year ago!  You won't find truffle oil; baby arugula or bleu cheese crumbles here. What you will find is a great; honest burger with any of the basics one might desire. I've been here a few times and the burgers as well as the Italian beef are excellent.  The owner is cool and there more times than not.  They use really good beef and it shows in the final product.  The other ingredients are fresh and tasty as well. The place itself is nice; clean and the staff have always been friendly. They cook to order right in front of you; on a flat top; so no surprises! Fries are crinkle cut and good.  I'm usually not a fan of the crinkle cut; but Lobby's are tasty! Will I go again; absolutely!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I had lunch here the other day.  It was a bit before the noon lunch rush so it wasn't too crowded.  You could tell they were gearing up for it so I can tell they get pretty busy.  So come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door.    I like that their menu isn't huge with zillions of burger combos and other options.  It was pretty straight forward.  I had the standard burger; fries and a drink.  Everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok.  The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner.  The burger was thick; juicy and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious.  The fries were also pretty good.  They are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.  I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so I used it for my fries and my burger.  I think it was some chipotle mayo stuff.  It was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers and/or fries.  This place isn't exactly cheap but it is worth it.  I can't think of a better fast food burger/fries in the area.  I would return to get the burger but I really want to try their Italian beef as well.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I guess my mistake is that I ate at Lobby's in the evening when the owner wasn't there.  The young lady working the counter was sweet and was trying her best; but missed getting the order correct. Two burgers were ordered with cheese and bacon. Unfortnately the secret sause was added on to the burgers. We just wiped the sauce off but what an inconvenience. My burger was missing the bacon and a little under cooked. Meh; I've tasted better. The chicken sandwich sucked according to my wife. So that put a downer on the whole meal and a real silent car drive over to Chick Fil A to get a replacement for the uneaten chicken sandwich.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I am so disappointed. We really like the burgers here; and in the past ate here at least once a month. Unfortunately; after the service that we rec'd tonight; we will not be back. This time we decided to order take-out; and when we got home we realized that the order was messed up. We ordered fries and 3 burgers one of which was supposed to be just a beef patty wrapped in lettuce w/ extra lettuce (my son can not have wheat or dairy). Unfortunately; they put it on a bun and added cheese to it. Taking the bun off is not a big deal but it would have been impossible to get the cheese off. It is inconvenient to drive back there again; but my son had his heart set on a burger. I called Lobby's and spoke to the owner who happened to be the person who took my order when I called earlier. All I wanted to do was exchange burgers. The owner was extremely argumentative on the phone; spoke to me in a rude manner; and told me that I didn't make sense; but he did agree to make a new one. When my husband arrived to swap the burgers; the employees told him that he needed to bring our entire order back in order to swap out the one messed up burger. Then the owner came out and started arguing with my husband and told him that he should have just scraped the cheese off. They did finally start making a new burger which he had to sit there and wait for while my son hungrily waited at home; even though I called in advance. Then as my husband tried to leave the owner followed him to the door and told him that people try to pull some kind of messed-up-order-scheme on them all the time and they end up having to throw away so much food because of it. Seriously; we gained nothing from this experience but a lot of wasted time and a hungry; cranky child. We did not ask for complimentary food or our money back. All we wanted was food that our son would be able to eat without getting sick. I am completely shocked by the owner's aggressive behavior and will not be back again.  Truth be told; one of our other burgers was messed up too. It was supposed to be wrapped in lettuce; but they put it on a bun. Not a big deal; we just took the bun off of it. Perhaps; I wasn't clear enough when I ordered; although this is how I always order it there and have never had an issue before. The mistakes were inconvenient; but it wouldn't have deterred us from coming back in the least had it not been for the rude; aggressive owner.,0

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Yesterday was my third time back and I have to bump them up to five stars now. I had the Italian beef this time and it was probably the best I have ever had; certainly better to my taste than Al's in Chicago. The service just keeps getting better and better also. Prices can get a little high when you start to add things--for instance peppers or cheese--but still worth it.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great service; great burgers; fresh veggies. Go in hungry; because you will be overwhelmingly dissapointed if you cant finish off as much beef as possible.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Had another delicious meal with a dash of friendly service; and and a side of a great atmosphere! Corny; i know but whatever. Upped my star rating! :) Really need to get my co-workers over here.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,friendly staff;quick service and excellent food. I had the bacon burger and it was great. I will be back to try more food items.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby; Lobby; Lobby you spoiled me.  Your burgers are so good.  I walked in and was instantly warmly greeted at the counter.  The young man took my order with a smile and sense of humor.  I love that!  I ordered a bacon chesse burger with provolone.  When I unwrapped it I knew I had found near perfection.  The burger was on a fresh sesame bun; the bacon was nice and crisp but not over done and the cheese.....oh the cheese.....it was melted over the burger.  9 times out of 10 when you get a cheese burger it looks like they just slapped the cheese on right before they put the rest of the toppings on so it's not melted.  In my mind the cheese should be melted down the sides of the burger; not an afterthought to be slapped on at the last minute.  I took a bite and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly; just a tiny bit pink inside.  Ahhhh!!  I also got crinkle cut fries and they were perfectly cooked as well and not greasy at all.  Lobby's has a secret sauce....you must get a side of the secret sauce to dip your fries in....YUM!!!  The soda cups are a generous size and free refills are included.    The whole place was clean and well lit.  You can see them cooking too.  Lobby; yes that is his real name; was there running the show and making sure his customers were happy.  I hear the Italian Beef sandwich is to die for so I will try that next.  I'm gonna have to psych myself into it though cause that burger was so darn good!    Thank you Lobby!!!  I'll be back soon!!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Upon my second visit to Lobby's I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich.  WOW!  Go hungry if you're gonna get this one cause it is HUGE!  And it's really more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Oh sure; you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time.  The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.    Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile; willingness to help if I have questions; and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair; I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless; again; a big plus for me.    When I crave a burger; this is what I crave.  A real beef patty with fresh ingrediants; cheese; and sometimes bacon.  This is by far my favorite burger joint.  Support your locan businesses!!  Especially the ones that go that extra mile and really care!!!,1

The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.    Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile; willingness to help if I have questions; and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair; I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless; again; a big plus for me.    When I crave a burger; this is what I crave.  A real beef patty with fresh ingrediants; cheese; and sometimes bacon.  This is by far my favorite burger joint.  Support your locan businesses!!  Especially the ones that go that extra mile and really care!!!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Good Italian Beef and Sausage sandwiches.  I stopped at Lobby's after reading Allison L's review in Yelp.  They were both good; the review and the eatery.      I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and ate Italian Beef and combo sandwiches several times per week.  Great after school food; or when we could sneak out of school for lunch.  Nothing is better on the way home after a night out on the town.    Walking into Lobby's the place is sparkling clean and new.  There are nine or ten tables in the dining area.  As you approach the counter and order your food you can watch it being prepared.  The servers take great pleasure in creating sandwiches exactly the way you want them.  The nice feature about this place is your food is prepared when you order it; never ahead of time.  It doesn't seem to take any longer than the places that prepare the food ahead of time.  It just tastes better.    Italian beef is a slow cooked roast beef that is thinly sliced then simmered in a tasty au jus.  The beef at Lobbys is tender and tasty.  I like the combo sandwich with both beef and sausage; then add sweet peppers  and some gardiner peppers on the side.  The sausages are delightful and tasty.  The  Italian beef is served on a french roll that is baked fresh.  Lobby's has good bread.  They add just enough au jus to the bread to make it tasty without ruining the bun.   Lobby's cooks crinkle cut french fries.  Authentic Chicago style tasty fries.  I love them with thick Heinz ketchup.    I haven't tried the hot dogs yet.  That is where I have to differ from Lobby's on the authenticity of 'Chicago Style' dogs.  To my mind an Chicago style dog is steamed not grilled; topped off with fresh condiments and served on a steamed bun with poppy seeds.  I know you can't taste poppy seeds but they give the sandwich the occasional surprise crunch!  Lobby's grills the hot dogs; tops them off with fresh condiments and serves them on a steamed bun.  They get points for doing a good job.  I haven't seen any poppy seed buns west of the Mississippi yet.  Maybe it is just a Chicago thing.    The staff is friendly and helpful and will take time to explain the menu if you need it.  The drinks are one size fits all; giant 32 oz monsters.  The nice thing about writing these Yelp reviews is I get to thinking about the delicious beef sandwiches and now I have to head back to Lobby's for another one!    See ya there!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"I think it's funny that places like this are creating such a splash in the local food scene. Lobby's excels at being an average burger joint by using high quality; fresh ingredients. It's the kind of place that once was common; but was replaced in the last 20 years by novel and trendy restaurant concepts of other sorts. Or; for a more modern reference; imagine if Fudrucker's got rid of its ambiance and added a Chicago twist with its Italian beef; Polish sausage; and Chicago dogs.  Lobby's is very proud of its caramelized onions (apparently; they have a magical way of making a crispy white onion brown and soft). When I asked about getting sauerkraut on a Polish sausage; the owner insisted that he too loves sauerkraut; but the onions are sooooooo much better: \Just look! We grill them right here;\"" he says; pointing at the grill. In other words; they do not offer sauerkraut.   And then there's the secret sauce. It's pink! And when offered as a dipping sauce for the otherwise mediocre school-cafeteria-style fries; it's made a little bit spicy with chili powder or something of the sort. Again; total magic!  Just so that I don't sound too let down; I will say that the buns make the burgers above average at Lobby's. Good idea not to skimp on the buns. As you walk in; you get the sense that this place should have a drive thru and charge $2-3 per burger; but the burgers are more comparable to pub fare. And apparently people love Lobby's. My three stars are below average; and the owner drives a Mercedes when he's not happily engaging in chit chat with his customers -- they're apparently doing well enough and I would frequent this place if it were in my neighborhood.  So if you're ever craving a burger and fries in Tempe; I would say skip the In-N-Out and go here instead. But for hot dogs? Granted; I'll never understand the whole Chicago dog craze; but this place is right near Ted's.... The only way I'm ordering a dog other than Ted's in the area is if it's wrapped in bacon and prepared Sonoran style. Sorry; Lobby's. Also; your onions are pretty much the same as anyone else's caramelized onions. I still want sauerkraut on my Polish sausage.""",0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,*3.8*  I was craving a hot dog today and was near Ted's but remember I had bookmarked Lobby's and decided to try it. New; nice and simple interior. Not busy even though it was lunch time; I guess because it's a new place. Service was very good. I ordered a hot dog; fries and soda. I got my soda and my food was brought to me. The fries were very good; I would have liked them to be hotter though. My first impression when I saw my hot dog was what the..?!!! The relish was radioactive green! It looked fake. I am not familiar with Chicago style hot dogs; so I wonder if the relish is supposed to look that way? In any case; the relish was a tad too sweet for my taste. The hot dog was tasty and the bun was delicious!! Fluffy and fresh; could have eaten it even without the hot dog.  Being a new local place I wish them luck and will continue to visit to try other items. The burgers and beef sandwiches looked great.,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Boyfriend and I went to try Lobby's after seeing the phenomenal reviews.  He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries. He got his in a combo that came with a side of fries and a drink. The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice.  He was really excited for new people to try his food.    We went and grabbed a table and just as we sat down; a rush of people came in.  There must be a lot of regulars because he was greeting some by name. There must be something to this food for that many loyal customers.   Not too long after we got our drinks; the food was ready. I decided to immediately dive into the chili cheese fries. The cheese was like the melty nacho kind (not spicy though) and the chili was actually kind of sweet. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chili. My boyfriend did like it and he doesn't usually like chili. I'd probably just get cheese or plain fries next time.  The little veggie sandwich was so tasty! It was lettuce; tomato and pickles (I didn't want onions) with their house sauce on a sesame seed bun.  I'd love to try a burger next time.  The boyfriend did like his sandwich except he didn't know it was going to be \dipped\"".  He doesn't like his sandwiches dipped; so if he were to get that again; he would request it dry.  The sandwich was hearty (I added a pic) and very filling. He kept stealing my chili cheese fries so I take it he liked those too.   It was really bright and clean in there and the owner and the guy making the food were really cool.  I'd definitely come back. We both want to try the burgers next time. Although....the hot dog with all the stuff does look damn tasty too....""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Never coming here again. Manager/owner took my order and apparently put in the wrong item. My order is called and it's the wrong item.  No big deal. Just make the correct burger. It didn't end there though. I was expected to pay the $1 and some change difference between a bacon burger and a double burger. Are you serious!? This wasn't my mistake it was yours. The manager/owner said this is a business I have to charge you. Not cool and I will be sure to tell all my friends and family to never come here again. Absolutely terrible business practices to make a customer pay more for your mistake. Especially for a $1 and some change. And one more thing I noticed as I was writing this. It got worse. Not only was I expected to pay more but I ordered a double burger and then was charged the difference for a double bacon burger. I was overcharged! Yet another item I didn't order. Holy cow this place is terrible!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Last Friday at Yelp Office Hours here I had a nice lunch here; having one of their regular burgers & fries; & gave Lobby's 3-Stars.  I learned afterward though that I hadn't really ordered the \real deal\""; so I got together with Lynn W. yesterday to return & try Donald S's special sandwich this time.  Here's the order:  \""An Italian Beef; hot; with provolone & hot giardiniera; full dip;\"" plus a fries.  Pretty soon here came my sandwich.  This baby has been completely dipped in au jous; so it' more of a knife & fork sandwich than one you eat with your hands; unless you don't mind getting them all wet.  Either way; it's really good!  Italian Beef sandwich ordered as above; a little pricey at $7.38; fries $1.89.""",0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Enjoyed Lobby's on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Great service; tastey burger.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,A great place to go for great food.    Location- It's a small space in a strip mall but that's not the draw of this great restaurant.    Food- Awesome; large burgers; Chicago style dogs (from an owner who is a Chicago native); Italian beef and a variety of sausages.  I had the double bacon burger tonight and it was a big portion of amazing; fresh veggies and good quality beef.  You know when you have a cheap burger where even the pickles are gross; well here the pickles are thick cut and great; the bacon is really tasty and everything else is perfect.    Note on food- They also have a burger challenge where you have to eat a 9 patty burger in 10 minutes to get your picture on the wall and a t-shirt.  I haven't tried this yet but want to soon.  Owner- The owner was working when we were there and he takes real pride in his food and his product.  He talked about how he fresh makes all of his fries to order because he never wants people to have soggy fries. He also gave us a big basket of fresh fries for free because he didn't want to throw them away and would not serve them to a later customer.   More reviews to come as I try more of their great food!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Being a native Chicagoan my interest was piqued. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean. Ordered a Chicago style hot dog the hot dog was grilled;Chicago style is steamed as is the bun but the bun was wet and therefore was a soggy pastry mess; the fries were mediocre at best ; the dipping sauce was very good.  Needs some changes in the food preparation and pray that Portillos does not open in the area.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"The website boasts 100% Grass-fed Iowa beef; the prices were reasonable and the delivery guy was very nice and personable. The rest of my experience was absolutely awful. First off; the delivery service is run through another company. Who outsources delivery drivers? Evidently these folks do; and you pay for it with patience and money. We ordered three of the same burgers (bacon burgers with added cheddar); and modified one to have no onion and no sauce. We also ordered one order of cheese fries with added peppers; and two plain orders of fries on the side. The website was fickle and we had to put in the correct combinations of \Letter-perfect\"" street addresses; which was aggravating but manageable. Our order showed up precisely on time; the delivery guy looked stressed and hands over a half-soaked white bag covered in what he claims is cheese sauce and says \""The fries busted.\"" So I scurry off to the kitchen with our food to inspect the damages and the cheese fries are fine; the cheese sauce couldn't have run all over the inside of the bag because it was ice cold. Anyone who has handled cold cheese sauce knows it's like salty silly putty when it's cold. No; it is in fact the sauce from the burger that nobody ordered on the side. We just plain didn't want the burger sauce; but we got in anyway; all over our entire order. The delivery guy calls the restaurant and tells them what happened; they say they will replace the entire order but that it will take another hour to get back to us. We called the restaurant and the girl who picked up the phone was rude; abrupt and blamed the delivery guy for throwing the food around. He blamed her for packaging it badly. She showed no care or concern for our complaint and couldn't get us off the phone fast enough. We asked to speak to a manager and she says \""I can take a message\"". Oh; so now the underpaid help is fielding complaints for the manager or is it that she has no intention of doing anything about it but wiping her a** with the complaint slip? I think it's the latter. She really was the most awful representative for a dining establishment I have ever encountered. I have bar-tended and served in high end and low end restaurants for ten years and I have to say; she has NO business being in the food business. She should be relieved of her *obviously* so-stressful position at the front counter of Lobby's burgers and fries. Then; when we hang up with that one; the manager calls us and sensing that he is unable to make things right as they have gone so so terribly wrong; he hangs up on us! Awesome customer service abounds here! So yes; what little corner I could taste of the burger was absolutely delicious; though 99.9% of it went right in the trash. I wish I had gotten an edible order so we could have enjoyed all of it. It's sad; really; a whole meal wasted because someone put sauce in a bag that we didn't even want. I would consider trying it again; but the girl on the phone; the manager and the delivery service make me really think twice before going back.""",0

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Against the the recommendation of my friend; Steven G.; who has already wrote a review; I headed down to this place to try it out.   My significant other was extremely excited to try this place out; specifically; the Italian beef. I must say; I was pretty excited too. The service was really good; they all seemed very nice; even the cook was asking us how the food tasted. That's nice of them. B1G1 coupon w/purchase of 2 drinks and cheese comes out to $15 still...umm; pointless to use a coupon; I don't drink soda anyways.  The burger was delicious; well the beef patties were. I got a double; and this place totally reminded me of Johnny Rockets; but the patties were definitely nice and big. I think its like $6+tax for a double which is a good value; but the fries are ~$2; and its just frozen crinkle cut fries it seems like. This must be a joke; crinkle cut fries are what you get at the school/university cafeterias. I was hoping for something a little bit more unique here. The fries were well done; but I don't its worth getting them. They have this special \fry sauce\"" or \""Lobby\"" sauce. Its a unique recipe; and my significan other was raving about it while we were eating. Yeah; it was pretty good; but it doesn't make up for average fries. It does add some flavor to the burgers; and the cold crisp vegetables definitely deserve a ton of praise. However; the bottom bun was super soggy. Just plain old; super soggy. The burger patties were just ridiculously greesy; its good to a certain point; but when the grease is owning your buns; you need to cut back.  The Italian beef? I heard some guy that was ordering saying it was the best in the valley. I laughed. By the time my significant other got to the sandwich the bread had seemed like it had been drenched in water. It sort of reminded me of a hot dog eating competition; just dunk your bread in the water. Fail. Unfortunately; this was just a disappointment. I was astonished how this could happy. Seriously; I just wasn't sure how you could mess up that bad. Its a shame; because I know the cook cared how the food tasted. I really wanted a tasty Italian beef; but I guess it wasn't in my destiny.  Lobby seems like a cool guy; and maybe this was an off day or something. But I have to be fair; I want to give this place a higher rating; though I can't say it is warranted at the moment.""",1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,After attending this year's burger battle and speaking with Lindsey F. about how great Lobby's burgers are; this place has been on my radar for a while now. I don't get to Tempe very often; but when I did; I was going to be sure to give Lobby's a try. I finally got there yesterday and Lindsey was true to her word; because they made a really tasty burger. Would I rank it #1 on my Best Burgers in Phoenix list? No; but it will certainly make the list!  I ordered a bacon cheese burger with cheddar. One thing that disappointed me was that they don't offer American cheese; but cheddar will do. The burger came out hot; cheesy; and smothered in their homemade sauce. It was very similar to In N' Out's style; but with a bigger burger (1/3lb). The burger was a perfect combination of salty and sweet.  They also offer a burger challenge for some crazy gluttonous patrons to try out. You have only 10 minutes to eat a nonuple cheeseburger and get your photo on their Wall of Fame. Otherwise; it'll set you back $30. I personally think 10 minutes is ridiculous. 15 minutes would be fair. All is all; forget the challenge and get yourself a normal cheeseburger. You'll be very satisfied!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Haven't written a review in a while.  Now's the time.  I saw Lobby's from the road for a while as we were going from here to there.  I saw the sign and thought; \Hmmm; burgers;\""  The GeoQpons coupon from my iPhone was my incentive to take my family over for lunch.  Cool ambiance here.    The first thing that I caught my eye about Lobby's is the service.  Everybody was friendly and attentive; and we even got a big mound of extra crinkle fries with our burgers--I'm not kidding; the guy just scooped a whole bunch of extra fries on our tray.  There ain't nuthin' fancy about these burgers; and that's what makes 'em special.  Simple; fresh; grilled meat; topped any way you like (and believe me; these things can get topped REALLY high).  Fries were simple and tasty.  We left full and happy.  Next time; I might try me a dog or an Italian sandwich--we'll see.  This place rocks.""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,A burger joint is a burger joint is a burger joint right? Wrong. Not when it is done right. This joint does it right. The burgers are made with quality ingredients which makes them tasty and juicy. I had a chili cheese burger that was flavorful without being too salty or oily (have them put their hot giardiniera on it; makes a big difference). I ordered it as a combo with fries and a soda for around $8. Not a bad deal. So if you are looking for a burger joint above the mondane; pay the extra couple of bucks it will be worth it.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I love when a tiny eatery outshines a bigger chain; but Lobby's basically is a stripped-down Portillo's that doesn't compare to the Chicago Italian beef giant.   Kudos for fast; friendly service and grass-fed beef.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,My friend Sang raved about this place; so we went there tonight. This was my first time here so  I ordered the combo burger with cheese and everything on it after Sam recommened it. She was dead on; the burger was mouth watering and the fries were perfect with the fries sauce. I was left feeling full and happy.   I think Sam made my burger expereince the best as I was a newbie to the place and she helped me pick out the right burger; the owner should give this girl a raise; shes awsome!!!  I will be coming back for more burgers : ),1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,In a small unassuming shop in Tempe hidden on an odd facing side of a strip mall there is a little piece of burger heaven on earth. You wouldn't be able to tell from the outside what divine things are going on inside but I will tell you inside is cheeseburger bliss. I had never been here before until a few weeks ago. Many of my friends talked very highly of the this place and I had wanted to try it for some time. So I decided the time was right to finally see what all of the hype was about but then the time wasn't right so I changed the time. Now it was right and I invited some friends along to share in the experience. We arrived one by one on a  Saturday night. I was the first to arrive. Others filtered in after me. It is a small place with only a few tables but it is very clean and nice inside. Very modern. The staff were all very friendly and genuinely nice. The menu; which is printed up very large and posted up front next to where you place your order; is not very extensive. Which is good. Better to be very good at a few things then be mediocre at a lot of things and try and please everyone. I went full bore with my very first order. Double bacon cheeseburger; frys and a chocolate milkshake. The price was not that bad either for all of that food. Order placed I took my seat and saved some tables for the others that soon arrived. We ended up with a pretty good crowd. About 14 people all told. All of which thoroughly enjoyed themselves. When my order was called out a few minties later; I rushed up to the counter eagerly anticipating my delicious meal. It looked and smelled great. I went and sat back down. I started munching on the frys first. Hot frys are the best and I was waiting until more people showed up. The frys were very good. I was reminded by Meagan B that I made a rookie mistake and forgot to ask for the famous Lobby's sauce. I quickly remedied that situation. Now finally came the time for my first bit of this heavenly cheeseburger that sat before me. Dripping with cheese and plied high with bacon; lettuce; tomatos; red onion and of course the famous Lobby sauce. From the first bite I was whisked away to a place of divine cheeseburger happiness. So juicy and gooey. The lettuce; tomatos and onion where crisp and fresh. The eitire thing was so good. I almost ate it fast but slowed down a little to really enjoy it. I almost wanted another but my stomach said no. I did get another order of frys and a drink. I will definitely be back. How can a cheeseburger lover like me turn down burger heaven on earth. And truly it is. I would like to thank my friends for telling me about this place especially Meagan B and Laz C. Also I would like to thank everyone who came out that night to share this experience with me. You made it even better with your company. It is always the small unassuming places that serve the best food. This really is one of the best burger places in town. Trust me when I say this because I have sampled many a cheeseburger from across this great state and land. Go forth and indulge in cheeseburger heaven on earth. You will taste that is it good and know that it is good.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobbys makes my favorite burger in the valley.  They use fresh beef; which makes a tremendous difference in the flavor of the meat; and are cooking on a flattop griddle; which in my opinion is the best way to make a burger.   The grill man throws down a ball of the fresh beef on the griddle then smashes it with a spatula; resulting in a delicious and juicy patty with nice caramelization on the outside of the meat.  The buns are buttered and placed on the griddle then steamed with the burger; giving them a softness and unbelievable flavor to complement the meat; and the burger is finished with onion; lettuce; tomato; and a special sauce which is tangy like a thousand island.  I'm a hamburger guy; but my wife always gets the bacon cheeseburger which comes with a choice of American or provolone and it's out of this world.    The frys are crinkle cut and not fresh but are cooked to order; which is nice.  This place is a Chicago style burger joint so they also have Chicago style dogs and Italian Beef.  I feel out of my element reviewing Italian Beef as I've got no Chicago connections; though I do love the city and all the food traditions that come from there.  That being said; it's the best I've had in the valley as well; and I would still be a regular here if the Italian Beef was the only thing on the menu.  I've never ordered a hot dog from here; as Chicago dogs aren't my thing and I can't imagine coming here and not ordering a burger or Italian Beef.  The atmosphere is casual; with a self-service soda dispenser and TV's around in the dining area with ESPN on all day; which is great if you're popping in for lunch on your own.  Lobbys is a real gem near my neighborhood in Tempe; and I hope I'm able to eat here for many years to come.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobbys makes my favorite burger in the valley.  They use fresh beef; which makes a tremendous difference in the flavor of the meat; and are cooking on a flattop griddle; which in my opinion is the best way to make a burger.   The grill man throws down a ball of the fresh beef on the griddle then smashes it with a spatula; resulting in a delicious and juicy patty with nice caramelization on the outside of the meat.  The buns are buttered and placed on the griddle then steamed with the burger; giving them a softness and unbelievable flavor to complement the meat; and the burger is finished with onion; lettuce; tomato; and a special sauce which is tangy like a thousand island.  I'm a hamburger guy; but my wife always gets the bacon cheeseburger which comes with a choice of American or provolone and it's out of this world.    The frys are crinkle cut and not fresh but are cooked to order; which is nice.  This place is a Chicago style burger joint so they also have Chicago style dogs and Italian Beef.  I feel out of my element reviewing Italian Beef as I've got no Chicago connections; though I do love the city and all the food traditions that come from there.  That being said; it's the best I've had in the valley as well; and I would still be a regular here if the Italian Beef was the only thing on the menu.  I've never ordered a hot dog from here; as Chicago dogs aren't my thing and I can't imagine coming here and not ordering a burger or Italian Beef.

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,If this is a 4 1/2 stars bus on Yelp; I think my rating would be qualified as a hater review...but oh well need to be honest to myself.  New to Phoenix; I was surely unfamiliar with this area. This has nothing to do with Lobbys but it took me quite a while to find and don't think I'll find it immediately still (why bother; doubtfully I'll go).  Ordered Chicago dog with an order of fry; straight forward right?  Then realized I made a huge mistake. Coming from mid-west and had $1 REAL Chicago dog in Chicago; I was disappointed by the $3-some Tempe dog; just nothing exciting. Fries were hot; but nothing surprise. And yeah this meal cost me $7; O_o not for meal as such!  Nothing outrages; nothing wrong; just nothing special. Kicking myself driving 4 miles; spending 7 USD during the 110 weather just to eat something regular and cheap I would've totally be able to find back home.  Do I hate Lobbys? Nope. Would I come back again? Nah; not unless some kinda date who is super charming and force me to coming over; or I am near the area and starve to death. And NO Chicago dog for SHURE.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Really good burgers and chili cheese fries.  It was not to expensive.  Great customer service although it took a long time to get my order....almost 20 min.  I haven't been back because of the slow service but I would eat there again for sure.,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,What is going on with the service in this place??!  You can have good food but if your service is lacking no one will eat there!!!!    I drove to Lobby's about three to four weeks ago now; on a Sunday; I looked up their hours which are listed on their website AND on their door as Sunday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. My family and I arrived at 6 pm.  All the lights were off but there was a girl at the register.  We walked in and she said WE ARE CLOSED.  We tried to see if there was a reason the door and website said that they should be open but she wasn't having any part of our conversation.  We chalked it up to a bad night and returned again a week later on a Friday evening; which their hours are listed as Monday to Friday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  We arrived at 7:15 to the same scene of lights off but a person at the register.  It was the same girl as last time so we didn't even bother walking in this time because she was so rude last time.   I emailed them through their website asking what was going on and I have yet to receive a reply.  Who runs a business like this???  It is really unfortunate because each time we went to Lobby's we would take a friend or two so they can see how delish their food is only to be greeted by rude employees and closed doors!  I don't know if I will be back or recommend this place anymore.  Like I said you can have good food but if your service isn't up to par no one will go there!  I had slow service the last time I was actually able to eat there.  There are way too many good burger joints out there to choose from to put up with this. I am sorry but they have dropped the ball.  I will not be back.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,This is the very first time I have ever been here. I had never even heard of it before.  Nestled in a little shopping center that is half empty is Lobby's. I Ordered a regular Cheese burger with fries; Mario got a double. Less than $20.00 for both of us including the tip.  What amazed me at first as we waited for our food; was how very sparkling clean the place was; Here they are cooking grease all day and the stainless steel was shiny like The Top of the Chrysler Building! Which means they fully scrub it down every night.   When we did get our food it was amazing!!! Yes it was hot; fresh; and oh so good.  You could see the meat had no fillers ;the tomato's were a bit unripe but other than that; it was fantastic. I wanted to save a little for the dog (to take home). But; I ate it all. Fries were also really good.   While we were there they had their meat delivery ; and guess what ! It is fresh meat that will do home delivery from grain feed cattle.  This place is the bomb of the Burger World. It is just as you made it at home.  The staff was super good as well; very friendly and always busy.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,This place was amazing!!! The burgers were bomb. Great service as well,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"ALERT!  ALERT!  5 STAR BURGER JOINT! GREAT PRICES! FRIENDLY SERVICE!  AM I SHOUTING?!    Oh; sorry. I tend to hit \caps lock\"" when I have headphones on.  I had lunch here with my wonderful wife; my youngest daughter and my friend Donald S (not to be confused with Don S...it has happened).  Let me just say I was impressed with my burger and fries.  Cheesy fries.  With bacon. Tender and juicy burger.  Done just right.  Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's; which will be soon.  Maybe dinner today.  We did chat with the owner; Lobby.  Nice guy; great local business.  Go here.""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I am not a hot dog person at all.  I've had 3 hot dogs in the past 5 years but since finding the Chicago dog I've had 3 hot dogs in 2 months.  The French fries are great and the drink sizes are huge.  A little pricey for a hot dog; fries and a drink but the quality is great; service is good and the place is very clean.    I recommend checking them out if you are a hot dog or hamburger fan.  Be prepared to wait longer than at a fast food joint because they do make them Fresh.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I love this place!!! The first time I went I fell in love with their fries and their secret sauce. They have those great crinkle fries and they are made to order so they come out super crispy and hot. They alone can stand on their own but I have to have the sauce. It has to be a mixture of ketchup; mayo probably some chili powder and some other stuff that I can't figure out. No matter how many times I try to do it at home I never get it. Once before I got the Italian Beef but being my first time I didn't know that you could get it wet... Duh... and ended up eating a warm roast beef sandwich that was a bit on the dry side. After reading the Yelp reviews I realized that you can add all kinds of stuff to it. I think that the girl at the register should've at least informed me that I had options. The staff (girls at the register) weren't all too friendly which makes for a less than pleasant experience right from the start. Hopefully they aren't there anymore. Forward to today I decided to give it another shot and I am so glad I did. The owner is a really cool guy and is always super nice when I come in. He asked me all the questions about how I wanted the sandwich and put the dip in a to go cup for me so I wouldn't have a mush sandwich when I got home. I added provolone and hot giardiniera which absolutely made the sandwich. I didn't get to finish it because my other half smelled it and swooped in and polished it off and loved it too. Good thing I got the fries! I would highly recommend this place. If you do have the Italian Beef you should try to eat it there instead of taking it home. If you get embarrassed easily or worry about food all over your hands and face then don't eat this infront of other people. I think it once you eat it you won't even care if it gets in your hair. So I say get over it and get your butt down to Lobbys and eat til you explode!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Was dyingggggg for a burger during work one day and I found this place on Yelp.   This place is literally down the street from my work so I had to try it out; especially with such good ratings. I ordered the Bacon burger with a side of fries. It wasn't the best burger I ever had but it was pretty good. They have their own special sauce on it as well which is also served with their fries. It actually reminded me of In & Out's sauce. That thousand Island shizz... lol. Their fries are good too. Not too salty or soggy but just right. My co worker ordered the chili cheese fries which I got to try. Holy crap; their portion for this was huge! It was a like a 2 person meal maybe. lol.   The pricing wasn't that bad and the staff was really friendly. Plus I got my meal quick! The only thing was I felt like I needed to hit the gym after scarfing everything down. lol. I'll definitely come back when I'm feenin for a burger since it's so close to my work. =),0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Let me say... Delicious!  This burger gem is hidden in the back of the plaza and isn't easy to find.  Once you're inside Lobby's; you get to choose your burger how you want it made.  You can choose from a burger; cheeseburger; double; bacon; grilled onions; mushrooms; all of the goodies!  The patties are thick; which is important to me when I choose a burger.  I want to feel like I'm eating meat not just the bun.  The veggies are fresh and the pickles are cut thick so you can taste them on your burger.  The meat is lean and fresh.  Excellence is in every burger and the burger comes hot off the grill straight onto the bun and delivered right to you!    If you like burgers; that are inexpensive; I would highly recommend trying this place out!  You will not regret it... don't forget the fresh crispy fries you can order with your burger and I would try out their fry sauce.  I usually don't like fry sauce; but there is something delicious about this one!    And last perk; they have a check in offer... free drink when you check in.  You can't go wrong!  Run; don't walk to this burger place!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I've now made three trips to Lobby's.  The first was an enormous disappointment; the last two have been exceptional.  On my first trip; I made the mistake of ordering the Italian beef sandwich.  What I received could best be described as a thinly-sliced beef sandwich on a baguette that some jerk spilled soup on.  My sandwich was soggy to the point of disintegration from the moment I received it.  I tend to be a very neat eater; but felt I needed a bib that day.  In addition to the mess; the whole assemblage was bland and unremarkable.    However...  I'd happily recommend Lobby's to anyone who wants a burger.  Upon hearing great things about their hamburgers; I returned to Lobby on two more occcasions.  On both days; I got a ridiculously large; juicy burger with great quality beef and fresh ingredients for a price around half of their competitors (I'm looking at you; Smashburger and Five Guys).    So; go for the burgers and read the menu carefully: the single patty burger is 1/3 pound.  If you order the double; you're ordering more than a half-pound of beef and you will need a nap.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby's is fantastic. I love the hamburger's and the french fries. Ask for a side of sauce to dip the fries in. I have yet to try anything on the menu except the burgers and the dog. I just can't get myself to order anything else because the burgers are so good.  Make sure to try this spot if you're in the area; its my go to joint when I'm at work and craving a hamburger!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,*Burgers are the best*  Our first visit to Lobby's was amazing(read below);so we decided to go again.  !BUT!  On the second visit; the place was relatively empty; handful of people; yet everyone there seemed to have mix ups and problems with their orders.   And sure of course we were no exception. How hard is it to put bacon in a burger?   It was still a good burger don't get me wrong; but if someone can't get a handful of orders right?.... Come on.....  We would have told her our order was wrong except it was takeout. We didn't realise till we got home.  Hopefully the next time the staff will be a bit more attentive to orders.  It helps the whole wanting to go back again and again :),0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,People are right about this place being very clean and the staff being super nice!! Everyone from the cashier to the cook made sure we were satisfied and wanted us to know how they made their food to order! The burgers were very delicious and their burger sauce was very yummy!! I will be back for sure because I liked the food but most importantly because my fiancé and I received excellent customer service...some people forget how far that goes nowadays! Thank you for being so friendly! You've earned our 5 stars!!,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I had driven by Lobby's many times in the past but I never stopped to get food. A few weeks ago I decided to stop by and I have been hooked ever since! This place has authentic; fresh Chicago style food served with love. So far I've indulged in the bacon cheeseburger; italian beef sandwich and the Chicago style hotdog; as well as their fries. Everything is always hot; made to order; and very unique to the area and PHX in general. Eat here and support a great local business; you won't regret it!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Yum; Yum; Yum I was in Chicago two weeks ago and practically begged for an Italian beef sandwich 'cause we didn't have any here in Mesa. They took me to Portillo's  and it was very good. Getting home; I got on line and found Yelp AND Italian beef AND Lobby's I went within a week and bombarded Lobby with questions (we Chicago-born are picky about our IBS's)  Said I did not want to eat it with a knife and fork and asked for Medium dip (his term HALF) and wanted lots of soft bell peppers and onions. The fries were really good with the sauce that I could enjoy even on my arm but the sandwich AAAAH Half dip was perfect; and I picked that sucker up and I'm sure my purring could be heard for miles !  He doesn't skimp on quantity of beef; or quality with no fatty strands to be found; and even if you ordered this dry with au jus on the side; it would be succulent. Lobby smiled as I got up to leave and commented that I had eaten it all. What did he expect ? (and had he seen me digging for the little pieces of beef stuck to the wrapper) ? We yakked about Chicago and his green walls came up with his explanation that it represented lettuce; the red the tomato etc and it was meant to be a hamburger simile. Anyone going to this IBS heaven and looking at the decor would get my Chicago Evil Eye : ),1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Let's face it; there are a lot of places to get a good gourmet burger; including my back yard; but the yummiest burgers are at Lobby's. Lobby makes the rest look average.   Whenever I am in the Tempe area; I always make it a point to pick up and take home burgers (you can dine in as well). If you are in the mood for a juicy burger (and quick) they are way better than any fast food; but not priced much higher. ...AND they are actually better than most sit-down restaurant's burgers. Great seasoning; lightly toasted bun; \special sauce\""; and made to order; simple or the works.  They have other items on the menu; but I haven't gotten past the burgers yet.   For god's sake ask for the \""specially prepared peppers\"" on your burger; baby (methinks they are stewed and dang they're good). Plus - you know you love it when the owner takes your order... Lobby works the joint himself most days.""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"- Italian Beef Sandwich (Could use some Improvement)  - Maxwell Street Polish Dog (Not Approved) - French Fries (As good as they get) - Burgers ( Have yet to try; but they look like the one thing that this place does right)  Chicago Style Italian Beef sandwiches don't seem to have much competition in this town. My two top restaurants for authentic Italian Beef sandwiches remain as Luke's of Chicago; and the recently opened; Chicago's Taylor Street.  I gave Lobbys a shot on three seperate occasions. I met the owner and we talked for quite some time on the first visit. He is a very nice guy; and seemed to speak of his burgers as being his main focus and signature menu item.  As for the Italian Beef at this locaiton; he states that he slow cooks and seasons it himself. The beef isn't bad; but it seems to be lacking the full flavor of his competitors in town. The bread is a great selection; the juice that the beef is cooked in seems rather watered down and again lacks flavor. I always order a side of this hot juice to pour over the sandwich as you would a french dip with au jus.  The giardanara is another big player in the outcome of the sandwich and unfortunately he uses the standard Vienna Beef giardanara. I think that he could really improve the flavor of the sandwich with a better house made or higher quality pickled giardanara than the one that he is currently using.  So for the Italian beef sandwich sandwich; I'm going to leave this as the; \I'm starving to death and closer to this location than one of the competitors\""; choice that I would only resort to in a pinch.  The Maxwell Street Polish is an even bigger disappointment; as it's simply a processed hot dog like; precooked Polish Link as you would buy in the hot dog section at the grocery store. The other competitors that I speak of in town; use a real Polish; Italian; or Brat link as you would purchase from a butcher counter. I would never order this type of sausage from any establishment unless it were Weinerschnitzel..lol  Now to the French Fries; I think that they are as good as they could possibly be. He also offers a signature sauce for them; it seems to be an aioli of some sort and is very tasty. However the fries are great with a little salt and nothing else as well.  I hate to see the lack of competition with what others offer in this town. I think that he could certainly gain a great deal of respect and pull in some loyal customers who look for and appreciate an authentic Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich or Sausage that would typically be offered by an establishment of this type.  Check the place out and write a fitting review; maybe your opinion will be different than mine.   Cheers and much luv! :)""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great burgers!  The house sauce is awesome; beef is delicious and all of the toppings are very fresh. As for service; it's a order at the register kind of place; and you pick the seating. Both times I've gone it has always been very clean and well kept. Another nice thing is that this place actually delivers as well. If your looking for a fairly inexpensive and good quality burger; check this place out.,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Yummy; huge; messy bacon burger. Very friendly service. Will be coming back soon.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The burgers are admittedly fantastic. They are thick and freshly grilled right in front of you.   I have to say though. When I was told the French fries are freshly made; I was disappointed to get a bag of precut crimpcut fries.   And the price to upgrade from a 7$ burger to a combo of fries and a drink increases the price almost 4$ son are paying 11$ for burger and fries... Seems a bit steep.   Over all I recommend their burgers. I think they are delicious; well cooked and well prepared. But the price is high for the service and quality of sides.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I think I have Lobby's at least 3 times a week nowadays.  Someone stop me! But seriously it's great.  If I can't make it in; I order their delivery through Tempe Takeout; which takes a bit longer; but it comes hot...and I don't have to drive anywhere!!  My favorite is the bacon burger.  Yum.  Everything is fresh; and I really like the way they cut their pickles. Sounds like a strange comment; but hey; it adds great flavor!   Everyone there is nice; and it's super quick. You can watch them press out the burger on the grill right there in front of you. Anyway...now I'm hungry....think I might order some food!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Tempe; your secret is out. Lobby's Burgers is de-lic-ious!   Dropped in here with my Dude two months back for a quick; definitely not good for you dinner.   Tip: It's behind Gold Bar Espresso. Just drive around the building; and BOOM! Lobby's appears.  Immaculately clean inside. In fact; it seemed that someone was constantly cleaning the place while we were there. Just one gal working the counter; another cooking; and she was very patient with us as we ordered.   I had a Bacon Cheeseburger; lettuce wrapped; and Dude had the Chili Burger. We also tried some of the fries. Pst; split them with a friend; the serving is more than enough!  Lobby uses grass-fed beef; and you can certainly taste the difference. The burger had thick slices of pickles; tomatoes; onions; and fresh lettuce with sliced cheddar; bacon; and Lobby's secret sauce.  By the way; that sauce makes an awesome dip for the fries. Mmm mmm mmm!   This was the best \fast food\"" burger I've had in ages; and for a great price. Dude wasn't a fan of the chili; but I'm a nice lady friend and shared.   I don't know how you could think the mouthful of grease that's In-N-Out is still the \""God of the Burger Industry\"" after eating at Lobby's Burgers.   Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!""",1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,After reading the reviews; I thought we would give this place a try.  Definitely the BEST italian sandwich I have had in years!  The sandwich was everything you want in an italian sandwich; the meat was tender; juicy and flavorful.  I had mine 'wet' or dipped and added grilled onions and sweet peppers.  Not only was the sandwich delicious but chock full of meat and lots of sweet peppers and grilled onions!  I ordered a single burger just to try it.  BIG mistake!  It was sooo good I had to finish it and I was stuffed!  Black tea was great and mixed with the lemonade made a great Arnold Palmer.  French fries were very very good!  My girlfriend loved them.  Please; please check this place out!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I think a burger should be grilled on an open flame...none of this flat fried grilling. BUT  If your going to do that start with a nice round ball of meat; squish it down and cook it to order; just like Lobbys does.   It was one of the best fried burgers I have had. I would say maybe a tad better then 5 guys.   I would get another if ever in the area!  Keep up the good work guys!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I'm a coffee shop fiend; and can be found hanging around Xtreme Bean and Goldbar (though not much of late). After sucking down iced tea and coffee all morning; I (like everyone else out there) tend to need something in my stomach other than liquid and caffeine. When this is the case; I head to Lobby's Beef Burgers and Dogs.   Honestly; I was highly skeptical prior to my first visit. A one off restaurant; with limited word of mouth; that deals in cheeseburgers; dogs; and Italian beef and sausage. Chicago style; at that.  (Ok; I'm a born and raised NY'er; so my bias was seeping in a bit). I decided i was give them a month or 2 after they opened to try them out. After all; they basically deal with fast food; and if If i wanted that; hell; I'd go to McD's. Taco Bell; or Jack's; all of which are within a literal stones throw from Lobby's door.    Finally caved one day; and walked my fedora capped self across the street to Lobby's; ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger; and in all honesty; was taken by surprise. Burger meat at Lobby's is fresh ground; the buns are tasty; the bacon is crisp. And juicy. All of which are vital to a successful Bacon Cheese burger. I normally get my order as a Combo (which includes a Bucket o' Soda; and crinkle fry's only made when you order them). Its almost 3 bucks more; but well worth it. Rarely will a burger; fry's; and a drink leave me stuffed; but Lobby's does it every time.   They also have here what I consider to be the best Italian beef in the valley. Hands down. Now; my opinion may not be equivalent to that of some food critic; but the beef here is awesome. Thinly sliced; cooked in its juices; with cheddar or provolone cheese; its a hell of a sandwich. You can get it Hot or Sweet (if you are a pepper person; which I am); for extra cost;  or you can get it plain. Admit defeat before it gets your table; you're going to need a fork to eat the remains that fall out. Did I mention that the beef is piled in the bread to overflowing? And covered in juice? I mean drowned. Drenched. If you're at all like me and like your Italian beef swimming; Lobby's does it perfectly.   Also; the staff here kicks ass. Everyone is really friendly; helpful; and takes pride in their food. If you're staying to eat there; you won't get out without someone genuinely asking if everything was good.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"I'm mad at myself after seeing their Facebook ad months ago that I wasted time & money on other so-called \Chicago-style\"" establishments. You want real Chicago-style food; great service AND great prices? Well; look no further! THIS is where you need to go. I tried the bacon burger with the works Saturday; & it was the best burger I have had in months. Today I got their Italian beef ... This beats Portillo's by a landslide ... The fries are the best; and try a milkshake; too; you won't be disappointed since it's made with fresh strawberries ... OMG pure Chicago heaven. Bringing a friend from back home (Chicago) there for lunch tomorrow and I think I will either get a chili dog or a Chicago dog ... & another strawberry shake. And I met the owner today (yes; he's from Chi-town) ... What a great guy! Hats off to you; Lobby!! :)""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Disappointing food. The fries are over-hyped. They are good; and different than most places fries but nothing spectacular. The burgers are bland.,1

Total was $19.94 with the BOGO offer from Yelp.  Nice price for the three of us.  The Food:  The burger was well-built; a little on the medium-size range; not too full of stuff as to overwhelm the bun.  Good composition.  Taste was given a serious \""2 thumbs up\"" from my 14-yr-old son.  He did comment on the \""secret sauce\"" which was a surprise to him; but which tasted fine.  ( Possibly a combo of Ranch and ketchup. )  The Italian Beef was very good.  It was tender meat; not too mushy and not too firm; just enough juice to not soggify the bun.  You could taste the spices; but I'm hard-pressed to tell you what they were.  The \""Hot\"" version of the peppers were your standard-fare (pickled?) peppers; not very much heat but a LITTLE bit of kick.  Portion size was on the large side - a hungry man would eat it all; but someone with a lesser appetite might have some to take home.  Not stingy AT ALL on the meat portion; but could have used a few more peppers.  Maybe I ask for \""extra peppers\"" next time.  Fries:  As other Yelpers have stated; they are \""crinkle cut\"" but they are a VERY EXCELLENTLY PREPARED version of crinkles.  Perfect crunch on the outside; airy potato on the inside.  I challenge anyone to find a better version of crinkle-cut fries at any restaurant in Phoenix.  Not the \""best fries EVER\"" but definitely tasty and about as well-cooked as this type of fry can be.  The Chili Dog:  Weak spot here; but not too bad.  Other Yelpers raved about the chili; and it might be good on occasion - but on our visit; it was standard hot-dog-topping chili; nothing to make it stand out.  It was not greasy; so that was a plus; but neither did it make us say; \""Dang; that's some good chili right thar !!!\""  Bun nothing special; and neither was the dog itself.  My daughter only ate about half of it.  Drinks:  Gigantic cups; with a fountain you serve to yourself.  I had the Black Tea and it was decent.  All in all; a very good place to eat.  Clean; well-lit; and mostly excellent food.  We WILL be going back.   They get a solid SOLID 4.5 stars.  Thanks Lobby's !!!!""",0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I only ate here once before I stopped eating meat but it was very yummy. I got the beef in juices sandwich...basically like a French dip but the sauce is already in the sandwich instead of served on the side. They made everything fresh when we ordered it and the staff was very very friendly and helpful in helping us decide what to get. My boyfriend got the cheeseburger and they literally took out a huge ball of meat and shaped it on the grill which was really cool. It's not exactly cheap but it's not expensive either...you would probably end up paying the same for Subway if you got a really meaty sandwich. Overall; tasty and I would have eaten there again if I still ate meat.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Wow- started eating meat again and have been back 4 times already. The french dip is awesome sauce- I prefer to dip mine myself so I order it dry and they give you a lot of au jus on the side. Falls apart there's so much meat! Delicous! I like their cheese fries too- a huge order of piping hot crinkle cut fries with melted cheese all over...finger licking good.  I have recently become obsessed with their Bacon Cheeseburger. This is the only place I have had a real burger from in a long time. Fresh- high quality ingredients from top to bottom. Pickles are huge and fresh; lettuce; tomato; literally every aspect of this is the best quality. I dislike mayo- they have this special house sauce and OH MY it's sooooo good! I drown my burger; plus it's great with the fries. It's got a little spice to it; nice and runny; not thick like mayo. Put everything together and it seriously makes for one of the best burgers I have ever had ANYWHERE!  This is a great local small business and I hope this place continues to do well. It's amazing and they definitely have my support. Eat at LOBBY'S. ;-),0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Food was fantastic!! The Italian Beef sandwich is one of the best Ive ever had. Service was excellent.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Dang; I hate writing low star ratings but I need to get my issues out in the open.  Also; let me just say the food was good and I was really looking forward to finally checking out Lobbys; my low rating is based really on the service we got.   First off; we were the only two people in the whole joint when we ordered so it's not like they were busy and being rushed to finish our orders and that's why they got messed up. Everything about our entire order was jacked up and when I'm starving and I get home to find out; yes I become a little agitated. (I know I SHOULD have checked my burger but really; unwrap everything and check it? I like to give the benefit of the doubt; I mean it is their job)  Everything I didn't want on my burger came on my burger and the things i asked for on the side came all on the burger as well. Same EXACT thing with my boyfriend's burger. The chef was standing right next to the register as well and could hear our order and still everything was wrong and they also forgot to give an order of fries as well.   Super disappointed that I get something I paid for exactly opposite from how I ordered it. Not just one order but both. C'mon.  Would take my $21 back if I could,0

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I'll have to agree with Sue C. (ROTD) and other fellow Yelpers when it comes to rating this locally owned Chicago style restaurant. What more can you ask for other than friendly service and a tasty menu of quality food cooked with TLC.  It is also nice to have a place that opens earlier than the usually lunch time competition. I start work early and can get hungry rather quickly. This place opens at 10 and is always clean and ready to go. The owner told me this is the Chicago way of doing things. Nice!  Love the fact that they use Grass-fed Beef from Iowa in their Burgers. Reminds me of what beef used to taste like back in the days. The Chicago Style Vienna All-Beef Hot Dogs are also very tasty and you can get them with Chili and Cheese when you are in the mood. The Dipped Italian Beef with both types of peppers and some Provolone Cheese is one of my favorites as well.  Yes there are cheaper places in town that start with Jimbo or the letter P. You can get more food there for the dollar but the quality can sometimes suffer a great deal. What I like here is that everything taste fresh and they go out of there way to keep it that way. No chili in a can at this restaurant.  Located in a strip mall off the road with plenty of place to park. I'll pay extra to get the better quality and special attention. Chicago attitude comes free and is always a treat. Did I mention how big the Chili Cheese Fries were the other day? SHAZAM!  4.75 STARS,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Newly opened Chicago style burger; Italian beef and Chicago dogs. Nice menu; friendly staff and very clean place.  The  1/3lb ground chuck burger; cooked to order; was splendid; as is everything in this little place; including the fries! We had the burger; fries and drinks (the combo).  It was one of the best burgers I've eaten; home or away!  Since it is made to order; it is cooked to the degree of doneness desired and the fries (huge portion) can be salted to order when they come out of the fryer; crinkle-cut and golden brown.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Simply stated; if you want a great homemade hamburger; this is It!  Great parking as well.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Was craving a burger so i ordered the bacon burger. The bun looked like it was smashed and it didnt look that appetizing. However I ate it and it had a nice slice of onions in there and veggies but overall I wasnt impressed. But hey I was craving a burger so I got one. On the good note they had sweet potato fries that was good.   The burger was pretty dry so I asked for ranch dressing to put on my burger and that helped. But overall it wasn't super good but it was a burger to eat.   My friend got these chili cheese fries that looked pretty good; I tried a few and it was pretty good.   I'd say the fries were better than the burger. But if your there maybe try something other than the burgers.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,First time visiting Lobby's Burgers. I was invited as part of a Yelp event. After a long day; the girls and I were ready to try a new hamburger spot. My family loves hamburgers. My first impression was of a typically burger spot with a lot of custom signs. My first impression quickly changed as this place was not average. We walked up to the register the gentleman was nice and extremely friendly to me and my girls. My girls ordered. I typically ask when coming to a new place what they recommend. He said everything was good and fresh as they have a select menu. Wasn't what I wanted to hear but I made my selection. Food came and it was good. My girls devoured their burgers and fries. All they could talk about was the shake and how good it was; as they constantly asked me to try it. I had the Bacon Burger; at first it was a little salty for me. After I removed the pickle it was game over. If I'm ever on that side of town I will stop in for a burger and shake. I need to try everything else on the menu. I enjoyed the burger so much that I purchased an extra burger for my dad.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Really good food; but the problem I've had both times I've ordered delivery from them is the food arrived very messy and there was Lobby Sauce spilled inside the bags of food. I will have to try their food at the restaurant and see what I think.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Once again; Yelp comes through for me. I hadn't had an Italian Beef/Sausage Combo for a while; and Lobby's served me up a fantastic one. I ordered mine dipped and sweet; and it was like I had been magically transported to my old neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago. A wonderfully delicious and marvelously messy piece of culinary heaven on earth. The crinkle-cut fries complimented it perfectly; and there were plenty more than I could be comfortable eating.  They hit the nail right on the head with this; and I'll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,My partner and I were in the mood for a good juicy burger and decided to try this place after reading all the great reviews.... We are oh so happy we did! We both ordered Double Cheese Burgers with one as a combo. After waiting a few minutes our burgers were brought out to our table. Oops; they messed up our order...we were brought cheeseburgers instead of double cheeseburgers. I took them back to the counter and let the cook know there was a mistake. He called for the cashier to let her know she made a mistake. They both apologized profusely; and gave me a free drink for the trouble. The cook then brought out our correct order and apologized again. The burger was SO worth it!!! Hot; juicy; and tender! Exactly what we were looking for. Even though our order was messed up I still give them 5 stars. The error was immediately fixed and without attitude. Love it!!! GREAT burgers and very good customer service. We will go back!,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,You're stuck in a sweltering Tempe; starving for dinner; craving a great burger and don't want to heat up the kitchen. I understand completely; grasshopper.   I've come bearing the greatest gift; the answer to your burger dreams; a little taste of true Chicago right in your backyard. Lobby; he is the real Chicago deal! With great food; entertaining stories and excellent service. Even if you call-in for take-out; he waits until you arrive or just before; so your food is hot and juicy.   Burgers cooked spot on as ordered; from fresh Midwestern beef; with a side of fries competing for the headliner because they are that good. He may even ask you if you want them done a little extra; because the snap of that crispy outside; with the chewiness of the inside gets even better. It's a struggle to make it home with even half an order left.  Don't even ask me about the Italian beef sandwich...just eat it and go to heaven yourself; floating in juicy goodness.  The food is always great (If not; he says he'll re-do it for you on the spot); but the guy even better. Treat yourself and go have a chat with Lobby...oh; and while your there; grab a piece of Chicago.  Epilogue: Showed review to girlfriend. Guess what we're having for dinner now...,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I'm always looking for a good burger and thanks to my fellow yelpers I found one!  This place has the most juicy; flavorful burgers around. I'm normally a huge Habit fan but I have to agree with some of the other yelpers and say this place is even better than The Habit!  The service was fast and friendly. Loved the fry sauce!  Ask for the large container of it because it goes fast!  I would suggest to get lots of napkins as you will need them!!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I am always on the prowl for a good burger so when I heard there was a new burger place in Tempe I knew I had to try it out.  The boyfriend and I went to Lobby's on a Friday night. It was not busy but the location doesn't really lend itself to busy. So we were able to walk right in and order. It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.  The burgers were tasty; a nice size - not too big; not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun.  The fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.  The atmosphere was fine; good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.  I hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,So sad I don't live here...I would definatley make this a once a week stop. Establishment is very clean; staff is very friendly and fast. Everything is cooked to order. Burgers are the best I've had in years. (and I travel the US for work) I would advise to get extra special sauce also...( I dip my fries in it) Italian sandwich is beyond delicious but be prepared with at least a dozen napkins..lol  Will always make this a stop when passing through the Phoenix area!!!!!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Dang; this place makes a good burger. I went here last night for the first time; because the boyfriend was craving a burger and Lobbys was the random place he picked out on Yelp. I wasn't expecting much; but holy cow - this was probably the best take out burger I'd ever had. Delicious; generously sized burger with loads of toppings. The grass-fed beef makes a difference. And it was so big! I had that burger around 7pm and wasn't hungry again until; like; 2pm today.   Now; normally my boyfriend and I don't eat so much fast food; but we've been doing a lot of Christmas-related chores this week; running all around town; and we ended up hungry this afternoon while out doing errands. We'd skipped breakfast; and that caught up with us. So when looking for a late lunch; where did we go again? Yes.. back to Lobbys.   I'm not proud of the fact that 100% of my meals within a 16 hour period were burgers. And before going into Lobbys for the second time today; I desperately hoped it wasn't the same people working the counter as had been there last night; so I wouldn't have an audience to my shame. No such luck - same crew exactly. And the guy behind the register totally recognized us (he had helpfully explained the whole punch card promo they run there). But my shame of ordering two of these burgers in less than 24 hours was completely overwhelmed by my carnivorous need for another one of these burgers. They are that delicious.   Thank you Lobbys; for those shamefully delicious burger-filled 16 hours of my life.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,We were in Tempe; AZ to see my son's first Ironman event. As usual; I used Yelp for the highest rated restaurant in the area and we found this place. They use a special sauce that makes the hamburgers more delicious. The bacon cheeseburger is very juicy. I ordered a combo beef and grilled sausage. Yummy! Will definitely recommend trying this place.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Tuesday; 5:30 pm  My buddy and I waltz into Lobby's because he was jonesin' for a burger and didn't want to fight the lines at In-N-Out.  Why; you ask; is Liz B. writing a review for a burger and hot dog joint when she freely admits that she has never liked meat and her parents even paid her to eat burgers as a child? Think of this as a review of French fries; Chris's burger; and my \veggie\"" sandwich and skip this review if you love hot dogs/burgers more than anything.  Service: We were quickly greeted by the two guys behind the counter. Great; friendly service.  Food: Meh. My veggie sandwich consisted of bread; one piece of white iceberg lettuce; two sad tomatoes; pickles; and onions for $2.99. You can add on cheese (provolone) and mushrooms or peppers for $.79 each; making your sad; awful sandwich about $5. My buddy ordered the double burger with provolone; lettuce; tomato; pickles; and hot peppers. He said the hot peppers were good but not very hot. The rest of the fixings were \""meh.\"" As for the quality of the burger; it was a tad bit better than In-N-Out. But you pay at least 2-3 dollars for that \""tad bit.\""  Speaking of paying more; watch out for those add-ons. Your reasonably priced burger can become outrageous for the quality with add-ons.  The fries were devoured; but there are very few fries I do not like.  Overall; I won't be back. This place isn't for me.""",1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby's only does Chicago dogs; burgers; and fries; but they do them extremely well.  It's a clean atmosphere; fast service; good prices; and fantastically tasty food.  These are easily the best burgers I've had anywhere.  I prefer to go on the week days where the owner is doing the cooking.  On the weekend there's someone else there and the food is more like 4/5 instead of 5/5.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Last Visit; No More  Had take out tonight; my wife went to get our order.  I ordered Italian beef; with mayo because it gets dried out. They said no; we will put it on the side. That didn't materialize either. Guess what college punk; it was dry. I'm 37; and I know what I f'ing want.  They should have fulfilled an extremely simple request; it's my money after all. But noooooooo; they know better. At least they think they do. I know better now though; and won't be back.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Without a doubt...best burger in America  The service was outstanding. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Good for families...prices reasonable.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Was extremely psyched to try Lobby's; considering all of the great reviews; but I was sadly disappointed with the results. I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull; featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries; and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable; and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing; but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty; quality burger place; frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce; to boot.. Thanks bro; but I don't need any secret sauce favors.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"I have to say that I really don't understand the hype around this place. Maybe we went there on an off day. Maybe it's because I was born in raised in Chicago and am picky when eating at a place that says they are \chicago style\"".  I ordered an italian beef sweet. My friend ordered a chicago dog and we got a cheese fry. The beef itself was great but there were barely any peppers on the thing. Normally I like my italian beef soaking but this one tasted funny. I couldn't eat it. I just ate the meat inside. The chicago dog was cooked with way too much grease and the bun was soggy. At least they have all of the ingredients which are hard to come by. The cheese fries were decent.   It also took them a lot of time to make a relatively small order.   I have to say that for Tempe; the place is ok. I don't think it's anything special though. I'll have to try it again and see if maybe the service and the food is better in the afternoon instead of at night. I really wanted this experience to be great but alas it was not.""",0

I had the Cheddar Cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The burger came dressed with pickles; onion; lettuce; tomatoes and the special house sauce. It was soooo good. All the ingredients tasted so fresh and vibrant. The burger was literally made-to-order and the bun was toasted on the grill. The fries were made to order as well but since they were thick crinkle cut I can't rave too much about them (but I will say the fries tasted good with the side of special sauce). The restaurant itself was small but very clean with two mounted televisions set to ESPN. They played music so luckily I didn't have to \hear\"" sports in the background. The service was fast and friendly; I wish this place was a little cheaper as this meal cost a little over $9 bucks. Despite my cheapness; I can definitely see myself coming back here again. Side note: they also serve Chicago Dogs and Italian Beef Sandwiches.""",1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Food was delicious; service was excellent!  Owner was super friendly; prices were reasonable.  My burger was so tender it was unbelievable. Give it a try!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,FOOD  Stopped at Lobby's for lunch with a friend a couple weeks ago and had a double burger plain (no veggies) with their sauce.  This place makes good burgers at very reasonable prices and their somewhat spicy sauce was good and gave me a change from my usual drown it in mustard strategy.  The fries were decent; though not as good as Four Peaks fries.   SERVICE  The Service was prompt and quite friendly.  ATMOSPHERE  The place is bright; open; and clean.  Very different from a place like the Chuckbox.  It was empty at lunchtime on Sunday when I was there; but I imagine would be quite busy during the week given its proximity to McClintock highschool.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,MEH....I wanted to love this place. Seriously. Especially with the awesome foursquare and yelp check in they offer.  Just so you aren't as surprised as I was when I got to the register with the check in : You must buy a sandwich and a drink and you will get a hot dog; Italian beef sandwich; or burger for free along with another drink.  Now i am not positive of what was reduced in price but i got a chili cheese burger; Italian beef sandwich and an order of crinkle cut fries with the two drinks for a total of 13ish dollars.       I began eating my OK french fries on the way home...Yes i said it they were Okay. If they were all crispier it might have had my attention.  (This could totally just be the weird time of the month where nothing ever really fills my cravings or taste buds aren't exactly satisfied in the slightest) So here I am a couple minutes from home anxiously waiting to see how this Burger and Italian beef shall taste!         For the big moment of truth.....The chili is wiped off the sides with my crinkle cut fries( not bad not great) I have been spoiled with PITTSBURGH WILLY'S NO BEAN CHILI(SO MUCH BETTER!!)  The chili from lobby's i can tell you right now i do not believe I will crave in the future like I do with PW's.  So after doing this til there are no french fries left; I go in for the big bite....And well...It was A-OK. Probably would have enjoyed it a little more without the chili and the nacho cheese type melted cheese melted on top of this poor poor burger.(I HATE NASTY CHEESE THAT REMINDS ME OF VELVEETA) *shivers*  The Italian beef sandwich is extremely extremely greasy to where my phone accidentally below my bag of food on the way home was almost drenched.  :[ Flavor...ehhh...pass. So i saved it for my boyfriend for when he comes home from a night out. He should love it. :]  My hopes and dreams of finding a place better than five guys was somewhat found especially for the price. Only reason I do not really care for five guys is because of the size of the burger for the price. As for this place their prices are on point. Too bad they don't have cajun spiced crinkle fries. Ohhhh that would be heaven!    Until then i might have to wait another week or two to go back again and try more on the menu or a regular burger.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,In a world full of burger joints; I was skeptical how Lobbys would compare. Nevertheless; Lobbys impressed me.  Their menu is a bit confusing to read; but after standing in line for a few minutes; I ordered the regular cheeseburger; added the grilled mushrooms; and kept the pickles off. I liked the taste a lot; but next time; I will probably order the double burger; because the single wasn't quite enough.  The place itself was very clean (hard to do in a restaurant serving burgers and dogs) and the service was friendly. I recommend checking out Lobbys soon!,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,drove by this place and wanted a burger so i stopped in with friends.    Order a bacon cheese burger which was really good; the house sauce is very tasty too so i'm glad i choose that.  I also ordered the Cheese Fries which was a pretty large portion with melted cheese wiz type cheese on it and very enjoyable.  The rest of the food also looked amazing and i was wishing i ordered the Italian beef after seeing another table with it; so next time i am getting that.  Also being close to ASU was nice since there were a few hot chick working behind the counter.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Without a doubt the best cheeseburger/fries combo this Chicago bred and born carnivore has ever had at a restaurant.  Fresh beef formed into a patty in front of your eyes as it is slapped on the grill.  They come off wonderfully charred and juicy.  It was topped with their fantastic sauce; crisp FRESH lettuce; onion; and tomatoes and...fresh sliced; thick cut; dill pickle slices.  The cheese is real cheddar not processed or liquid cheese.  I order mine \hot\"" which includes homemade giardinara.    The fries are crinkle cut; golden on the outside; hot and steamy inside.  I always get an extra cup of the sauce they put on their burgers to dip the fries in.  Oh My is it good.  Trust me on this...the sauce is the bomb!  Although I love Italian beefs and Chicago dogs I haven't been able to tear myself away from the burger long enough to try.  When I do; I'll update this review...don't hold your breath though.  The help is always very friendly and always checks to make sure everything tastes alright.  I definitely feel much more appreciated here than most valley establishments.    All in all; Lobby's is so good that it has become a regular stop on my weekly lunch rotation.  I'd love it if they opened one up in the far north valley as well.""",0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby's make the best burger in the valley. On top of that the service is exellent and the place is imaculate. Including the restrooms.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great double bacon burger! I love ordering a combo and feeling STUFFED after finishing my food! Great treat! Service is AWESOME! Cheese fries had bacon bits and tasted great! And to think I was going to visit Red Robin tonight. ...No way! Lobby Burgers I'LL BE BACK!,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"After reading the reviews; I was really excited to try this place out.  Unfortunately; just okay.  I opted for the single cheeseburger; fries and drink.  They seem to steam the hamburger pattie; leaving it mushy and making the bun soggy after just a couple of bites.  Definitely could have benefited with some salt/seasoning.  The \spread\"" really does not add much to the burger.  Portions are large and it is true about the chili/cheese fries.  That order is HUGE!""",0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"This place Rocks!  Did a Google search for best burgers in Tempe.  Lobbys came up with great reviews.  My son and I were on the way to downtown Tempe to catch a movie so we decided to stop for dinner.  Wow!  Great food!  I ended up getting an Italian Beef sandwich with hot peppers.  My son got a bacon cheeseburger and then we got one order of chili/cheese fries with crisp bacon on top.  The owner recommended the fry sauce as well.  All I can say is outstanding!  Halfway through the meal my son said; \Dad; we have to come here again!\""  Hats off to the owner of Lobbys whose name is Lobby.  Well done!""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I'm admitting right away that as a vegetarian I am not the best choice of a person to be reviewing this restaurant.  The only meal option for me was a Veggie Sandwich.  It was inexpensive at only $2.99 and simple yet tasty.  It was a roll that was brushed with butter and grilled then topped with fresh tomatoe; lettuce; onion; delicious pickles and secret sauce.    My husband got the sausage and beef sandwich.  He doesn't eat gluten so couldn't have the full effect of eating the dipped bread and thought it was just okay.  My son got the Italian Beef Sandwich dipped and LOVED it.  If you are someone that would enjoy this type of sandwich than I highly recommend eating here.  One of my daughters got a plain hotdog and the other the veggie sandwich like me.  We ordered regular fries and some cheese fries.  I wish I had ordered two cheese fries as they were SO SO SO YUMMY.  Hot; greasy crinkle fries covered in a yummy melted cheese sauce.  Highly recommend!!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby's cooks up the best fried burger in the Phoenix metro area.  Yes; Lobby's fried burgers are that good and I didn't think fried burgers could get better than those artery clogging treats from Smashburger or Fat Burger!  Price wise; Lobby's offers better burgers that are also less expensive than their corporate gourmet burger competition.  The Double Bacon Burger with Provolone is my favorite and the juicy; seasoned fried goodness makes me simply feel happy.  Their chili cheese fries are without peer.  They are simply the best CC Fries in the biz.  There Italian Beef and hot dogs lag slightly behind Portillo's; but are definitely still worth getting.  Lobby's is extremely clean; with a modern interior and 2 flat panel TVs that provide viewers with their sports fixes.  Their entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  I say that if you're planning on eating a good burger and enjoy supporting a local owner who knows how burgers should taste; head to Lobby's.  **Tip 1**  They don't serve beer; wine or booze.  That might be reason enough to take your order to go and enjoy that burger with a brew at home.  Or you can flask it and add a little something to your fountain drink!  **Tip 2**  Take a look at the wall of fame where patrons have eaten 9 pattie burgers in 9 seconds....I'm exaggerating; but not by that much!   **Tip 3**  If you can't possibly eat a double burger and a full sized Italian Beef in one sitting; order it all and take the beef home.  It's damn good reheated.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I was wavering between 3.5 and 4 stars for this joint.  Having lived in Chicago for a few years and watching Z's close down a couple years ago in Tempe; I was happy this place opened up.  It was refreshing to go to a place that dipped your Italian beef.  Is it the best that I've had?  No.  But it's way better than Luke's mess of an Italian beef.  (Oh Al's; how I miss you.).  Couple negative reviews here about the dip.  One obviously hadn't had Chicago-style Italian beef.  But I agree with the other poor review - Lobby's; please ask before you go ahead and dip that badboy.    Now; the hot dog.  Biggest knock; they don't use Vienna dogs.  And there's something a little ... off ... about the sport peppers.  But otherwise; pretty darn good; though Luke's might be a tad better.  And never; ever; get the Sonic Chicago dog.  So; quality-wise; a solid 3.5 but a .5 boost for bringing serviceable Chicago food to the Valley.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great service;  great food; decently Priced menu. Try the bacon double cheeseburger!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Lobby's burgers are delicious. The service is top-notch. The owner is often behind the counter and he and the other staff are very friendly. I used to love this place.   Two problems: I chose Lobby's originally because they serve grass-fed beef and that means a lot to me. I choose grass-fed beef in my home and if I can't eat grass-fed at a restaurant; I choose something else. The menu says they serve USDA grass-fed beef. But; the owner told me that the one he buys his beef from actually gives them a little corn near the end of their feeding period. This violates the laws about USDA grass-fed beef; so it looks like they are using the \USDA grass fed\"" label fraudulently.   The other problem: they refuse to have gluten-free buns. They suggested instead that I use lettuce. A lettuce wrap is just not a bun. It's not the same. I am willing to pay extra for a gluten-free bun; but Lobby's won't give me that option; so they have lost my business.""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Just discovered this place by wondering on yelp; and I must say I loved it. I ordered the italian beef and it was soo delicious; i wasn't expecting so much flavor in the meat; it was very tender and juicy. You have the option to dip your sub in the meat's juice or have it on the side.  The place looked very nice and clean. The people who worked there were really nice.  I would definitely would come back here.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I initially was torn with this place. However; after trying other places in the Phoenix area for Italian beef; I can say that this place is simply ok. The prices are a bit high for what you get and the service has never been that friendly. The Italian beef is a bit dry and is not sliced thin enough. Additionally; I was not impressed with the Chicago dog. If I pay 3.50 for a hot dog; I would expect it to be fairly large. This was not the case at all. I have gotten bigger hot dogs at costco for 1.50 with a soda included. Anyways; been here twice now and I don't think I would return. I would rather drive the extra 10 miles to Taylor Street. Once you have eaten there; you will know what good Italian Beef should be like and its alot more reasonable price wise.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,My husband & I tried this place together and we keep coming back for more!!  I LOVE the italian beef sandwich his favorite is the the chili cheeseburger!!  Excellent customer service; very clean and in a great location.  Will definitely recommend to friends and family.  Can't wait to go back for the Chicago Dog..YUMMY!! =),1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I'd heard a lot of good things about this place; and so I drove out there yesterday to see what 'it's all about'. Pulling up to the place encouraged me. Holes in the wall are often great finds; and believe me I was in the mood for a hot dog.   The people who were there were awesome. They had great personalities and one of them offered me a chili sample when I was going between two things to order. It was great--not the best; but great.  I ordered the chili dog and I asked for no cheese--they only carry processed cheese and I hate that stuff.  It was on my hotdog anyway when I got it (and keep in mind I was the only person in there and I thought I had been pretty clear about what I didn't want). I took a bite and I couldn't eat anymore. The cheese was all over and disgusting. The meager hot dog bun disintegrated under the weight of the chili and the whole thing doped out of my hands in a soggy mess.  Very disappointing.  So while the service was good (except the mistake) the food left me hungry. I immediately left and went to dinner at Sweet Tomatoes--so I could get the cheese taste out of my mouth.,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Ok; so I wrote a review after going to Lobby's the first time. I had a bad experience with the food but a great one with the employees.   After receiving a very nice letter from one of the managers (or owner; not quite sure) I returned to give Lobby's another shot. For the first round I got the Italian Beef sandwich. Here's the rundown:  1. Beef was very very tender and there was no fat present. It just fell apart. Lovely. 2. Very; very salty. I stopped eating everything except the beef because of this; and I still refilled my drink twice. 3. The bun withstood the juice much better then the hot dog bun had. I was pleased.  So as far as that goes; I dunno. It would have been better if there wasn't so much salt. I give it a C+.  But because at this point I had tried a hot dog; and a sandwich I figured I should at least try the burger before writing this place off (again).   Good decision!  The burger was fantastic. Run down:  1.The beef was perfectly cooked (and seasoned).  2.The lettuce was crisp and fresh; the tomatoes were thick cut and fresh.  3.The grilled onions were amazing.  I took one bite and realized that Lobby's Beefy burgers are amazing. And I would definitely return for one of these. I give the burger an A+.  And as always; the service was nice and friendly.  So if you just want a good burger; and don't care about the other stuff (fries looked good but I didn't get any); Lobby's may be a good choice. But if you want a hot dog or sandwich it may be best to get that somewhere else.  PS: The store is VERY clean.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,After driving around for ten minutes on the wrong side of the parking lot; the girl and I finally found this hidden gem in Tempe. But I am glad we did.  I've been here twice so far and both times the burgers have been great. first time I got the chili burger and the second time I got a bacon burger with mushrooms. Both burgers were great. Good flavor and very fresh toppings. Admittedly I was a little underwhelmed with the chili but it may have been an off night so will give i another try. The fries are great especially with the Lobby's sauce. Both times I've been in the customer service has been excellent and very friendly. I've heard they make really good dogs and sandwiches as well so will definitely have to give them a shot sometime.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Grilled mushroom burger and cheese fries. Ask for the lobby sauce. I've tried almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed once. The guy grilling definitely knows what he's doing. If you call in your order they'll wait to start cooking so that when you get it home its hot and fresh.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Decided to stop by based on all the great reviews. First off a small joint ; clean and friendly. I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired. It tasted like...maybe the meat had been cooked with onions and peppers used on hogie style sandwiches; bad blend of something that left a bad taste.   Oh well; onto the next burger joint.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Tried this while in town for for business based off of Yelp reviews. Had it delivered via the delivery service advertised on the business owners website huge mistake. I had a double burger which was decent the meat was really good but my friends had chili cheese dogs which for $5 I'm sorry should have been a lot bigger and a bowl of chili which seemed more like a side instead of a meal. the total for the three of us for dinner was a little more than 50 including delivery fees and it simply wasn't worth it. I think if we had actually gone into the restaurant we would have been happier it would have been cheaper and we would have had a better idea of what we were getting. That aside the chili was really good the beef was really good I truly believe it was just the delivery service that made it a bad experience if I ever try them again I will definitely go to the restaurant.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Fresh burgers! This place is awesome. The service is always friendly. The owner seems to greet everyone as they enter. I recommend this place to everyone looking for great burgers.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Yum. This is the best Chicago style dog I've had outside of Illinois. That neon green relish? It's called \nuclear relish\"" and it is totally at home on top of that poppy seed bun. Son had the bacon cheeseburger with their special sauce (which IS NOT 1000 Island dressing). Amazing. Fresh beef; juicy; hand cut pickles...and those french fries! You totally think that they will be a public school cafeteria grade spud but that is not the case. Fresh; hot; perfectly salted; real potatoes and the price to feed a family with this quality of food was highly reasonable. Also; you can never go wrong with a bucket o' soda to wash all of it down with and that's what you get with the combo.  I totally recommend. Just don't affect a weird \""da bears\"" accent when you're ordering your food. That makes you the person who tries to order in all Spanish at Macayo's. They don't care and then people like me write about you in yelp reviews.""",0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Where do I start? Well; thanks to these reviews and my need for something hearty to take care of m hangover stomach; I chose Lobby's for my lunch. My food was made to order; and everything was flawless. It's the kind of burger you dream of. I got the bacon cheddar burger and fries w/ fry sauce. I paired it with a bottled mexican coke I got from the gas station next door because I couldnt hold a fountain drink on my bike. I just finished my meal and I can say without exaggeration; that it was as good as sex. I'll definitely be back!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobbys first grabbed my eye when dropping off a Blockbuster movie. The location had been vacant for some time after Extreme Pita left. I was excited to hear this was a burger place.   I finally gave the place a try tonight and wasn't disappointed. I had the double burger with cheese. All burgers come with lettuce; tomato; onion; large pickles slices and homemade sauce on a sesame bun.  The meat is high quality (not frozen); seasoned  and cooked to perfection. Topped with cheese and you have a real delight. After I ate my burger; I wish I had more!   I'm a big fan of the crinkle cut french fries. I haven't had those in a LONG time. I found the fries a bit too salty. I like salt on my fries; but this was a tad much. You receive a very large portion of fries (perfect for me). You could probably even split the fries with another person if you wanted.   You can make any meal a combo meal (fries/drink) for $2.79 more.  The price of the burgers and hots dogs are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting.  Based on the size you order; you're looking  at $4-6.50 w/o cheese.  I do wish there was more than just 1 size of drink and not in a styrofoam container. I could go for something a little smaller than a super big gulf size-32 oz.  I hope this place does well as they make great food. This isn't an ideal location unless you know about the place; but I think Lobbys can do well with some more publicity and word of mouth.  The reviews on Yelp are a good start.  If you like burgers as much as I do; give this place a shot!   4.5 stars!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I stopped by for a burger with my daughter; but then I saw a picture of the Italian Beef  sandwich and ordered that instead.  I also split a hotdog and chili cheese fries with my daughter.  Honestly; I do not get people loving hot dogs.  The toppings were great; but the hot dog was just a hot dog.   The Italian beef sandwich was amazing!  The toppings were great with onion; sweet and hot peppers.  It was just sopped in juice.  Yum!  The fries were pretty amazing; but I am definitely going back just for the Italian beef.  Very impressed!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Good burgers and I'm told the Italian beef is good too but the service is not so good; it's a big high school hangout during the weekday afternoons and they don't cater to customers that come in after 9:30 pm. My email on their website also went unanswered; which was another customer service turnoff to me.  Rosatti's and DeFalcos also have very good Italian beef and there are other good burger joints in the area for this one to be a staple for me.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great place! Quick service.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,First time to write a review on Yelp ... And first time to Lobby's. How appropriate a joint for my first review!  Recently moved deeper into Tempe & an updated search on Yelp provided us with new places to try!   Saw the photos of the burgers at Lobby's and was shocked. If these burgers match up to their pics ... We are in the money!  We ordered a double cheeseburger and a Chicago-style hot dog. Both. Amazing.   If you want a burger that tastes like you're enjoying a premium back-yard professional-chef char-grilled stack... This is your burger.   And the hot dog. Fresh. Hefty amount of toppings. Flavorful. Delicious.   Go. Try. Enjoy.   Thumbs up.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The burger was wonderful. I placed an order for delivery. It was the most expensive burger I have ever ordered for delivery. There is a $5.00 delivery fee and a $10 minimum to place your order. I was really lazy because after reading that I went ahead and placed my order anyway. The sloth in me won that day. My food arrived 45 minutes later still warm. The burger was prepared to my liking. The mystery sauce was actually pretty spicy in a good way. The fries were Ore Ida crinkle cut which I liked. It reminded me of being a kid. The ice tea though is not sweetened and as a  Southern lady I spat that right back out.  Definitely will be going to the location to try again.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me. It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder; it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about.   While planning an office hours at Lobby's; I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat; the personal attention to each patty; Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care.   So the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof; there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours; I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do; and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive.   Moving on to the grand finale; the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation; I got it with provolone and kept everything on it; especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles; lettuce; tomato and the special sauce; the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy; full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious; but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend; you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up.   I can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger; I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime; I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp. Bravo Lobby!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!  I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins; you can see i've frequented there since.   I've tried a lot of other \great\"" burgers -- 5 Guys; Smashburger; etc - but IMHO; none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys.   The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun; the taste; the way the cheese melts over the whole patty; the special sauce; and the burger itself.   And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and \"" He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows\"".   I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley.   Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to.""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Today I had the Chicago Dog and while it was good I probably wont be ordering it again. It's slightly pricy for what it is. I've had the italian beef and the burger on previous visits and enjoyed these items much more. The burgers and beef sandwiches are juicy and delicious. They also have my favorite type of fries- crinkle cut! Yum!  My BF and I were the only ones there the entire time of our visit which is a shame because the food here is good!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Wow; serious burgers served here! If you are in the mood for a burger then i can't think of a better place to go. They also serve italian beef; chicken sandwiches; sausage sandwiches and chicago style dogs (I'll have to try that next time; they might serve as a respectable hold-over when a proper trip to johhny's isn't in the cards). Everything is made from scratch when ordered.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I definitely recommend this place to all burger lovers. The service was fast and friendly. Burgers were the juiciest I've had in a while. The fries were meh; but I think that's been said. A great hidden find; look forward to going back soon.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The place: amazingly clean. Friendly; competent (and; it must be said; seriously cute) order girls. Lobby is a great guy to chat with.  The fare: the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers is fantastically juicy and well seasoned without being overwhelming. The chili burger is topped with just the perfect amount of chili; not a little dab like some places and not completely burying the burger like others. The fries; well; they could be better; maybe a little more crisp. Need to try a dawg next time I go (which will probably be very very soon). Yeah; Lobby's costs more than McD's or similar; and it's well worth it.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby- ya burgahs are da bomb...da bomb... nuff said.   The gentleman in front of me was regaling the owner with the deliciousness of his intended order...So; how could I turn down such a glowing review. I went with the burger and he got it right; the burger is da bomb. It is astounding how fresh the  bun; the pickles and lettuce are..crispness you can take and the burger is juicy.. The fries are absolutely addicting. Crinkle cut and taste amazing. Pippin' hot.. I love this place; Lobby ya burgahs are da bomb!,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Are all burgers created equal? NO! Lobbys does it simple; and right. There isn't anything fancy about this burger and dog joint; it's in a old strip mall in tempe where they don't get too much foot traffic; but don't let that fool you. Their menu isn't too big; but they do have choices for pretty much everyone; including a veggie sandwich. I get the burger when I go and it is thick; juicy; and cooked to perfection.  My only gripe is they don't have a kid's menu so I have to order a $5 hotdog for my kid and he only eats 1/2 of it.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Best Burger in the East Valley!  I found out about this place on Yelp and decided to try it out last night on a whim. It is located right across the street another place in the area I frequent so I was shocked that I never heard of this place before.  When I first stepped in I was kindly greeted by the staff and owner (who was also the chef) and we exchanged a few pleasantries before I ordered. You can see him cooking clear as day from any seat in the restaurant which is fairly uncommon and impressive for a burger joint. I ordered a simple burger with cheddar cheese and combo'd it with fries. The total was under $10 but I would have gladly paid more for it.  The taste and flavor of this burger was superb. Better than any other burger place I've been to. It puts Islands; Five Guys; In n Out to shame in both taste; presentation; and value. I couldn't stop eating this burger. The beef was fresh; packed with flavor; and seasoned beautifully. It was a great cut of meat that was complimented very well by the perfectly toasted buns and their special burger sauce. The fries were fresh; plentiful; incredibly crispy; and included a ramekin of their sauce for dipping (which I quickly ran out of).  I've never felt more satisfied and pleased after finishing a meal. The burger was portioned and perfectly sized and I probably could have wolfed down another order of fries with sauce easily.  The best part about my visit was that the owner was amazingly kind and friendly. We chatted afterwards and he was genuinely passionless about his food; something that I think a lot of other burger places have lost through the \automation\"" of delivery.  I can't recommend this place highly enough. It is definitely worth a drive out here. I will be sure to frequent this place from now on!""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,This place is a pretty nice little spot in Tempe. They are in the building where extreme pita used to be next to blockbuster.  I came based on the yelp reviews and ordered an italian beef with gardinera. It was very good. Nice and wet and the gardinera is nice and hot. The fries were also fantastic. there was so much food that i couldn't even finish on a day where i went in hungry.  It was also fun that they were doing a Man vs Food style competition all day with a challenge to eat a 3lbs burger with toppings in 10 minutes. Two guys tried it while i watched and made for a fun time. The staff made sure it was a fun event.,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I was SO disappointed. Like another yelp review; I ordered take-out... I asked for a bacon cheese burger... and there was NO bacon OR cheese. Man what a bummer. And it tasted as though one side of my burger was overly salted. I had to get water in the middle of eating it.   The side that was not overly salted; was pretty good... If they got my order right; they would have gotten 3 stars.   But the chili cheese fries were to die for; they are pretty bomb!!!  My recommendation: don't get take out. Eat it there and you will have a much better experience.   I'd go back for the fries... and get the burger elsewhere (if I was doing carry-out).,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Took the family to dinner here tonight.  I have passed it a few times; and finally stopped in.  The prices were good as we fed our family of 5 for 28 and some change; granted my two boys split a bacon cheeseburger; but it was plenty for the two of them; and I quote \mom this is one of the best burgers I have ever tasted\"" and \""mom; this is super yummy!\""  The crinkle cut fries were made to order; absolutely delicious.  My husband and I shared the \""burger\"" and we were super impressed.  The pickles were fantastic; the cheese was real cheddar; shoot; everything was freaking fantastic.  We also had to try the \""Chicago dog;\"" I am not a big sweet relish person and next time would opt for the chili cheese dog; but if you like that sort of thing it was great!  We also got a side of chili cheese fries; the chili was great; and cheese and chili were both piled high on top of those delicious fries.  We will for sure go back; and I hope that they make it!""",0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The first time I visited Lobby's was around a year ago; I tried the double bacon cheeseburger and fries.... I was hooked!  I think a great burger needs to be grilled; but this fried burger was one of the best I have eaten.  I have been back several times to try different menu items; the Italian Beef is phenomenal (if you can handle a little heat; be sure to try it with the spicy peppers) and their chili fries are superb!  The owner (Lobby) is usually there to make sure you enjoy your meal and the staff is very pleasant.  The restaurant is always very clean; which in my opinion is a great indication that the owner really cares about his business.  One time I went there for carry out; I got home to find that a few of the items I ordered weren't prepared as I instructed (special sauce when I asked for none; no cheese when there should have been etc). Luckily I'm very close to the restaurant so I drove back and got a sincere apology and my food order corrected; along with a free order of fries.  No biggie; I know mistakes happen and how they handled their error was perfectly acceptable.  I will continue to visit Lobby's for their awesome food!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I just went for the first time last night.  I normally eat real healthy but I felt like having a cheat day and like a man I was craving meat.  The question was posed by my girlfriend; was this worth the cheat?  The answer is sort of.  We split a double burger and an order of fries.  We still couldn't finish the fries because the order was huge.  The burger was nicely cooked and the fries were perfectly crispy on the outside.  I did enjoy their house sauce as well.  However; this was a great big grease ball.  Yes I was in a burger shop but I wasn't expecting that much.  Lastly; the service was speedy and the food came out nice and hot.  I gave bonus points on cleanliness as well.,1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I am typically a Chicago hater because they take very delicious things; mix it up just to be different; and then pretend it is better.  Almost every place I have tried around here has been crap but I have not been able to tell if the entire concept sucks or just those establishments.  I am always looking to try the most authentic in order to make a better assessment of their style.  I already know their pizza sucks; no need to investigate further.  But; the dogs have always intrigued me.  I checked out Lobby's based on the Yelp reviews.  First trip there I had a Chicago Dog and chili fries.  Both were quite good.  I still think the dogs are way over done especially since the actual dog isn't that good or special; but the toppings seemed fresh and were tasty enough.  Of course with all that wetness the bun blows out on the bottom which irritates me a bit.  The entire purpose of the bun is to hold the hotdog; if it fails; the entire thing fails.  But; the flavor was good so I approve; even dispite the mess.  (Ted's is still the real deal for REAL dogs)  I went back another time to try the Italian Beef that I hear so much about.  It was alright and similar to a french dip without the dip.  It seems to be another dish that Chicago-ans hijacked; renamed; and made it a little less good.  With that being said; it was still tasty; just not the best.    In summary; the food isn't too pricey and is quite tasty.  Will I abandon the traditional and superior styles of food for this stuff?  Absolutely not; but it is always good to mix it up.  If I wan the best though I will stick with getting my pizza; hot dogs; baseball; and football from NY/NJ.   This place is clean; close and the staff is friendly.  I may be a little tough on the Chicago stuff; but this place is alright in my book.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"I'm from Chicago and found myself craving a taste from back home. I had no clue where to start my search as there have been a few \Chicago style\"" places that have popped up around AZ and faded away... but after having a taste of Lobby's I hope they're around for a while.  The service was friendly and they cooked my food fresh. The wait was minimal and I was really pleased. I was craving Portillo's and this came kinda close... well; close for AZ lol.  I ordered the Chicago style hot dog; cheeseburger; fries and a drink. Everything tasted really good and just like back home.  If you're craving something that taste authentic to Chicago please check this place out. I don't think the hrs are listed on their site; but they're open until 10p.""",1

eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Excellent burgers. Juicy; hot and fresh. Ordered it bun less and got a nice lettuce bun. Crispy crinkle cut fries.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"I walked up to the counter and said; \I'll have an Italian Beef; Hot; with provolone and hot Giardiniera; Full Dip\""!  Lobby (I don't know if that's his name; but he's the owner and the place is called \""Lobby's\""; so...) looked at me; puzzled and said \""what part of Chicago are you from\""?  I know...ending a sentence with a preposition...so authentically Chicago!  He was puzzled because my accent ain't exactly South Side...but I've spent a lot of time in Chicago over the years and one of the things that I developed there is a taste for Italian Beef Sandwiches; made just the way they make them at Lobby's...WOW is that good!  I was extra fortunate today; because he had just taken 50 lb's. of roast beef out of the oven; to  slice up for my sandwich (well; OK; and other peoples sandwiches; too)...and I got to stand there and snorkel in the aroma as they unwrapped the top of the roasting pans; right on the counter in front of me!  The aroma of roast beef; oregano; pepper; onion; garlic...in other words; exactly what you want your roast beef to take a bath in!  Lobby makes his own marinade and roasts the beef wet; low and slow in a method that I like to call \""nearly perfect\""...he is proud of his place and of his food; and it really shows!  For me; it always starts and ends with the food itself.  Oh sure; I like to be pampered with spectacular service and surroundings as much as the next over-fed; self-absorbed; slightly insecure Brahmin; and the service was good and the place is clean and bright...but it really is about the food.  And the food here is remarkable...a simple menu of Beef; Hamburgers and Hot Dogs...done the way that Lobby grew up loving in his hometown of Chicago and done with loving care...the result is a Chicago style food experience that almost can't be matched here in the desert!  I do like my sandwiches and I did; would and will go out of my way to drop by Lobby's for their signature item (BTW; notice the name...it isn't Lobby's Burgers and Dog's...make no mistake; the Italian Beef is the big deal here).  While there are couple of places around here that make an Italian Beef that comes close to Lobby's; none of them have invited me to smell the wonderful aroma of the beef just as it comes out of the oven and that made Lobby's a 5 star experience today!  And for those of you concerned about where my nose has been; well; I keep my nose clean...at least that's what I tell my parole officer.""",1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I was in search for the best burger in Tempe and I'm positive this place is it. It has a decent size menu. Burgers; hot dogs and The Italian Beef are their specialties.  1st time there I ordered just a regular burger with the works.Grilled onions are a must! Trust me.  Bun was fresh; burger was juicy right into the first bite. I'm not a big fan of crinkle cut fries but these were decent. They had this special dipping sauce that kinda reminded me of the Big Mac Sauce. All in all; real good food. My combo was around $9 but it was worth it. Definitely a must try,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,my experience here was a lot better than I ever expected. The owner im assuming is the one who took our order and was more than happy to help us with any of out questions. the italian beef sandwich with hot peppers is the best i have had outside of portillo's which is originated in chicago so that is a huge compliment. I will be back.,0
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great burgers... Pretty good fries.  Nice Chicago style hamburger place.  Very comparable to what you would find in the Chicagoland area. Service was good as well.  Best burger I've had in a while!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The closest thing you can get to being in Chicago! Great Italian Beef; very good service and people that care. If you want an Italian Beef; Burger; or Hot Dog; then make your way here. Oh yea; and the fries with fry sauce were awesome as well!,1
eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,So; I was invited back by the owner and I went.  Well; the dogs were good.  My wife had the beef.  Same thing.  This is Chicago; not Philly.  Stop drenching the bread in the ajus.  Ask first.  Alot of us like the sandwich dry or with the ajus on the side.  Also; the guy behind the counter was flirting with the evidently new young woman who was taking our order.  She was distracted enough to screw up our order and forget the fries.  Also; while we ate the two of them were flirting back and forth instead of checking with us as to our food.  They only spoke again to us after we got up and left.  We were there for about 1/2 hour.  Only one other customer in the place during that time.  So; I am concerned this place may not make it.  A good sauce is a start; but there's not enough here to keep me coming back.  Sorry.  I tried it again and it's not up to par with Chicago.,0

FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,As you may be able to tell from my other reviews; Indulge closing sent me into a deep; that-was-my-favorite-place-ever depression. I just wanted to know WHY and was left without any answers; like my boyfriend had just broken up with me and not given me any closure. I had never had a burger so delicious. Every place I go is measured against Indulge; and no one ever stacks up. When I saw this place opening; the font felt familiar and my conspiracy theories kicked in. Maybe my beloved Indulge was opening up under a new name. I have since been assured that is not at all the case (more tears). We finally got over there to try Burgers N Fries tonight.  I love the doors (saw that someone didn't like those) and the open feeling. The menu on the mirror is a bit hard to read; but I know what I want so no biggie. We ordered and everyone was very nice. The food came really fast and the girls came by our table a bunch and were SUPER nice. Now....to the big moment...the burger was GREAT. I hate overly complicated burgers or burgers that taste like they were cooked at home. This was neither - it was just good; basic and delish. If I were to say Indulge burgers were 9.5; this burger was an 8.75 or 9. The closest I have been able to find since Indulge closed. I will say maybe the cheese slices could be a bit thicker; maybe a tiny bit more cheese. Anyhow; I actually LOVED that it wasn't this massive thick burger. I can't eat all that anyhow (and really; shouldn't we all stick to smaller portions my fellow Americans?). The men can get the double if they need it.   The fries were good and the shake was great (maybe a tiny bit too thick which sometimes can make it not as cold as I'd like). I love custard; mmm!   Our meal for two people came to about $30; which did kind of feel over-priced. But; knowing this is the closest I have been able to get to my fave burger; I am willing to pay it!   One thing I will add specific to other reviews about natural beef. It is a HUGE deal; and I will ONLY eat at places with natural/grass fed beef. If you don't care; you should.   I hope they make it; don't be the second to break my heart (stomach)!   PS I am still wondering why my boyfriend Indulge broke up with me. WTF happened to them? I thought things were going so great with us. ;),0

I had a double mushroom burger with fries and a drink. Not much taste to the undersized burger and the fries were just OK.

FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,"Style over substance. This restaurant has a lot of polish to it but it's missing a lot of details that would make it more enjoyable for the diner.  The menu is printed on a 6' tall mirror as you walk in. It's not easy to read the menu especially when the mirror is reflecting a dark background; like dark clothes that you're wearing. I went safe and just ordered the All American Burger and shared a large fries with Parmesan and herbs. Also ordered an iced tea.  I was bummed that there weren't burger patty options on the menu; like bison; buffalo; turkey; etc. (If they were there I couldn't see them - see paragraph #2)  When you get to the register to order; you do get a nice warm greeting and friendly service. However; you can't see the menu anymore and it's a bit frustrating. They have two monitors on the back wall showing random product images but those images don't seem relevant or captivating; and even seem washed out from either poor monitors or poor photography. I think they'd be better served by having menu panels where customers are used to seeing them vs. a picture of ripe tomatoes.  I went to get my iced tea and found that they use Coke's bag-in-box Gold Leaf tea. So; it's \natural\"" burgers and \""formerly natural\"" iced tea. I don't drink soda and I like good iced tea so I am dismayed when restaurants choose bag-in-box tea products vs one of the many quality fresh brewed products that are out there.  The burgers and fries came out in a timely manner with friendly service. The food was delivered on half sheet pans - one for my friend's hot dog (which was in a small paper tray); one for the fries; one for my burger.   The burger is tiny; like McD's Quarter Pounder sized. I'm not looking for a huge burger but this little 4\"" bun looked even worse sitting on the acreage of an otherwise empty half sheet pan. The presentation was awful. The burger did taste good but for the size it was more like a $4 burger especially since it doesn't include a side of fries. The fries were good and worth ordering again.  I want to like the place. It's nice with the open garage doors; the Big Ass Fan on the ceiling; the friendly service. But it seems that they put their money on the glitz of the project vs. on things that make dining better; and easier.""",0

The menu is printed on a 6' tall mirror as you walk in. It's not easy to read the menu especially when the mirror is reflecting a dark background; like dark clothes that you're wearing. I went safe and just ordered the All American Burger and shared a large fries with Parmesan and herbs. Also ordered an iced tea.  I was bummed that there weren't burger patty options on the menu; like bison; buffalo; turkey; etc. (If they were there I couldn't see them - see paragraph #2)  When you get to the register to order; you do get a nice warm greeting and friendly service. However; you can't see the menu anymore and it's a bit frustrating. They have two monitors on the back wall showing random product images but those images don't seem relevant or captivating; and even seem washed out from either poor monitors or poor photography. I think they'd be better served by having menu panels where customers are used to seeing them vs. a picture of ripe tomatoes.  I went to get my iced tea and found that they use Coke's bag-in-box Gold Leaf tea. So; it's \natural\"" burgers and \""formerly natural\"" iced tea. I don't drink soda and I like good iced tea so I am dismayed when restaurants choose bag-in-box tea products vs one of the many quality fresh brewed products that are out there.  The burgers and fries came out in a timely manner with friendly service. The food was delivered on half sheet pans - one for my friend's hot dog (which was in a small paper tray); one for the fries; one for my burger.   The burger is tiny; like McD's Quarter Pounder sized. I'm not looking for a huge burger but this little 4\"" bun looked even worse sitting on the acreage of an otherwise empty half sheet pan. The presentation was awful. The burger did taste good but for the size it was more like a $4 burger especially since it doesn't include a side of fries. The fries were good and worth ordering again.  I want to like the place. It's nice with the open garage doors; the Big Ass Fan on the ceiling; the friendly service. But it seems that they put their money on the glitz of the project vs. on things that make dining better; and easier.""",0
FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,Decided to take the family here after receiving a coupon and was intrigued by the all natural concept. We loved the decor and the place seemed clean. We were immediately disappointed when we discovered the lack of a kids menu. We were informed by the staff that we could order anything plain. So we get to pay $6 for a burger for our 6 year old. Same with the hot dogs. You pay for a Chicago dog and then tell them to hold all the good stuff.  Fries are separate although the large seemed to feed us all. We ordered waters and were presented with 5 shot glass sized plastic cups. I realize they make money on drinks but this is Arizona!  We need water.   The only saving grace is that the food was pretty good. The burgers were small but had good flavor.  Just wondering how American cheese made into an all natural place.  We may come back; but I doubt we will make a special trip.,0
FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,Yummy! Had the larger cheese burger and it was delish. Hot; juicy and fresh. Staff is passionate about their product and so friendly and happy. Ordering is super easy and we were served quickly. Cute patio area to enjoy a nice glass of vino. I am only able to eat grass fed beef and this is my new favorite spot. Will definitely be coming back. And....the frozen custard was fabulous!,1
FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,Ok; you might think that 5 out of 5 stars is over the top; but in this case it is merited.  To me; Burger N Fries combines a clean; family oriented atmosphere with friendly staff and great food at a good price.  There are no misses; so 5 out of 5!  Some details.... The concept of grass feed beef was an immediate draw and the flavor of the meat is fantastic.  To me; the meat makes all the difference.  The bacon used on the Big Big tastes great too and the vegetables on the burger are always fresh.  A great bang for the buck!  The staff is friendly and not only delivers your order quickly; but they are there to help out with anything else you might need.  The beer selection is good; with nice craft beers on tap and in bottles.  I've had two sides; french fries and onion rings; and both were generous servings and both tasted great.  I'm not a big onion ring fan; but for some reason I really like their rings; especially dipped in some of their hamburger sauce.  (Which I always get an extra side of because it tastes great!)  Burger n Fries quickly became a favorite food stop for my boys and I.  The food is consistently prepared well and tasty!  I highly recommend you stop by for a bite!,1
FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,I normally visit fast food places for burgers just because of its easy however every once and a while I splurge for a nice one. I tried this place tonight with a roommate and the burgers were really good. Not the absolute best I have ever had but probably on par with the juiciest. The mAnager greeted us and service was pretty fast. The coolest thing I think was the open atmosphere though. I would definitely go back.,1
FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,I had the pleasure of trying Burger n Fries yesterday. Since the products are all fresh and natural; I loved eating all that I ordered. It's hard to find onion rings like these and I enjoyed eating every single one.,0
FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,Really good burger and fries. I thought the burger was a little small; but very good. I got a sample of the seasonal beer before committing. I really liked it as well. Service was excellent. The young woman at the checkout checked on us later to make sure everything was good.  I will probably be back.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,First time here. Greeted promptly. Menu can be confusing. Clean comfortable surroundings. Contemporary decor instead of the phony Asian motif. Soft jazz music.   The staff members were all very nice.   I ordered the chicken lo mein with pot stickers and veggie spring rolls.   The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned. Fresh cooked to order. Hot and fresh. Soft delicate noodles; enhanced with mushrooms; carrot and green onion. Tasty sauce that was sweet and ginger-like.   Delicious side dishes. The pot stickers are deep fried and not the ordinary pan fry. Crispy spring rolls filled with not too crunchy veggies. Both sides served with dipping sauce.   Jars of hot chili sauce are provided if you like a spicy bite.   Serving size of the main dish was plenty. They also have a smaller portion size available.   Unlike Panda Express; which is more cafeteria style; here you are served at your table with real plates and flat ware.    Regular bowl of lo mein $8.69; 2 spring rolls $3.79; 2 pot stickers $1.99.   Thank God no nasty dry fortune cookies forced on me. What a relief!,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,While I was visiting AZ a while back; a co-worker treated me to lunch here.  I loved it!  I wish they would bring this franchise to Chicago.  Basically; you order at the register; they give you a number; then they bring it to your table.  Same concept as Corner Bakery.  I had the Mongolian Beef on Fried Rice.  So good!  I remember there was a station next to the soda fountain that had all of the different sauces.  I really enjoyed it and thought it was a nice change from the choices in Chicago.,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Last night; I was craving Pei Wei so I definitely had to go get some. I invited a friend (who has never tried Pei Wei) and we went to this location for the first time. The drive was long but definitely worth it. We ordered the Teriyaki Crunch Rolls; Traditional Chicken Lettuce Wraps; I got the small Pei Wei Spicy chicken on fried rice; and my friend ordered the small Thai Dynamite chicken on fried rice.   As we were getting our drinks at the awesome soda machine with a variety of different  flavors; our sushi was already finished being made! I already knew the sushi was pretty good but my friend was blown away by how delicious he thought they were. Within a couple minutes our chicken lettuce wraps were brought to our table. The lettuce was fresh; the chicken was flavorful and tasty. The chicken lettuce wraps is one of my favorite dishes on the menu. After munching on our appetizers for a few minutes; the waitress brought our two entrees to our table. The Pei Wei chicken is my favorite entree on the menu; it has a unique flavor and they made it exactly how I wanted it. No carrots or snap peas but add tons of broccoli. Plus extra sauce on the side because I just enjoy the flavor of the Pei Wei Spicy. The fried rice was quite mouth-watering and I enjoyed it as well. We couldn't even finish half of our small portions of entrees so it was great to box up to-go and save for the next day to eat!   All in all; the staff were quite friendly; the entire restaurant was cleaned/organized and the food was great and has big portions for a low fair price. This is a location that will be visited often.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,"This is our go to place for family outings. All three of my kids enjoy the \Honey-Seared Chicken with Noodles\""; they love it! And that means that we get to enjoy our lunch/dinner when we eat there. My hubby usually orders the Kung-Pao Beef; which I prefer over the chicken; because the meat gets a caramelization that the chicken doesn't get. And me; I am usually the one that orders the \""new\"" dish that they are introducing; like las week was the \""Black Pepper Chicken\""; which with tender and crunchy asparagus; was a very yummy dish! And it never hurts if you get a BOGO coupon in your inbox every once in a while!!""",0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Pei Wei is one of my favorite restaurants.  They have a good selection of food and their prices are decent.  Their food is fresh and so far I've liked everything I've tried.  They have a great kids menu; too.  This location is clean and has quick service.  The staff are friendly; too.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Great food great service! The Kung Pao Chicken is outstanding i would recommend always getting the larger portion its just that good,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,"You know; this was one of my favorite Pei Wei experiences... they got the food out fast even though it was lunch time and they were pretty busy. The service was also great on top of that. The lady we ordered from even gave us the \To Go\"" cups rather than the hard plastic ones; which I always have to request at other locations. She did it before I even had a chance to ask! She said that she was psychic ;)  Their iced tea was delicious; as usual. The food was also great; but no better or worse than other locations. I really don't like to review chain restaurants like this; but this particular location stood out a bit from the rest.""",1

zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,"Always fast friendly; service. I love the new sushi rolls; I've only tried the Wasabi Crunch Rolls because I love the \crunch\"" with the spicy tuna. The food always tastes fresh. Though the pork roll was flavorful; it was dropping in grease. I wouldn't recommend if that's the way they serve them all the time.""",1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Yes yes; it's a chain; but it's pretty darn good. They have consistently good service here on Dysart; and the place is always immaculate. There is this young; dark haired front register kid who works there frequently. Give him a raise! He knows all about the menu; always smiles; and has a great attitude! I actually am starting to prefer the food at Pei Wei to their grand daddy; PF Changs. If Pei Wei added some egg drop soup to their menu; I'd never look back.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,"Either comparing to other PW's or to other Asian diners; this one is A-OK.  Their food to me is on the salty or too spicy side.  We usually come here when the husband has a hankering for \Chinese food\"" but doesn't want \""authentic\"" Chinese food.  I can deal.  The parking kind of sucks here though so try to avoid coming during peak hours.  I've had pretty consistent decent service though whether it be dine in or take out.""",1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,The staff was awful and you could tell none of them wanted to be there. They also managed to screw up 3 of the 4 things we ordered and made the 4th so bad; we had to send it back. The food was fresh but couldn't wait to leave and never come back. The Pad Thai was awful; mushy and greasy with no flavor. The spicy tuna roll was actually a regular tuna roll with a blob of disgusting spicy mayo next to it on the plate.,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,always get great service and the food is always great....my FAVORITE asian place ever!  friendly service...most of the time very fast.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,I have tried different locations of Pei Wei; but I will just rate the Avondale one because that is the one I go to more often. It is OK; service is good. The favor of the food is either sweet; hot; or salty. I can not taste the different between Chinese; Japanese; Korean; Thai; and Vietnamese cuisines. I know it is a chain; but maybe I am spoiled with all the different cuisines around the valley. We go because my husband likes it.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Ordered shrimp lo mean to go...got all the way home; opened it up; stirred it in alittle....and THERE WAS A LIVE SPIDER IN IT. I took it all the way back; got a refund and a new dish; and they didn't even make it right the second time. I got plain noodles with a few pieces of shrimp in it. Needless to say; this regular customer WILL NOT be back... EVER. I am thoroughly disgusted and mad.,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,I visit this Pei Wei about once every couple of months and always have the honey seared chicken and crispy  potstickers ( I get the kids meal; its the perfect size). There have been a couple of times that the rice has been barely warm and my order has been messed up a couple of times. the staff has always been friendly and correct the problem.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,I like Pei Wei as I always know what to expect. However; this is the second time that I have placed a to go order and waited double the time I was told over the phone. This time I was told the order would take 15 minutes over the phone and I waited over 30 minutes. I would have received the food faster had I dined in. I saw multiple people arrive after me after who dined in. They were eating or leaving as I was barely getting my to go order. I had a simple order of fried rice; chicken Pei Wei; and California rolls.  I'm appalled!!! I didn't even receive an apology. When I asked why I waited so long I was told a cook was missing. If that were the case then those who arrived after me that dined in should still be waiting and not leaving; as I barely received my food!!!!,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,This would be a daily stop for us! Pei Wei Spicy Stock Velvet and Brown Rice. Very good for us. And now that we are down in weight; we share a dinner portion and are stuffed. Makes lunch very affordable at 20 bucks for three people.  On a sad note; we pulled a bag wrapper out of our meal a few weeks ago. :(  Update: Will note that today's water cup was full of something unpleasant that dried to the side; thank God I looked before I drank it. Plus our sons order was incorrect and we where charged for an adult meal instead of a kids. No mention of refund and late getting to an appointment; so we could do nothing about it. That's two strikes. One more and we won't be back to this location.,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,I find they offer solid Asian cuisine at a reasonable price.  I love the fact that I can place the order over the phone and then pick it up when it's ready.  I usually get the Chicken Lo Mein along with Lettuce Wraps or their Crab Wantons.  It's like a fast food version of PF Changs.  If you are in the mood for Chinese food; you could do significantly worse than stopping at Pei Wei.,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,We've heard of Pei Wei; but had not tried it in Los Angeles. What a lovely treat.  Friends directed us to the restaurant on Dysart. Very easy to find at the corner of a strip mall. Limited parking. The shops that surround the Avondale location are very busy.   Anyway; we found a spot; and proceeded into a world of soft lighting. The dining area is composed of dark wood and black leather booths. Sleek. Clean. Minimalist artwork.   Following the signs we ordered our meal; then self seated. Collected silverware and condiments along the back wall. Waited for our food to be delivered to our table.  We started with crab filled won tons nestled in a garlic; ginger; red pepper sauce. Luscious.  Followed by two pork-filled egg rolls with a delicate mustard dipping sauce. Yum.  Two entrees: (1) Chicken sauteed in teriyaki sauce with spinach greens; carrots; cabbage and onions; (2) Beef and broccoli tossed with Mongolian garlic sauce. Both meat dishes served over a bed of white rice. Tasty. Beautiful array of colors and textures.  We ordered way too much food for two people. We could have shared one entree and appetizers.  My only minor complaint . . . too much sauce over powers the flavorful meat and veggies. Next time I'll ask for sauce on the side.  Otherwise what a delightful surprise to find a bit of Asia in Arizona.,0
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Pretty good place over all. I like the food it is great and the service is ok too. I would go back anytime I had the urge for some good Asian infusion.,1
zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Not bad Pei Wei!.. I ordered the Japanese Teriyaki Bowl with fried rice and It was good; I also added some of the chilli paste that Pei Wei has and it just made it that much better. I have not tried any other dishes here; but I can honestly say i enjoyed my meal here.,0
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Another busy In-N-Out; but with fairly speedy service and consistent food. Our orders came out exactly as described. One minor detail was that the burgers were stacked vertically in our to-go bag; which made the condiments slide to the bottom of the burger when we came home and were ready to eat our tasty; yet as a result; messy lunch.,1

4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,They completely botched my drive-thru order tonight. Either that; or I ended up with someone else's order. Yes; I admit I should have checked inside the bag before I drove off and made it all the way home. But I also think it's reasonable that they double check their orders before handing them over. The cashier even read back my exact order to me as soon as I pulled up to the pick-up window. Of course; it's In-N-Out so what I did receive was still pretty good; but just not what I ordered. I'll be avoiding this particular location from now on.,0
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Best burgers ever. Hands down....The food; service; and quality are always consistent and amazingly great. You could eat off the floor of the restaurants if you wanted to.,1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,I love In-n-Out.  The service is always; always excellent.  Cheerful; prompt; courteous.  The employee training program is to be commended.  The simple menu means that you get your food quickly.  It is always fresh; always delicious.  I will always return!,1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,My boyfriend and I pulled up late on a busy Saturday night. The line was long both in store and at the drive thru so we decided to wait in the drive thru line. A young man named Thomas was standing in the line of cars taking orders on an iPad type thing. He was polite and professional and was moving the cars through very quickly. Samuel was also a rockstar at the first window. The moral of the story is that Thomas was cool and got our order right and we were pleasantly surprised!,1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,-The BEST fries in the whole wide world!! Cheap too!  -I LOVE these hamburgers; it's worth waiting for! I envision the toasty buns; secret sauce; and greasy goodness as I slowly wait my turn in line.  -Good location; right off the freeway.  -Service was friendly; just like any location.  -I learned there's a Jersey Mike's in the same parking lot; as I waited in the Drive-Thru line.  -I found this location with YELP's help.,1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,awesome burgers! the service is always super friendly! avoid the drive thru its more like a parking lot.,1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Service was MUCH faster than the last time I was here a few years prior.  I love the burgers; so yummy I could eat 3.  Lunchtime is a little too busy for me; the lines are too long so I'd avoid it between 11:30-1:00pm.,0
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,"In-n-Out was introduced to me by some SoCal fanatics - who \schooled me\"" to order from the \""secret menu\"" (available on their website) like a pro. So a 3x3 was my first experience. I've since decided a double-double is the right size for me.  The food here is the freshest fast food burger shop faire you'll get. The staff (yes; youngsters) is always extremely cheerful; friendly and patient.  If you need a burger and like the thin cut style fries; this beats the heck out of the golden arches less than a block away (or other national chains).""",1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Awesome burger today! Ordered the double double; ... The veggies were cold and fresh; the burger was done to perfection; the bun was perfectly toasted! And as always a super friendly staff. I will always give in and out two thumbs up. Much better than any other burger rival! These places need to speak like wildfire! Rather eat there than any other fast food joint!,1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Prob one of the best of the fast food type burger places but way overrated. They definitely have a cult following.  I have to say the burger is really good especially as animal style (one of the not so secret menu options). It is so small though you have to get at least a double or even a triple to be satisfied (3x3 good option). So once you have ordered a 3x3; animal style you got a nice sized burger that has all the right cheese gooeyness; grilled onion and sauce to boot. (prob is it hikes up the price).  I have to say the fries just suck (these are fighting words to the in-n-out lovers). They are cut fresh but they don't cook them right. They are soggy little suckers so i have to say Fry well (or well done) to get them in some sort of crispiness but then they are almost cooked to much. So i usually don't order anymore. They need to learn how to do the twice cook method (blanch then crisp)  Shakes are ok but nothing special what so ever. I do like how they have little hot yellow chiles if you want them.,0
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,"When I crave a good old fashioned burger; this is where I go.  They stick to what they know; and that's a great thing.  Simplicity is a virtue lost in the burger world.

4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Their burgers are fantastic; and the service is wonderful.  It's an unusual combination making the service staff suspect.  I'm not sure what makes them so cheery; and I suspect there's something going on....  They are always smiley; helpful; and bubbly; regardless of how late it is.  I suspect this behavior is insincere.  The Chandler location is open super-late; although they don't take care of the 24-hour professions like firemen; policemen; or hospital staff; which would've easily given them 5 stars.,1
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,The drive through line at this location always takes forever.  However the food is worth it!!!  Can't go wrong with anything you order.,0
4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Wasn't as awesome as we had expected. Burgers were ok; not a lot of options for toppings. Staff were friendly and service was fairly quick considering the line.,1

They do have a secret menu (http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp) which you should check out.  I get animal style on my burger AND my fries.  Delicious.  Also; make sure you pick up a shirt while you're there; at $9.50 it's almost a steal!!,1

VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,I was actually a little let down after my first time of trying Jersey Mike's because I was expecting something amazing from all the positive things I have heard about it.   My opinion was that it was slightly better than Subway; but there are several other sandwich places I would rather go to. I ordered an Italian sandwich; and it was good but quite standard. I was not impressed with the prices and found them to be a little much; so its not likely that this place will be a regular stop for me.,0
VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,"Jersey Mike's is delicious.   That being said; a request for the staff: When someone orders something that is obviously a pain to make; or involves something extra; don't make comments about how much food it is OUT LOUD; and \how on earth could someone eat this much food?\"". Ever stop to think that the sandwich will last me a few days? Sheesh.""",0
VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,"Jersey mikes used to be one of my fav sub shops. The service has REALLY gone downhill. A year or so ago they had some of the best customer service.. They would greet you upon entering and small talk with you; not to mention they would make your subs in a TIMELY manner.   I went there on Saturday and there was a mom and son in line in front me me. Great i thought! I beat the rush! ... Or not.  The gal slicing the meats who is the first person to take your order; doesn't even register that there are people standing here waiting to order. She must have been doing an online order because she was just chopping those meats up without a care in the world.  Finally after literally 6 or 7 minutes; she looks up and says \I'll be right with you\"".. Well ok at least she acknowledged us!   It only got worse from there.. The guy putting the condiments on the sandwiches was one of the slowest workers I have ever witnessed. He just couldn't get it together and took a few minutes to put on a few condiments on each sandwich. The lady in front of me turned around and gave me a \""what the hell; this is taking so long\"" face.   There was now a line almost out the door and a few people left because it was taking so long.  By the time I got to the register it was about 20 minutes since I came in. 20!! That is ridiculous!  The subs are great I love the food.

They would greet you upon entering and small talk with you; not to mention they would make your subs in a TIMELY manner.   I went there on Saturday and there was a mom and son in line in front me me. Great i thought! I beat the rush! ... Or not.  The gal slicing the meats who is the first person to take your order; doesn't even register that there are people standing here waiting to order. She must have been doing an online order because she was just chopping those meats up without a care in the world.  Finally after literally 6 or 7 minutes; she looks up and says \I'll be right with you\"".. Well ok at least she acknowledged us!   It only got worse from there.. The guy putting the condiments on the sandwiches was one of the slowest workers I have ever witnessed. He just couldn't get it together and took a few minutes to put on a few condiments on each sandwich. The lady in front of me turned around and gave me a \""what the hell; this is taking so long\"" face.   There was now a line almost out the door and a few people left because it was taking so long.  By the time I got to the register it was about 20 minutes since I came in. 20!! That is ridiculous!  The subs are great I love the food. But for the quality of service and prices; I'll head to jimmy johns where I can be in and out freaky fast.""",0
VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,We love Jersey Mike's everyone is so nice and the food is delicious! We eat here a lot and have always had the best service. We've been at all different times of days and have had different people help us and each time they take great care of us.,1
VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,"My boss ordered a bunch of turkey subs; ham subs; and beef subs and I was addicted.  Took my boyfriend here (who was completely dedicated to ONLY getting his subs from Jimmy John's) and he is now converted!  He's always asking if we can go.  The staff here is really nice and welcoming.  They'll make you feel like you've been a regular for years as soon as you walk in the door.  Make sure no matter what; though...you always have to get your sub made \MIKE'S WAY\""!!!""",1
VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,We have been back about ten more times (I know I need to do checkins) and it is always great.  Best customer service; great sandwiches; I love Jersey Mike's!,1
VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,"I had a coupon for a free sub from this place (I know; AWESOME!); so stopped by to spend it up.   I was immediately greeted by the friendly and engaging guy behind the counter; who kept up a cheerful conversation with me throughout the preparation of my order. Didn't even bat an eye at the coupon. Love that!  The sub I ordered was the Turkey provolone. I had it \Mike's Way\""; and it tasted great. The meat is sliced when you order it. The bread was fresh; with a crispy exterior and a soft interior.   Friends who know me know that I refuse to eat at or even enter a Subway because I just can't handle how it smells in there. Completely opposite experience here.  Great food; excellent service; clean and convenient location. Yay!""",1

VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,I would have given this shop a 4 even 5 star review until Monday March 12; we went in a few minutes after 5 only 1 young man working up front; 2 in back.  The young man upfront was slicing lettuce and we had to wait until he was done; I noticed that while cutting up the lettuce and breaking it apart he had no gloves on thought that was odd as he had his hands in the lettuce almost like kneading bread.  We were finally able to place our order only to find out that they had no Roast Beef.  Needless to say due to the glove incident and no RB I plan not to go again.  We used to go every payday with anywhere from 3 to 6 people.  Tried to call customer relations but all you could do was leave a message and when I called back to see if I could actually speak to an individual everyone was at an offsite meeting.  Store manager seemed to be concerned about not having gloves on but really nothing more.,0
VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,"Okay; so it's a \chain restaurant;\"" but you'd never know it by the quality sandwiches and welcoming staff.   I always love walking in the door and being greeted by a laughing; singing; and altogether boisterously friendly crew.   The quality of the sandwiches is above any other \""chain\"" sub shop. All the meat and cheese is freshly cut when you order; the bread is always great; and the veggies are above par (i.e. no wilted tomatoes etc.).   Subway fans... Fear Mike!""",1
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Sonic in general serves up a pretty tasty diet cherry limeade and some indulgent milkshakes that allow you to mix several flavors in; such as strawberry chocolate or banana pineapple.  They have happy hour from 2-4 P.M. each day on their drinks (such as limeades) and slushes.  They have gotten rid of a lot of their chicken options though; which saddened me as I was a fan of their chicken club toaster.  This Sonic location might have some problems with their microphone at the drive through; because our orders seem to get confused more often than at other fast food places.,0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,They really need to get a better drive-through speaker.  I had to repeat my order 5 times after waiting several minutes to even get someone to take my order.  When I went to the window; my order was still wrong; which was then fixed.  I got home; to discover that even with the correction at the window; they gave me the wrong shake.  I've had problems ordering from this drive-through almost every single time I've been here; but this was the last straw.  Never planning on ordering from here again.,0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Went through the drive through for some breakfast. First thing I was greeted with was a very unfriendly staff; not even hello. The young lady never even smiled! Seems like she just hates her job; or me. Anyways; I ordered 2 breakfast burritos; one with no cheese. The speed of gettin the food was good and they got my order correct; which surprised me cause they have always gotten it wrong. The burritos Tasted ok; not highly recommended.,0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Really friendly and great food as always. However; they need a new speaker system in drive through because I always have to drive to window to order.,1
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,They never get my order wrong; although every once in a while they will put extra food I didn't ask for into my box :) Always love free stuff. Excellent chicken; coneys; slushes; and extra-thick malts just like I like 'em. What needs to be hot is hot; and what needs to be cold is cold. Fast service and they always double-check my order at the window. Very polite.,1

BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Went here today with a gift card. It wouldn't work in the card reader at the drive up spot; so I asked the server to help. I had just got the card so I knew there was money on it. They ended up having the manager come out; but no one could get it to work. They ended up paying for the whole meal; which I really appreciated because I really only dropped by because I had the card. Is this a 5 star resteraunt; no; but the service was outstanding and the food was good for being fast food. I really like their shakes (hoping the do 1/2 off shakes again this summer) & happy hour drinks (especially the strawberry limeade)!,1
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Me and my wife came when there was almost no one at this location. We ordered tots and medium hot fudge shakes. They brought us hot fudge sundaes. Then after we got our food they came back out and asked us to re-park our car in the empty parking lot because we pulled in backwards. We will not be returning to this poorly managed Sonic.,0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Volunteered for a local non-profit in this area years ago; and frequently stopped here on my way in . . . For drinks; that is!  When it comes to refreshing summer concoctions on the cheap; Sonic is hard to beat.   I love the Diet Cherry Limeades and the Lemon Berry Slush!   Not a fan of Sonic's grub; the mystery meat burgers are pretty sketch. But the Mozzarella Sticks aren't bad!    Everyone here was very friendly. Great service too.,1
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Love the food and drinks here and the staff is super friendly; but the drive-through wait can be REALLY slow. We've been going here regularly for about 10 months since we moved to the area and about 6 months ago; started noticing the long waits at the drive-through. We went a few weeks ago close to midnight and were told that their computers were acting up; so they were taking orders at the window. There was one car ahead of us at the window. Twenty-five minutes later and we were STILL waiting behind the other car. This is NOT fast food and all we wanted were a couple drinks. We ended up leaving and going somewhere else - haven't returned since. Really disappointing as we like this place for all other reasons.,0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,...bottom line; i hate this place. slimey brown lettuce; over riped and mashy tomatoes. they never get your order right; even the tots suck here. close this place down soon. i'm never going back,0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,"Wow.... where do I start?  Well about a week ago I ordered a burger and a side; I received the wrong burger and the wrong side; but I had already rode my bike home. So I called the manager on duty; lets call him \T\"". He was SUPER kind and wrote me down for a comp the next time I came in which was tonight.  I came all the way from phoenix but wanted to claim my free meal on the way home so I stopped in. It took them 15 MIN to bring out my comp order; but it was wrong again because they didn't read the order back to me to verify (and they never have). So I told the carhop and it took another ten minutes to get the correct burger out to me. By this time; my side item was cold. I had every intention of tipping the carhop even though I was claiming a free order. But she was so distant and lacked people skills and didn't remember the things I requested and didn't look me in the eyes; plus my order was wrong a third time. By the time I rode home; my food was cold (I even had it in a warm environment for the whole journey) and there was little to no condiments on my burger! Who wants a dry burger? Not this guy. All I can say; is the night manager on duty every time I go there looks like a punk (hood always covering his face; and I sound old for saying that; but I'm a 25 year old punk rocker myself; haha) and the kitchen seems to be stoned because I witnessed 3 inaccurate orders while I was trying to claim mine.  My main complaint is that I worked at Sonic for over 2 years; and this kind of behavior at my locations would've gotten me fired. I've returned to the restaurant business since then and my philosophy is STILL to treat the customer how you would like to be treated. What's so hard about that?! Yeah; it's fast food. Yeah; they get paid minimum wage. But if you cant even follow your recipes; common sense; and core values; you don't deserve to have the job. There's many people out of work who would kill to have a job; even at Sonic. It's sad because this location is RIGHT by my house and it's good for a quick; cheap meal; but I will not be returning. This is absolutely the WORST Sonic experience I've ever had and it's the worst Sonic I've been to. What a shame; too; because it's in such a nice area. Maybe it's just the night crew since that's the time I usually visit; but all I know is this location needs a revamping of values and employees.""",0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers; they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place.,0
BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,I love Sonic's amazing selection of drinks; slushes; shakes; malts; and pretty much and variation of beverage.  Usually the speedy service is also a plus when it comes to picking up some quality fast food.  However; I was there the other night and chose the drive-thru (versus parking and ordering); and wound up sitting in line for over ten minutes before I opted to get out of line and just park.  Two different cars ahead of me either had massive orders; indecisive drivers; or incompetent order-takers.  It could have been all three; but it was the longest wait I've ever experience; with no one attempting to move it along any quicker.  I will note; however; that the strawberry slush I eventually brought home was refreshing and amazing.,0

BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,"Ordered a strawberry slush; watermelon slush; cherry slush; and coke slush. Sounds fairly simple; right? Instead; they forgot the watermelon slush and brought out a piña colada slush instead of the coke slush. The girl at the drive-thru was rude when we pointed out the obvious mistake with the piña colada slush and claimed my white colored slush was \definitely\"" coke. I don't think so. We pulled ahead to wait for the watermelon slush and received a cherry slush. Ugh. When I asked to have my coke slush corrected; the car hop ignored me and hurried away. What kind of customer service is this? Won't be going there again.""",0

BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,My fiance and I arrived roughly around 1020 and ended up leaving at 1105 without our order. No one bothered to check up on us and I was too pissed off after waiting more than 40 minutes to even dare ask. The car that arrived at 1055 got their order within 10 minutes and that's what pissed us off the most.  I have a feeling the kid never registered our order to begin with as it doesn't take 40 minutes to at least make a shake.,0
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,Don't let the long lines discourage you from coming to Chipotle. The staff works fast and the food is plentiful and served at the right temperature. The staff is also nice and you don't have to repeat yourself when placing your order.   On this particular day; I had chicken tacos. They were absolutely yum. Everything is made to your specifications so if something isn't right; it's probably your fault! :) My husband loves the burritos. Now while the girl making his over did it with the salsa; it was still pretty darn yum...and why was it yum? Because it was made the way he likes it. :)   The one thing I like a lot at Chipotle is the guacamole. It is so flavorful and I love chunky guacamole. They do it just right here at Chipotle.,1
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,Out of all the Chipotles in the city; this one is by far one that is operated the worst.  Portions are weak;  they need to work on thier cleanliness. Service is subpar. You do not get your monies worth from this location.  I think it needs an overhaul with better management. hours are horrible;  they close at 10 yet the line was out the door till 1030. They need to revamp thier customer service. Maybe I should have just settled for a burger tonight.,0
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,Visit Chipotle quite often at Shea and 92nd St area in Scottsdale; but I was in Peoria for business.  Stopped in and wow; customer service skills could use some work.  Everyone behind the counter was more interested in talking to a customer who obviously was a friend of someone; past worker; or something.  Talking about subjects that should not be spoken about out loud with customers around.  Had to repeat my order; sloppy in building my burrito bowl to go; and couldn't even pay attention in placing the lid on which came off inside the bag.,0

Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,Food was good and fresh. Service was fast. Dining area was clean.,1
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,"let me make this clear:  this review is for THIS Chipotle and this Chipotle ONLY!  i've never had what i consider a friendly experience here.  (mental note: the one on 59th and thunderbird is closer.  i need to go there next time)  the last time i went in; it was on the heels of a great experience at another location (if i have time it'll be right above this one).  first of all; there was  a pretty long line considering that it wasn't really busy.  i considered the possiblity that there could be ONE customer  up there that wasn't sure what they wanted or something along those lines; but as the line crept along i realized that it wasn't a customer; but indeed the staff behind the counter.  when i ordered my vegetarian burrito; the burrito maker didn't seem to know  what went in it.  come on guys; you have a VERY basic; very SIMPLE menu.  the veggie burrito gets by default: onion and pepper mix; BLACK BEANS (unlike the other burritos where you get a choice -- of course you CAN substitute the pinto beans; but if you don't specify you get the black).  he points to the pepper and onion mix and asks if that's what i want. \yes\"".  then he put the rice in.  no beans until i reminded him.  i realize we all have our off days; but there was just a bunch of stuff off here.  no one was smiling or friendly and the burritos seemed a little smaller than what i'm used  to at a Chipotle.  If i'd never been to one before; i'd probably just suck it up and enjoy my delish food; but i KNOW this isn't the standard and was really disappointed.  from now on i MUST remember that there is another one in my vicinity and go there instead.""",0
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,I go to this location about 3-4 times a week since I work and gym nearby and every time the staff is nice and the food is fresh! During lunch time the lines are all the way to the door but the staff work fast and efficiently and its never a long wait!   I always order the same thing and never get sick of it.   Bowl: 3 scoops brown rice; fajita; chicken; mild/med/corn; sour cream; cheese; and lots of lettuce.,0
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,We came here today after a long day at the park.  There was a long line but the staff was very fast.  I ordered the chicken burrito with black beans; rice; sour cream and I had them add grilled veggies and extra hot sauce. The burrito was hot; huge and delicious.  The only negative was that the last several bites were all rice.   Great healthy meal to soak up the beer though.,0
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,Went in for take out.  Huge line due to fundraiser.   $30 worth of food for 4 people.  Paid with my credit card and our food was all bagged up.  We left and drove home.  My son's order was missing the main item (quesadilla).   I called and after waiting several minutes to speak to the manager; she said she knew about the missing item and said I could drive back to the store for a $4.00 refund.   I asked that they credit my card back over the phone.  Manager got snippy and insisted there was no way to do that except in the store.  I ask for Division Manager name.  Again several minutes later I finally get the info.   Left him a voice mail.   No return call yet several hours later.   Make sure you check your order because their service is terrible.   Inconvenienced twice in one visit.   I will be recommending our school no longer brings fund raisers to this location.  Update:  5 days later and no call back from the Division Manager.   Guess they don't need the business.  Please avoid this restaurant - they have proven they don't care about their own mistakes or how badly they treat their customers.,0

Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,Love the food.  Always clean and for the most part has friendly service. The music is strangely weird at times and much too loud.,1
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,I still haven't fully decided where my heart lies with Chipotle.   Half of the time when I come here; I get great food! The other half of the time; it sucks. I usually get weird pieces of chicken in my salads; or burritos (depending on my order). Once it almost even made me consider reinstating my vegetarianism.  Honestly; though; the last few times I have been here they have done an exceptional job. I will have to update later.,0
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,So say can I say about this Chipotle...  the food is always good;  fast and courteous service; and they keep the place very clean.  As clean as you can make it when it is always busy.  Try the Sofritas.  They are my favorite!,1
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,About a year ago i used to dread coming here only because of the long lines and incompetent  employees;but have always liked the food so i chose to endure it.But my last few visits have been much better.They hired a bunch of new people who are fast and friendly.no more are the days of waiting in line for 20 minutes while the employees slowly prepare each meal;while dilly dallying.The food is always good;and the portions are huge!My only complaint is;if you go in after 9;they're usually low on meat so you end up with less than you'd normally get if it was earlier. they should really have enough prepared for the later crowd because there's always people in there after 9.Other than that;i have nothing bad to say.I am very pleased that they have stepped up thier game when it comes to service.Keep up the good work guys.,1
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,"I love Chipotle and have been coming to this location since it opened.  But from here on out; I think I'll pass.    The two times that I have ordered online (only 2 weeks apart); I am left waiting because the employees forget to check the online orders.  That is; I show up at the time that I am told the food will be ready; only to find that they haven't even looked at my order.  To make matters worse; both times they failed to push my order to the front of the line; so I've been left waiting a while... Neither times have I been offered anything other than a \we're sorry\""; talk is cheap.  The other night that this happened to me; they actually had a guy in line who had an order for 2; but his card kept declining (and he apparently had no other cards).  So the manager tells him; that the meal is on the house... now admittedly that is a very nice gesture... but they probably should have offered me something to make up for their screw up (twice)... nope.  I won't be back.""",0
Evi6u84U3F6VhgriCDhQUg,This review like the others is only for this particular chipolte.   I live down the street so i sometimes stop in grab a fajita burrito. It's simply AMAZING!  Only down side is the foot traffic. Its really busy because it's in the arrowhead area. So many eff'ing people especially around lunch and dinner. So many that i stopped coming for a long time.  UNTIL i found the chipotle app for my iPhone and iPad. I guess you can order online via their website too. But now i can just order AND pay on my phone. Walk straight in; bypass the line. (which i really enjoy because people in that long line look at u like ur crazy for cutting in line ha ha) then grab my food and leave. It's awesome.   So anyway i recommend this place.  Plus it's healthy compared to the crappy fast-food industry.,0
JHUcIssf3crggsVxfQ8q8w,The chicken is fantastic; the potatoes are amazing; and the service is prompt. I would recommend anything on the menu. This food doesn't even compare to other fried chicken joints.,1
JHUcIssf3crggsVxfQ8q8w,Popeye's is not just for breast men or leg men or even your every day garden variety wing man. They cater to the thigh lovers out there. I ordered a 3 piece thigh combo meal with red beans and rice along with a large drink for $7.64. The meal includes one of those delicious buttery biscuits. The chicken and the red beans and rice hit the spot.  The a/c at the place is also just at the right temperature on one of those 112 degree days. I'm definitely including Popeye's in the summer lunch rotation.,0
JHUcIssf3crggsVxfQ8q8w,For a fast food joint; this is stellar! The food is great; the prices are great and the service has always been Great!!!  I reccomend the spicy fried chicken; mashed potatoes and a biscuit with honey on it. YUMMMMM!!!!  I have traveled the world and found this place in New Orleans Louisiana about 20 years ago. I loved it every since! Thank goodness they brought it to Arizona!  My 8 year old wanted me to take a picture of the sink in the bathroom and post a bad review on it because it has those knobs you have to hold down in order to get the water to come out; lol...I said NO; I love this place and we won't do that to them!  To the Owner: Don't change a thing; except your faucet in the bathroom sink!,0

JHUcIssf3crggsVxfQ8q8w,"I hesitated to write this. I mean; everyone has a bad day; but in the end; my disgust and frustration won out. On 3/2 my son and I dined at this location. The young man at the counter - Alex - was super nice and friendly. Unfortunately; the rest of our visit was less than stellar. About half way through our meal; three kids (around age 11 or so) came in a got water cups from someone behind the counter. These kids spend over 10 minutes at the soda machine tasting every possible concoction of soft drink; rinsing their cups under the fountain; then wiping them out with napkins they left on the counter. I finally got up to say something to \Tom\"" the manager when one of the boy started washing under the water dispenser. Despite the boys being there over 10 minutes at this point; he claim he hadn't seen anything. His response to my complaint and concern - 1) \""No kids come behind the counter so it's ok.\"" 2) \""I'm not their parents. We'll clean it up later.\""   To Tom (and Popeye's) I say this - No; you are not therr parents. What you are is a manager our a facility that serves food to the public. You have a duty with that job to make sure the place is kept as clean as possible which includes asking people to leave if needed.  Our bill was just over $20. These 3 kids spend $0. Hope they come back with their parents to eat; because you won't be getting our business again. I have also filed a complaint with the Maricopa County Department of Environmental Services;""",1
JHUcIssf3crggsVxfQ8q8w,I love Popeyes; and I est a dofferent location quite frequently.  My wife and I had an urge and this one is close; so we went.  The food is normal Popeyes good; we had the 3 piece chicken strips; but there were a couple of differences from the others.  First it is SLOW.  From order to food was 20 minutes. Second; the portions in this place were a lot smaller than other locations; usually we get the 2 piece and are stuffed when we leave.  Here we got the 3 piece and were still hungry.  So if we want Popeyes and don't want to drive; we will go here.  Otherwise; we'll go to one of the others.,0
JHUcIssf3crggsVxfQ8q8w,"Admittedly; I like Popeyes! And yes; I am a Fan!  Whether its this one; or the one in Blythe coming back from California; it's a real treat to pick up some NOLA inspired food.  Their Cajun Gravy is to die for! Really.  Stopped in today to catch up with Scott D. We have been checking into businesses on Yelp together for over four years. Long time! It's been a fun four years and nice to kick back with a friend who also loves Popeyes!  I had a Po'Boy Chicken sandwich; which wasn't bad.  But I wouldn't insult any of my NOLA friends by calling it a true Po'Boy.  I also ordered three chicken strips and asked for a Cajun Gravy chaser.  LOL  It ran me just under $8.00; not a steal but a fair price. A better deal is what Scott ordered; their Tuesday Special of 2 pieces of chicken; biscuit and Pop for $2.99.  \Love that Chicken at Popeyes!\""  Enjoy""",0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Have been to this location a couple of times. The staff is always relatively friendly and gets the orders fast. I like how they cut the meat right in front of you. This time I got the Italian sub mikes way. It tasted awesome! There bread is fresh and fluffy. Try also have a student discount and you get chips and a drink for a total of about $7.55. Great deal! I have seen people complain about ants in the soda machine; but I didn't get any in my Mountain Dew. Over all this place is great; clean; delicious and I highly recommend.,1
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Came here tonight and ordered the Super Sub. So delicious. I am kind of biased towards Jimmy Johns subs; but this company loads on a lot more meat on the sandwiches; and they have a larger meat selection.   They offer a great student discount which includes chips and a drink. I read previous reviews about ants in the soda machine so I was extremely cautious. Inspected the soda; and it was ant free. Yay.   Will definitely be coming back.,0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Awsome!! Good service;  average price; but very clean!! No lard in stuff unlike the Mexican restaurant next door! !,1
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,"Nothing great about this place. They could replace the sign with Subway and I would never know...except that there would be fewer options to top my sub with. They coined the phrase \Mike's Way\"" in an effort to allow you to order your sandwich in some special and tasty way. In reality; it means lettuce; tomatoes; oil and vinegar...wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. As a vegetarian; this is one of my least favorite sub places since there are not too many toppings for those of us avoiding the meat selections.  I've only been here once and will not be going back.""",0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,"Whoever likes subway may not like this place. Jersey mike's cut; cooks; & prepare to order; no chilled meat bins here. The sandwiches has the right amount of everything. No one condiment or topping will over power you sandwich of choice. I always recommend getting the sandwiches done \Mike's way\"". It's tomatoes; lettuce; red wine vinegar; olive oil; herbs and salt&pepper. You don't really need more than that.""",0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,"I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ.  I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close.    I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But; if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The \Mike's Way\"" option (lettuce; onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland; I love to add the mustard; mayo & pepperocini.  Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.    Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long; but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.  I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.  And; I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.  They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful; helpful people.  Not a necessity for a sandwich; but certainly a lot better than the opposite.""",1

vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Jersey Mike's is a Franchise based out of Point Pleasant; New Jersey that just opened in Tempe. I grew up eating at Mike's every summer when my family would go to the Jersey Shore for the month of August. Let me tell you this is the quintessential sub!   The meat is finely sliced right when you order it; and piled high. The vegetables; lettuce; tomato & onions are fresh. That's right there isn't a billion ingredients to muck up the taste! The oil & red wine vinegar mix is AMAZING! With the special blend of spices they add to it...OH MY GOD so good! The bread is just perfect! Baked fresh daily this bread is soft; and absorbs the juices perfectly.  Once again this is the perfect sub. I am so glad they are now open in Arizona. If you are not sure what to get try the #13 The Original Italian; it is the best tasting in the bunch!,0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,"I've always liked Jersey Mike's. There is something about a \wet\"" sub that intrigues me. Whenever I go I get it Mike's Way.  The service is really good too. I like that they slice the meat and cheese there (even if the turkey doesn't naturally come in a log shape) as it makes me feel like it is just a little fresher than the other guys.  Definitely give it a go.""",1
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I have been to many a sub shop in many a place and consider myself pretty well versed when it comes to meat; cheese; and bread. This place is a joke. My parents hyped it up saying it was so great and my experience was horrible. Even if I actually lived in the area and it was convenient to go back I would not. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. (Yeah yeah I know... I ordered a wrap at a sub shop... give me a break!) First of all; the description says; 'sliced chicken' so I think; okay great; cool; they have deli style chicken not just a chopped up chicken breast! WRONG. My wrap came with chopped chicken... while I watched them make what was soon to be a very disappointing meal I noticed that they put three slices of cheese on the meat while it was on the grill. Where the cheese went when they transferred it from the grill to my wrap I don't know because I was only able to find one gob of it inside the tortilla once I got my hands on it. Along with the MIA cheese; so too followed the buffalo sauce. How you make a buffalo chicken wrap without buffalo sauce is beyond me; I'm still scratching my head. What was the cherry on the sundae for me was the fact that I didn't realize this before we got all the way back to the house; at which point lost the will to do anything about this pathetic thing that I was charged $7 for. Our total came to around $15 with tax of course; but that was for my wrap and my boyfriend's sandwich. No drink. No chips. No sides. RIDICULOUS. Take my advice and go to Charley's; wouldn't get too attached to a place I don't think will be in business very long. The workers are too busy chatting to get your order right.,0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,"I've been to this location a few times as this is my \go-to-spot\"" while waiting to meet people from Craigslist to buy or sell something from people around Tempe.    I love the way they slice all the ingredients; the meats and the cheese right on the spot according to the sandwich you order.    They also hot sandwiches here and they don't nuke them in microwaves like they do at subway.  They have a grill!  Jersey Mike's is no-brainer over Subway any day!""",0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Just like the rating says on here; they are A-OK. After my second visit here; I am confident enough to say that they are quite simply a traditional sub shop; like subway used to be before Jared waded over and lost all the weight. Lets discuss the pros and cons of Jersey Mikes - Tempe.  ~Fud/Drink~ Jersey Mikes; first off; has solid; traditional; sub options. If you want a simple Italian sub with extra olive oil; and tasty Italian meats; come here and munch down. If you want a foofie Hawaiian pineapple open faced mozzarella sub (just made that up; it sounds good) then go elsewhere. Their food options are pretty simple; but the meats help make each sub. Overall; they offer just a a couple of add-in options to your sub and they aren't high quality; especially the lettuce and tomatoes.  The tomatoes are pretty slimy; not super-fresh and the lettuce seems to be of the bagged variety. The bread is average as well; nothing amazing to write home about. The onions actually looked nice; they were presented in their dish all pre-strung; rather than chopped up. They were also white onions; not the traditional red; which I actually enjoyed better on the sub. But once again; the meats...they are great. Overall; its a shame they don't put more stock in everything besides the meat; because they did a good job there. They have no beers by the way; a soda fountain with regular options will do just fine. If you need a beer; Wingstop next store has a number of beers on stock.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The service here is near-perfect. They are fast; friendly and intelligently listen to your order. The sub came down the assembly line and was in the hands of the toppings-adder (what is the title of this person anyway?) quickly. I did take issue with the fact that the pieces of cheese they added on the sub were about as thin as I get at the deli at a supermarket; super-thin; that is. Normally you expect a couple semi-thick slices of cheese; but the provolone slivers they gave me were so small I could barely taste that flavor. After accepting my request for extra lettuce and tomatoes I went and asked for some sides in cups which he dished for me in fast order as well. There is no true ambiance to the place; they have a simple set up with chairs and tables; music isn't a priority. Its a sub-shop guys.  ~Extras/Rating!~ They taste MUCH better than the generic Subway. Please just discard Subway and eat at a real sub shop like this one. You get so much more when you eat a spot like this. I do hope JM's takes a look into better quality minus the meat.  They do a real good job at customer service and the management knows how to train their employees well. The subs hold up well against other competitors. However I feel as though I am paying more than necessary for a sandwich that is pretty average besides the items I already laid out for you.  I wish they would let us do take home service of their meats; that would be great. This place is deserving of better than 3 stars; maybe 3 1/2...But we don't have that option; do we ;-) ? Would I come back? YES! I have tried two completely different items; and it seems Italian is the best route. I am not an Italian sub guy per-say; but this is a tasty treat if I am in that mood. Try your best to make your first sub an Italian one; and ENJOY!,1

vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I will agree with the overpriced issue with Jersey Mike's.  Besides that...this is the best damn Philly Cheese Steak I have had in Arizona.  (I am not from Philly; so I admit I am not a pro at the Cheese Steak cuisine)  Everything there is fresh; from the bread to the veggies to the meat.  My sandwich is never a mess..which is amazing in itself. Service is great; even for ASU students working there.  Great location....Really can't say anything bad about the place...it just sucks when there is construction on Scottsdale road and it makes it almost impossible to get there.  (One day it was so bad; I had to settle for Rubios....not a good settle when all you want is a cheese steak.),0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,"That was the worst sub I have ever had in my life (Chicken Parm).  The chicken was rubbery and the bread was mushy as all hell. BUT; my boyfriend's turkey sub looked really good and he confirmed that! It's my own fault for getting a hot sub at a \Subway\"" type place..plain and simple.  The place was clean and I like that they slice the meat for subs to order.  Maybe I'll try something else if I decide to go back.""",0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Wow I love the sandwiches here.  I just got the turkey hoagie and it was delicious!  Definitely felt like the east coast. :)  It's neat that the meats are in a deli counter and are sliced fresh to order.  I also just noticed a yelp review that you can get a free sandwich on your birthday.  Free stuff is always a plus!,0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I came here completely on accident. I  wanted a sub; and as usual; Port of Subs was closed on a Sunday.  (dam you port of subs!)  I was driving around trying to find something to eat; and I came across this place I have never tried before.  Its right off the 202 and Rural Road.  Went inside and reviewed the menu; and thought I would place an order.  The menu has a reasonable selection; but its not huge.  Some wraps; subs; and thats about it.  I ended up ordering the turkey and roast beef sub.  I asked about the sizes; and thier sizing chart is so odd! Its like 5 inches; 8 inches or 15 inches.  weird.  I went for the 8 inch roast beef and turkey sub.  I really liked the sub.  It was tasty!  YUM on the bread!  I found it to be flavorful and delicous!!!  But; I found this place to be EXPENSIVE!  WTF $10.35 for the 15 inch sub; before tax?  seriously?  I dropped a few bucks on my 8 inch sub; but I guess the prices were higher then I would have liked to see.   I agree with Andrea that I think this place is a little overpriced.  I will say; the service was wonderful when i was there...but slow.  Even though the staff was extra nice and extremely helpful; I felt like I was watching my sub being made in slow motion.  I would eat here again; easily.,1

vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Visited this location last night with my 10 year old. We had never been in a Jersey Mike's so we were up to try it. The subs were ok; nothing to write home about. The bigger issue was the soda machine and customer service. When my daughter went to fill her soda; she chose Sprite/Sierra Mist; the cup was filled with a clear liquid AND hundreds of ants! We took the cup to the cash register where we stood for over 7 minutes because the associates were in the back. Once the young man came out we showed him what was in the cup and he was also grossed out. He stated he would go clean the soda machine. Never once did we see anyone go clean the machine. We opted for a bottled drink instead. We ate our food and watched 4 other customers fill up their drinks from the ant infested soda machine. They all got dark sodas so I am sure they did not see the ants and continued drinking. This is a problem Jersey Mike's! Gross and I will never go back to one of your establishments.,0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I had heard great things about this sub shop; but honestly Mr. Goodcents subs are far better. The problem is the bread. It was hard; crumbly; not flavorable. The tomatoes were slimmy and on verge of rotten. I was also disappointed only Pepsi products and NO DR PEPPER on the fountain. On the plus side the turkey was high quality and sliced to order.,0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Jersey Mikes has GREAT subs but still isn't a replacement for Subway.   While I love their turkey sub; they don't have a very wide variety of sandwich toppings and I don't like their tuna. (I need black olives and spinach! Maybe I'm just spoiled.)  I'll come here for a turkey sub but if I feel like tuna I'll stick to subway.  When I came with my cousin she ordered a sub with nothing but mayo and lettuce on it and after some laughter the guy behind the counter refused to let her pay for such a measly sandwich. When she ordered the same thing at Subway they charged her for a veggie anyways. It was pretty cool of him.,0
vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,It wasn't as busy and the service was good; I got the club sub; but just wasn't feeling the sub. I just thought it was ok. Nothing good or bad; just right there with mediocre.,1

Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,How can you go wrong with Chipotle?! I've always enjoyed this place and their fast; quick service. I use the Chipotle app during lunch hour to avoid the lines. Order on your app; choose to pay at the store and go straight to the register. However; sometimes I do visit this location spur of the moment. Not only is their staff fast and friendly but the food has always been excellent. I prefer the burrito bowls and tacos. I would consider Chipotle inexpensive but some may argue with me on that. However; I think you get what you pay for and at Chipotle they definitely serve some goodness! I always recommend Chipotle especially this location's service. Order all four salsas to give your burrito that extra kick!,1

Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,Chipotle the organization has developed a pretty good business model: Good food; made fresh in front of the customer; Fast-ish service that is usually well managed and friendly; and a website experience that allows you to order ahead of time and cut the line.  Additionally the fair is (seemingly) healthier than standard fast food and the decor is contemporary which is a refreshing change fron the obnoxious appearance of the average jack in the box or Subway.  However; I am giving this chipotle 3 stars; even though I eat here more often than I eat at any other restaurant.  The two reasons for the average rating are:  1. A homeless person has set up shop outside of the front door 2. As I have alluded; I use the online ordering feature; and they seem to meet the promised time only occasionally.   So- they need to shoo the bum and pay more attention to their online customers.  Then I will give this chipotle 5 stars,1

Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,The homeless guy is gone.  Also; there is at least one employee that recognizes me; and tonight she handed me my order as walked up to the counter.  That was fantastic.  However; they still have some room to improve.  Not all of the employees are as aware as the one I have mentioned; but I am a satisfied customer.,1
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,Honestly; I have had Chipotle approximatley 1;000 different times in the past 9 years since I first fell in love with it. This location is in the top 5% of best visits to the restaurant that I have had. Customer Service was top notch; food was perfectly cooked; chips done right (not too much salt; hint of lime); and the speed of the line was outstanding. Even with the Lady with two kids meals in front of me.,1
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,I find myself at this Chipotle more than I should. Idk what happens but somehow this place is dinner about twice a week. Having lived in the neighborhood for more than 4 years I have seen them change quite a bit over the years. The quality of the food is always good; however the attitude you will get from some of the employees can be a drag.  I did notice within the last year or so that the steak is mostly pink. I brought this up to them and they gave me the option to cook the steak a little more for me. I didn't realize that was an option but now that I know that's how I'll be placing my order!,0
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,I am super fan.  I have been hitting this place up for about two years...Yeah; I know I need to submit my reviews faster.  SMH.  Its terrible.  Sorry for the rant.  Every time I set foot in this building; I great customer service with quick; healthy food.  I have no compliments; just praise for this location.    Four thumbs up!!!!,1
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,This review is for online ordering/take out.  I had no idea you could do that!  A couple folks from work were ordering and asked if I wanted in. Um; yes please.  The website asked for names for each meal within the order; which we found out later was so they could write first names on similar dishes... so simple; but it made such a difference.  Parking was difficult and we lucked in to a decent spot. In the future I'd likely park near a different building and prepare for a short walk rather than fight in the small lot.  When we walked in; the place was packed to the gills!  It was such a relief to be able to walk up to the to-go window and wait in a line behind one person; rather than 20.  Our order was there and ready; warm; and 95% accurate (I got white rice instead of brown).    For being in the thick of the lunch rush; this location was handling things pretty well and it was running smoothly.  Still; I'm so excited about this new found order-ahead thing.  Rumor has it there's an app; too?,0
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,Ordering with the iPhone app probably bumps it up to 4 stars. I press 3 buttons. The food is paid for and waiting for me. Oh; & the best guac & chips. Ever.,0
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,What's not to love; fresh food; made to order; and organic and natural ingredients whenever possible.  This chipotle gets a huge line at 1155 due to the Univ of Phoenix lunch rush; but they generally move the line pretty quickly. There is one older woman on the line who can be a bit of a burrito-grouch (she once told me that i couldn't have a side of corn tortillas with my bowl....um no); but the rest of the staff is great.,1
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,I've given this place; not two; not three; but FOUR attempts to redeem themselves and yet they continue to fail me. They're a disgrace to the Chipotle family. I usually order in advance and pick up food for myself and several co-workers and these have been my experiences over the span of 7 months:  1st trip: I got 3 soft tacos with barbacoa: the meat was so greasy I managed to fill half a cup with grease.  2nd trip: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa: the meat looked and tasted as if someone had attempted to chew a fatty part of steak and then just put it back in my bowl.  3rd trip: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa; light sour cream; extra cheese and pico: received a bowl with so much sour cream; I couldn't see anything under it. Had about 3 strands of cheese on top.   last attempt; today: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa; light sour cream; extra cheese and pico: meat was dry and chewy; no pico; no sour cream; half a spoon of rice and beans and so much cheese it was almost inedible. (and if you've read my reviews; you know how much I LOVE cheese.)  In conclusion; I don't know how this Chipotle is still in business. It's lacks flavor; attention and effort. Will never return to this Chipotle and discourage others from attempting to eat here.,0
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,Cheers to this location!!! Excellent service and great portions!,1
Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,This Chipotle has surpassed my expectations in every area of customer service. This location can get a little hectic during the lunch rush which basically starts 10 minutes before they open. But instead of waiting until 11am they will actually open their doors early because of the line forming outside. And even when there is a long line of 20+ people; they can move the line in record time. A line all the way out the door will only take about 5-8 minutes. This has to be because they keep this location fully staffed especially when it gets crowded.  As for the food I have never had a problem with any visits at this location or any other locations.,1
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,Had the patty melt and a concrete here. The patty melt had a tiny amount of onions on it; with melted cheese on rye bread. I liked that the ground meat is cooked fresh as soon as you order it; but it wasn't as juicy as other burgers I've had at other places. The burger itself really needed the special sauce from the counter to give it more flavor.  The fries were thin cut; and just a tad over-salted.  The concrete was good; filled with thick frozen custard; with a lot of nuts; pineapple; and strawberry. It's no Ted Drewes frozen custard; but it'll do for Arizona!  Service was fast and friendly.,1

1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,This place was so bad. Service was slow. We got the single burger; fries & chocolate shakes. The burger was paper thin. No really no exaggeration. The fries were good but the sauce was just thousand island. The shakes were so thick you couldn't use a straw there are so many better burger places. Don't waste your time or money.,0
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,The crew at this location are always upbeat and friendly. Always greeted with a smile. Service is great; food is great. If you only get one thing (and good luck with that as it all smells and tastes awesome) get the frozen custard. SOOO good!,1
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,"This place is awesome! I don't have a lot to say but the 10 pounds I put on since they have opened near my office speak for themselves! Their courteous employees make all the difference. I don't think they know the word \no\"". Special orders do not confuse them; they happily oblige. That's the way it should be!""",1
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,Another reviewer who was also unsatisfied with the new mini Steak n Shake in Tempe suggested Freddy's.  WOW; what a nice surprise to have a steakburger that tastes great; fast and friendly service and a clean restaurant.  The menu is three to four times bigger than S & S.  I have been there twice now and was pleased every time; as were my friends.  Good Job!!!,1
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,Being from St. Louis and having Ted Drews and Bobby's custard finding the is gem for yummy custard in Arizona  is awesome.  This location is walking distance to my house and always friendly service. Will make this a weekly treat stop. I can't say much for the food since were not really burger and fry types. But the custard is worth the trip.,1
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,YES!  I loved this place.  Had a double cheeseburger plain (bread; meat; cheese) and the flavor; texture; size was just perfect.  The peanut butter cup and banana concrete was super good.  My only complaint is cost.  It is quite pricey.  We ordered one burger; an order of 3 chicken tenders; a small milkshake; a small concrete and a small sundae.  Our bill was $22.  We had no fries; no drinks.,0
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,This Freddy's Customer service was incredible for a fast good restaurant; the menu was simple but far from boring and the next to no wait time for our delicious food was exactly what my family needed when meal plans at home didn't come to fruition. Burgers; Chicago dog and patty melt were delicious....now we'll have to come back to try their custard; on a non school night of course!,1
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,I've come to this location a couple times and arrived back at home with the order wrong.   They're quite pricey too; so when you drive off with your order you expect them to get it right. The burgers are okay; the fries are good; the frozen custard is pretty good too. Most recent order was a frozen custard with brownie pieces.  My cup came out with the brownie pieces in the bottom of the container and the custard was simply filled on top of the brownie.  I thought the additions were mixed in. I know you're not supposed to make assumptions.,0
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,I always drive by this place on my way home from work;  so decided to stop by.   Ordered the double bacon burger combo with shoe strong fries;  and it was completely impressed.   First the burger;  the meat was tender;  and the lettuce;  tomato and pickles were all fresh;  a pretty good feat considering I went there 20 minutes before closing.   The burger meat was pressed thin and cooked perfectly;  and had great flavor.  The fries were shoestring; cooked nice and crisp and salted to  perfection.   I can't wait to go back and order another burger;  but next time;  I'll try some custard too.,0
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,Freddy's at Elliott and McClintock has only been open a few days and is looking to be a worthy addition to the neighborhood.  The burger was large and thin (having obviously been smashed on the grill); edges were a little crispy and taste was generally quite good. Cheese was melted between the burgers and added some moisture and what my eldest daughter likes to call cheesy goodness.  Fries were  a little disappointing.  While the meat seemed to be of good quality for a fast food place; the fries weren't thin enough to be crispy or thick enough to be tasty.  I don't put catsup on my fries; but these needed it.  They were dry and lacking in taste.  So four stars for the burger; one star for the fries; five stars for pleasant smiling service in a drive thru.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.  Since it's new and I'm the first reviewer and I'm delighted to have a new dining option near my home; I'm rounding up to 5 stars.,1
1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,The name describes in perfect order what I liked best. Frozen custard over the steakburger. My girlfriend and I rolled in at about 10:30 after a 2-mile run determined to completely throw away the exercise we had just done. We landed on the Turtle concrete mixer based on the giant sign hanging above the register; which called to me like a sirens song in the night. It's aura of deliciousness was too enticing to pass up. Next I decided to add a steakburger to the order because I felt it was essential to complete the full; first-time experience.   When our order arrived at our table just a couple of minutes later I noticed the burger looked a little greasy; but what the hell; I dove right in. I found the burger to be overly salty and left something to be desired flavor wise. As for the concrete mixer; due to the temperature of the hot fudge they threw in it turned out to be more like a glass of chocolate soup. I would have expected this if I ordered a fudge sundae; but it's not really what a concrete mixer should be. Overall; the flavor was very good.   The staff was super friendly and helpful and I enjoyed the decor; but honestly I was hoping for a little more from this place.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"The burgers are tasty; with fresh ingredients. The shakes here are decent; and a good deal for the price. The atmosphere though... well... that's another story. I've been to several Steak 'n Shakes in the Midwest; and this one is more like a \Steak 'n Shake Express.\"" I guess that's what makes this \""Steak 'n Shake Signature\"" restaurant different; but in ways that make me miss the original versions of the chain. This isn't a diner- it's more like eating at an In N Out or a Fatburger. There's just a small seating area; you order and pick up at the counter; and it is not open 24/7. The menu is very limited as well; with less to offer than the diner versions.  The general feel of the place is more modern; and more hip. Top 40 music plays on the speakers; the interior and even the font signage out front has a contemporary feel. They even have one of the new Coke soda fountains that allow you to pick various flavor combinations. Back when I used to live in the Midwest; I had many memories of having late night eats at various Steak 'n Shakes with friends; indulging in greasy burgers and fries on white plates; and lusciously thick shakes in glass milkshake cups. Eating at this Steak 'n Shake makes me long for the actual diner; although the food itself still tastes the same. For me; some of that magic is lost for this particular restaurant when I am eating in a small area with a large crowd of people; getting my order at the counter; and eating my burger; fries; and shake in a fast-food type manner.  We went here on a Sunday around noon. We got in before the big rush; since a few minutes after we ordered; there was a line out the door; winding around the block! Our order took maybe 10-15 minutes to be made; and seating was limited.   I ordered the Royale; partially because it conjured images of Samuel L. Jackson talking about a Royale with Cheese in Pulp Fiction; and partially because the addition of bacon and egg to a burger sounded delicious. The order came with fries; and I also had some of a banana milkshake. The Royale was indeed delicious; with juicy; flavorful ground beef; fresh tomato; crisp lettuce (Green leaf; not the cheapo iceberg lettuce!); melted cheese; a smoky salty flavor from the bacon; and a nice rich; creamy texture and taste from the fried egg. The bun was soft and held up well with the other ingredients. The shake was OK. It tasted more like imitation banana flavored syrup rather than fresh banana mixed in with ice cream; but at $3; hey what do I expect?  The fries were thin; and slightly crispy. They were decent; but the real star of the meal was the burger.   I will be waiting the day that perhaps a full service Steak 'n Shake can open in the Phoenix area. Until then; this express version will have to do!""",0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,If you want to visit a Steak and Shake like the ones you know from back East or the Midwest; do NOT go to this one.  This is a poor version of Steak and Shake that has a walk up counter and only burgers; fries; hot dogs and shakes.  The fries are also NOT the same as regular Steak and Shakes and to me; not as good.  I don't like anything about this place.  There is no parking; the inside seemed dirty to me; I don't like getting a reservation buzzer just for putting in a food order; I didn't like the little plastic boxes they put the food in if you eat in and I didn't like the small size cup they gave me for my drink.  Skip this place all together.  If you want to visit the closest 'real' Steak and Shake the one in Vegas is pretty good.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,This is my first time coming here and my last I place my order at 7:24pm I'm just now getting my food at 7:52pm the rest of the employees was moving Hella slow well at least the employee say thank you,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,I enjoyed my first time ever at a Steak'n Shake; at this location in Tempe; but my boyfriend is from Ohio and said this is very different than Midwestern locations of the franchise; so I am writing on his behalf to warn any Midwestern transplants in Phoenix about this location: you order at the counter (it is not sit-down) and you wait or they bring it to you- much like Panera. Service was slow and they did mess up my boyfriend's order (forgot some sauce or other) but were quick to remedy that. They had not refilled the ketchup and overall it was an okay dining experience; but not like the Steak'n Shakes you may be used to. Either way; this location will probably be a cash cow for its proximity to the university.,0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Have never been to a Steak 'n Shake before; but have heard things about it! Went in 3 days after they opened and it was pretty busy but not to bad. They had someone give us a menu as we entered and was very nice! All the employees were very nice; so service gets 5 stars.  I ordered the Western Burger with fries and a Cookies and cream shake! Thought i had to because it had shake in the title so I needed to try them out! We waited about 20 min; not bad with how many people were there. We took food home since there was no where to sit.   The burger was AWESOME! Tasted fresh; bun was good and the toppings were great. The shake wasn't very good. It was icy and had really no taste.,1

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Tried to eat here. Finally ordered after 10 min in a line that barely moved and waited for about 35 min before we asked where our order was. They couldn't even find it anywhere. It wasn't on the screen or being made..nothing. Well; considering I had other things to do I had to leave. Won't be back.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,The best food and service! First time here!! and it's nice and clean.christan in the front was super friendly and knowledgeable about the food.thank you I will be returning!,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Not sure why there are so many rough reviews on here... I waited in line; but it went quickly. I waited for my food; but it was less than 10 minutes. Everything came out exactly as I ordered it. The burgers were GREAT....The price was a little high; but it was a big step up from any of the fast food burgers too. We had a pretty big order with no mistakes; so I'm wondering if they are improving since the dates of the prior reviews. I've even gone back a couple of time with other family members who came to town and it's been the same. Hopefully I don't ever have the experiences the other folks who downrated the place have had....,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,The food is mediocre; but could be forgiven if the service was better.  The fries were so over salted I only ate about 2 or 3 before they were discarded.   The employees just don't seem to care!   The guy at the table next to us opened his burger to find everything but the beef! His burger was literally missing the beef patty! Serious lack of attention to detail here.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Meh I've been here a couple of times and it was just ok. A few of my friends had hyped this place up so I expected it to be amazing. The menu seemed a lot smaller then what was online. The shakes were also just ok. For the price I also expected better. It's not horrible; but it is definitely not the first place I'd go for a burger.   Also the service isn't excellent. I think it's kind of weird how all the girls have red lipstick; and nails. The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu. I'd much rather go to the In-N-Out down the road.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"I too am a native Midwesterner. I too am highly disappointed by this \signature\"" steak and shake. I agree with everyone complaining about the fries. Mine were old and way too salty. I like to tear up my fries and put them in my chili and it sort of ruined the chili. The service was very fast and I'm sure I will return at some point but I feel like a kid who just found out Santa isn't real. You still enjoy Christmas but its' just not the same anymore.""",1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Well I was excited to come here and even stopped in on a night I could have gone to another burger joint.    When I left I wish I had just got to Fatburger on Mill; last weekend I went to Chuckbox and was glad I did.   Even Five Guys which I am not a fan is 10x times better than the Signature Burger from Steak N Steak.    First start with the positive;  the place was clean and well lit.   Next the ordering went smooth but the staff didn't seem to know much about the burgers.    First they give you everything in a bag making it hard to eat for someone eating in the place;  second my burger was drowning in ketchup.    The fries were cold;  I had to ask for new fries.    The shake was okay; I tried a different flavor but it was not thick enough maybe even watery at times.     The restaurant was not that busy;  but enough people were there around 10:30pm on a Saturday night.    This Kerstin chick must work for the restaurant;   if they can't afford to open Steak N Steak's the right way shouldn't give us a half-attempted location.   I probably will never eat there again; if ever in the Midwest  I will look for a Culver's or Freddy's Steakburger.    This half attempt has lost me as a customer for a lifetime.   I wish all businesses good luck but I wish an In-N-Out burger would open instead.    Save your money and go to a real burger joint.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,After months of hype around a location opening in Arizona; I couldn't help but feel let down. For anyone who's expecting a normal hometown experience; this 'Signature' Steak 'n Shake is not going to cut it. Imagine a Steak 'n Shake next to Terminal B36 at an Airport and this is what your walking into.  1. The menu - 1/3 the size at a normal Steak 'n Shake 2. The Steakburger and Milkshake - exactly as expected  3. The fries - come standard with this strange red spice (found out you can ask to have them plain)  I'm giving this 3 stars because of the emotional letdown. The staff was friendly; I received my order quickly and the food tasted normal except for the fries. My guess is Steak 'n Shake went with a 'Signature' option because the model generates more revenue than their traditional sit-down-and-be served locations. Well Steak 'n Shake; this may be true; but you wont be capturing my dollars again anytime soon.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,My kids and I shared the Original with a Birthday Cake milkshake. The burger was delicious and the shake was amazing. Seriously; I want another shake ASAP! The fries were a little thin and crispy for my liking; but my kids had no trouble finishing off every last one.   The best part (after the milkshake) was the customer service. I knocked my shake off my table and they nicely offered to make me a new one for free. Then; when it was time to leave; one of the workers came out from behind the counter and helped me get a double stroller; two babies; and a milkshake out the door.   We will be back!,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Good food but nothing overwhelmingly fantastic. My family and I ate here last night and ordered a good chunk of the menu. Everyone was satisfied and it was really affordable for a large family. We also ordered a shake but it wasn't that good. Overall good food and I'd come back again,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,I've been here twice now. Both times they got my order wrong. The first time they made up for it by getting me some more fries. The second time I didn't bother going back. It was Saturday night and traffic was crazy. I decided to leave this review instead. I asked for no cheese; onion or pickle and the burger came standard with everything on it. It's like they didn't even try. The burgers; once made correctly; are decent. The shake was alright. Not great. I may give it one more try but so far I'm not impressed. I'll go to Freddy's next time instead.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,I have to admit I was hoping for the best;  especially since they have banana milk shakes which is all time family favorite.  The decor is cute however the staff lags on cleaning up tables.  Speaking of the staff; the two guys were too busy slacking off while the cook was taking orders and making the meal.  Oh; and the banana milk shake tasted like tapioca pudding so clearly not real bananas.   We ordered 2 Signature steak burgers; which looked good but ended up more like Signature grease burgers on stale bread. The meal comes up with shoe string fries that were greasy; burnt; and when I got to 1/2 way in the box were more like the crumbs of french cries of fries; REALLY!  We ate 1/2 our meal and pitched it; not worth shitting on the potty the rest of the night.  Yes; that greasy!   I would suggest going to the chuck box down the street.  But hey; thanks for the wifi I posted this review with.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Decent food at best but fair on price. The server we had who took our order was absolutely awful. Didn't get his name but he was a grown African American adult who was acting like a child when I was trying to place my order. Also left his command station to hit on a girl and try to get her number as he watched the line pile up. Won't be back anytime soon that's for sure.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,For anyone that is actually from Illinois to defend this place is ridiculous.  The parking is horrendous; beer and wine?  Organic burgers?  HOT DOGS?  Really?  When I saw S & S I wanted a S & S and oh what''s up with the menu being overhead?  Got a headache just from looking up to read it.  Walked out without ordering a thing.  No thanks.  I will just depend on Walmart for the cans of REAL chili and make my own chili mac.   I grew up with three of these places in my hometown and even worked at one when I was a teen.  This is a total disappointment.   I'll wait til the new and real franchises come to town.  I don't care how much the investor put into this place either.  If he wanted to do a half as*ed job then that's exactly what he did too.  The location of this place makes it very clear that all they wanted to cater to is the college kids.  And for this old lady (55 years old) the college kids can have it.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"OK folks I'm seriously getting irritated with the one and 2 stars because this location doesn't have the full menu.   All of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250;000 to open the new \Signature\"" location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future. They are getting their feet wet in the AZ market.   I'm from Illinois where Steak and Shake originated; and yes I am highly disappointed that I cannot get a Chili Mac or a Chili 5 way or my beloved Hot fudge milkshake here.   However I am delighted that I can at least still get a stellar Original Double Steakburger; Fries and a Chocolate shake. THANK YOU TO THE OWNERS FOR BRINGING THOSE! I APPRECIATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For those of you who are saying the burger is not the same; you are wrong!   You have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.  Order the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar.   Also Steak and Shake isn't like Freddy's Frozen custard; Freddy's Frozen custard is a knock off of Steak and Shake! Steak and Shake was founded in 1934; Freddy's 2002! NUFF SAID!  I've taken 3 or 4 people here and they loved it!""",0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"OK folks I'm seriously getting irritated with the one and 2 stars because this location doesn't have the full menu.   All of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250;000 to open the new \Signature\"" location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future. They are getting their feet wet in the AZ market.   I'm from Illinois where Steak and Shake originated; and yes I am highly disappointed that I cannot get a Chili Mac or a Chili 5 way or my beloved Hot fudge milkshake here.   However I am delighted that I can at least still get a stellar Original Double Steakburger; Fries and a Chocolate shake. THANK YOU TO THE OWNERS FOR BRINGING THOSE! I APPRECIATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For those of you who are saying the burger is not the same; you are wrong!   You have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.  Order the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar.   Also Steak and Shake isn't like Freddy's Frozen custard; Freddy's Frozen custard is a knock off of Steak and Shake! Steak and Shake was founded in 1934; Freddy's 2002! NUFF SAID!

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,The staff doesn't listen. I have been to this location twice and my order was messed up both times. I don't know what it is but they don't listen. They are always very disorganized. Quick serve usually means you should get your food within a 3-8 minutes. In my most recent trip I waited 25 minutes for my food and it wasn't even busy! They need a better staff. Their staff shows no care for the customer. There's a 5 guys across the street and an In-N-Out 1 miles away. Your service would be better AND FASTER at one of those burger joints.,0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"Well; being from the MidWest; I was super excited; on our cross-country road trip (two summers ago) to introduce my own family to SnS.  It did not disappoint and we had SnS atleast 4 times during the 3 week outing.  The following year (last year) when we repeated that trip; we were sure to stop by SnS (kids were practically begging).  On that trip; we even asked them when they might bring one our way.  Little did I know that they had already planned it.  When I told my kids that Steak 'n Shake would; indeed; open a restaurant in the valley; they couldn't wait.  Well; after discovering that it was already opened; my wife and I ventured out to the SnS Signature restaurant to enjoy some great fast food.  I read the reviews on Yelp (prior to heading out) and prepared her for the reality that the experience would not be like we were used to.  Having said that; we pleased with the food we received.  I ordered the Original and my wife had the Western BBQ & Bacon.  The food was received promptly; and was delicious.  My only comment (as it relates to the food) would be a lack of consistency in the fries.  Because they are cut so thin (shoestring) they varied from very crispy (almost burnt) to something more palatable.  The service was great (on par with what you might expect to find in other \counter-service\"" restaurants.  It definitely was not the Steak 'n Shake experience that we were used to; but given the choice between not having a local SnS and having to drive several hours to get the full SnS menu / experience; I think SnS Signature is an acceptable alternative (for now).  I do; however; echo the sentiments of others requesting that SnS bring the full diner experience to AZ.""",1

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,where to start.. good; bad; or ugly?  First off; i am from the midwest; but i have lived in Arizona most of my life; Steak 'n Shake is my FAVORITE place to eat back home; this location... i will NOT go again (maybe) It has none of the charms like the original; no host(ess); no bar to sit and watch them smash your burger and cook it; only about 50% of the menu; no server to take your order and refill your dr pepper; no sauces sitting out for your food drowning pleasure; and no physical menus you can hold while you decide which tasty burger or dessert you want.. what there is though; are giant tv screens; a touchscreen soda machine; annoying music; and an awkward patio.    where was i.. covered bad and ugly.. oh yeah; the royale was tasty because #iloveegg; and the frisco melt was great too.  But i can get that anywhere; the ambiance sucked.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"I woke up yesterday morning with three words on my mind: \STEAK AND SHAKE.\""  Working across the street from this location; I was getting a little worried (okay; a lot worried) as the morning dragged on and my inbox became flooded with the e-mails of equally concerned co-workers panicking about the long line that was building up ahead of the grand opening. I work with quite a few people from the east coast; who had been telling me nothing but good things about the Steak 'n Shake chain ever since we found out one was opening on Mill. Luckily; once doors opened at 11 the line moved through quite quickly and me and my equally hungry coworkers had a window to grab our long-awaited fast food before the next wave started around noon.  I ordered the Original (it being opening day and my first time at a Steak 'n Shake; I had to go with the signature) with fries and a Cookies and Cream milkshake (trust me; you'll want to order the milkshake). Within ten minutes; my burgers and fries were gone and I was onto the milkshake. Hey; I'd pretty much been hungry all morning and the panic about the line didn't hurt.  I'd say this is comparable to an In 'N Out; but with a slightly pricier menu and more selection. I'm sure opening day won't be anywhere close to the last time I order from here.""",0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Very disappointed after hearing about SNS opening the only store in Arizona.  Ordered the original cheese burger with regular fries; for other type of fries; you would have to pay extra for it.  The only good thing coming out of this place is probably the Coke machine where you can mix different drinks together.  Other than that; you probably get better burgers at nearby fastfood joints.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,So I had never heard of Steak 'n Shake but I guess it's something big in the Midwest. Super friendly service here at the Mill Avenue location and dynamite burgers. You've got your choice of all kinds of different styles and toppings which is nice. The fries are super crispy (perfect) and nicely portioned. Good music playing while we were there and the place is clean! Oh; and by the way... the milkshakes are phenomenal. Don't miss 'em. Especially the salted caramel pretzel milkshake. OMG.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Unless you're a poor college student I recommend staying away from here (in fact; just stay away from Tempe in general).    The place is fairly clean; kind of small; and the tables are slightly too large for the space.  I ordered and the cashier acted like it was my fault she had to work there; totally rude.  The buzzer system was really annoying.  It would ring when one thing was ready; then you had to wait again for next part; then again; again...  With all the people working there you think they would be able to get the whole order ready; and then bring it to you.  The food was average to below average.  I tried the original burger; it had a double patty; cheese and the usually toppings and came with fries.  The burger was under seasoned and had no flavor.  The fries tasted old; and I asked for plain fries but there were nasty vinegar and cheese ones mixed in.  Overall; I give this place a thumbs down.  If you want a good fast food burger I recommend Five Guys or Lenny's.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"Actually kind of surprised this place has such low reviews; but I'd agree. Let's be honest; a lot of AZ and Cali natives don't know a good hamburger when they see one and hop onto the new hype easily; no offence! I'm from Chicago and we are all about keeping good food and service around in the Midwest!  I used to eat at SnS in Illinois pretty often; I liked that it was sit down and diner style. Kind of disturbed at this new trend of making nice quaint restaurants into impersonal fast food shacks. I had a plain burger and fries and my friend had some toppings on the burger with fries and a shake. I was kind of shocked at how mediocre the shake was; really disheartening. The burger seemed slightly undercooked and the bun was cold and soft/mushy... fries were average; not what I remember! They messed up our order 2x times and had to wait over 30min to get it right; thank goodness we had time or I be really p-oed. Actually found out they had forgotten about us as well (idk how that happens!).  I finished the burger cause I was starving by then but I couldn't finish the fries and that never happens! Ouch. Oh and by the way; it is most certainly NOT* the \In n Out of the Midwest\"". I like I-n-O alright but the actual SnS in the Midwest is a much higher supreme creation.""",0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Why are the other reviews for this place so bad?!  I had a pretty good experience.    I ordered an eggnog shake and a footlong hotdog to go and it was an easy ordering exerience and my food came out less than 7 minutes after I placed my order.  Eggnog shake was GREAT (was worried about it being too much) and the hotdog was surprisingly good.  (I was sober- it's rare when hot dogs are good sober- unless you're at a baseball game.)   Service was pretty good; food was pretty good.... overall a good experience!,1

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,I really really wanna like this place but there is just something that is off. The skinny Back story Before I decided to purchase vehicle I used to ride the light rail home mon-fri I would travel east on university exit mill ave and walk to light rail station. I one day saw the sign for a steak and shake I def got excited as I have heard of this chain from family and friends in Illinois and as a lover of shakes. They had a great prices a good size burger and fries for 4$ the burger is def a greasy bastard but what do u expect from a burger. Taste wise was ok no real distinct seasoning on it pretty bland but it was ok. The fries are great the first time they were pretty salty but they have since gotten better the only problem is they have a lot of crumbs and fries edges. The milkshake tastes like leaving ice cream with out a lid in freezer and it getting that freezer burn taste; everytime I go back I just skip the shake but I may give it another shot soon. Service is great and fast parking can and usually is a nightmare.  This place deserves more of a 2 1/2 stars instead of 3 but they are def not a 2 I have had worse burgers and for the price I'm not complaining I have gone back a few times pretty much cause they gave me and my girl a free burger on our birthday which she gave to me :-) score!! I will still go back cause I do love the cheese fries just hook up more fries please.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,After growing up in the midwest and frequenting Steak 'N Shake; we were excited that it finally came to Tempe.  While it is not the full service restaurant that we are used to; the burgers are still flavorful; and the fries are great.  Happy that they finally have one here - will go back for sure.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,These guys were so nice to put up with me; I had no idea what I wanted to order; and different toppings from different burgers sounded really good; so I asked the cashier what she recommended and she said I could just order the cheaper burger and add the toppings I wanted from the more expensive burger and it would be cheaper!! So of course I did this! And it was absolutely flipping delicious. Usually substitutions and additions will cost you more; but they were willing to give me some wiggle room on the price and give me the best of both worlds- in reference to the sandwich; if i remember correctly It was a burger on toast with bacon and an egg and some different cheeses and it was biblical. I would pray to that burger. What really impressed me was how patient and helpful the staff was to someone who needed some extra attention to have a good experience. I know I'm not the easiest customer to deal with all the time; so when I'm taken care of; I take note and appreciate it. Many business lack this kind of professionalism; but not this place! And it's on Mill Ave! I couldn't work on mill ave and maintain composure like these guys; I have a low tolerance for college crowds and  public inebriation. Just enough tolerance to go to steak n shake; eat a delicious meal; and go back home. Stay strong; steak n shake workers; stay strong. I love you.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Had the signature burger... It literally was like eating a pile of salt. I couldn't even down my first bite. The fries were good and shakes were too. The service was awesome but I'll stick to the ones in the Midwest...,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Finally...a Steak 'n Shake in AZ. Having grown up in the Midwest I've definitely missed them. Unfortunately I'm still waiting for one.   Before coming here I did my research and know the difference between full and signature versions. Yet I'm still giving it a poor review; after 3 trips here now.   Trip 1 - Monday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins. Waited for food for 10 mins; which was good because it took 5 mins of waiting for a table to sit at. BBQ burger was ok.  Trip 2 - Thursday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins again. Waited another 25 mins for food!   Took 10 mins this time to get a table. They forgot to put the lettuce on the burger. Was good tasting but not great. Got to sit and listen to guy arguing with manager.  He said the cheese in his burger was still frozen. She said they don't heat it up and he said he understood that but this was actually frozen; not cold. She offered to make him another one but he didn't hVe time since the wait had used up his lunch break. She didn't offer him a refund but instead took his name so next time he comes in they can give him something. Not good customer service.   Trip 3 - Sunday lunch. Line wait was 5 mins. Pretty quick. Choice of tables since restaurant was less than half full. Shake wait was 2 mins; and food wait was another 5 mins. Definitely faster.  Food was a little worse than previous trips. BBQ burger was smothered in sauce with very little onion strings so it was hard to eat.   Overall Not pleasant experiences.  Music is constantly too loud. People next to us were complaining as well since you have to practically yell to talk to each other.  Wait times during normal lunch times is way too long. I've never waited that long at a full steak and shake and it should be much faster here.  Single size drink sucks. Give us multiple sizes to choose from.  Garbage can opening are barely large enough for the tray to fit in to let alone flip them to empty the garbage.  Seating area wayyyyyy to small.  Food is definitely not the quality of a true steak and shake. If your not going to be one; don't use the name.   Hope this review helps  - still waiting for a steak and shake in AZ,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,It's about time that Steak N Shake came to the valley. I LOVE the frisco melt; it's crazy greasy deliciousness. The place is clean and the service is friendly; which to be honest; feels weird when I'm used to a surly waitress giving me the stink eye when I order my food at this chain.    I wish they'd stay open 24 hours like standard Steak N Shakes; but ah well. I don't mind the smaller menu; but I do mind that they do not have the peppers. They are missing some key elements that dispite the smaller menu they could do better.  I agree with a fellow reviewer that the milkshakes are not Steak N Shake quality. However; I'm willing to overlook all of that for my Frisco melt with fries and a side of cheese sauce.,1

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"Just to be clear; there is no steak.  It is a burger place. Think \In and out\"" with way better french fries and great milkshakes.  Very clean and new.  The waitresses have to wear black mini skirts with black boots (feel sorry for them in the summer)  You order at the counter; they give you a light up pager to pick up your food.  The organization of the counter is a little screwy because to get to the drink machine you have to cut through the line of people waiting to order.  The birgers are good; again very similar to In and Out burgers.  No complaints.  Fries are very skinny and taste better than most.  Milkshake was good (hard to mess up a chocolate milkshake) and this location has a really nice outdoor patio on Mill Ave so people watching is cool.  It is a good burger joint but competing with Five Guys; In and Out.  I can imagine going back there again but it isn't a top spot in my book.""",0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,I used to eat at Steak and Shake in St. Louis when I lived there so I was excited that they were in Tempe.   The burger was excellent but you have to order a signature burger with fries whether you want them or not. Fries were greasy; burger was not over cooked and juicy. This is not the Steak and Shake I remember; it was like stopping at a fast food place. The shakes are still creamy and delicious.   I am a bit disappointed; did not have the full menu including the chili. I will try it again.  Parking here is a challenge; limited seating. I am surprised as this is a college town and the place was packed with lots of people waiting for seats.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Not bad; not great.  With the word shake in your name; i'd expect the shakes to be delicious.  I had a mint; cookie shake; I give it 2 stars.  tasted like a McDonalds shake w/ cookie chunks in it.  The burger was decent (Western BBQ N'Bacon) but small.  Fries were of the thin variety.  Service was good and food was up quickly.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Let me preface this by saying that I was raised on Steak 'N Shake and am from where it originated. It's been a family institution for 8 decades. My parents frequented the original SnS. My grandparents frequented the original SnS & knew the Belt family. For all the Yelpers out there; I simply ask that; before you write off Steak 'N Shake based on a 'Signature' 1/2 store that is the Tempe location; please try eating at an actual sit-down classic Steak 'N Shake restaurant. The Signature store is NOTHING like the real deal. No exaggeration.   On to the review:  Finally tried Steak 'N Shake in Tempe today. Verdict: HIGHLY disappointed. Ordered original double cheese w/ fries. Zero crispy edges on slightly warm; mushy burger. ZERO CRISPY EDGES ON A STEAK 'N SHAKE ORIGINAL BURGER?? Crispy edges are a REQUIREMENT and WHOLLY DEFINE an original Steak N' Shake burger since 1934; goddammit. Limp tasting; overcooked fries. In-N-Out Burger is multitudes better than SnS Signature; and I don't even particularly like In-N-Out. A manager stopped by & asked how things were; and I just told him 'As a guy whose family is from Normal; Illinois; we've been eating @ Steak 'N Shake literally from day 1 - /for 80 years now/ & I wouldn't dream of bringing them to this location.' Everything was just 'off'. Not a single thing tastes or feels familiar about this 'Signature' location. It's really almost as if it's not even affiliated with the regular restaurants. The two friends I brought with me today said they'll never go back. I can't blame them. The /only/ thing going for this location is pricing. Contrast my Tempe experience with my most recent experiences at REAL SnS locations in Austin; TX last November & 2012 in Bloomington; IL: Pure joy. Everything was as it should've been.   I simply can't understand why they've chosen to roll these Signature stores out; it'd be almost as if In-N-Out Burger showed up in Peoria; IL & served ham salad sandwiches.   I think SnS is doing irreparable damage to their brand with these stores.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"I felt like failing at life this fateful night by consuming 1000+ calories; and this establishment for sure helped me accomplished that goal.   I ordered the Frisco Melt; which pleasantly reminded me of Jack in the Box's Sourdough Jack.  The bf ordered the Royale Burger; which is basically a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg.  Their fries are shoestring style; thin and crispy but nothing to write grandma about.  The burgers we had... were just burgers.  I will say this though; if you ever hear someone say \You can't eff up a burger\"" - that person is wrong.  You CAN eff up a burger.  This place though; did not.  It just wasn't out of this world.    Oh; I'm also a fiend for anything banana flavored.  Espesh banana shakes.  I ordered one from here and was sort of disappointed.  As banana-ey and flavorful as it was; it tasted too artificially sweet; in which I'm pretty sure they use artificial flavoring...  I've had better ( Joe's Farm Grill's banana shake is out of this world).  I'm just saying; if one of your specialties are shakes; then you should make 'em so that you ARE known for them.    In general; the prices are right ( about 5 bucks for a meal) and the flavor's aren't bad.  I would return if I were hungry and in the area.  It's not something I would repeatedly crave though.""",0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Food was great. Had never been to a fast food Steak 'n Shake. Would have rather had a full service restaurant. But all and all it's about the food. Yummy!!,0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,It was my first time coming to this place today. Came during my lunch hour; I was surprised it wasnt full of people! Service was good; very nice cashier upfront (I believe her name was Jamie). I ordered the original double cheese n fries. Omgggg! It was delicious! I saw the burger and thought I wouldnt get full lol but its actually the perfect size. I wasnt over stuffed when done and was very satisfying. The burger was a little greasy but sooooooo delicious! The fries... I wasnt a big fan; dont get me wrong; they are good but they are really thin so they are a little on the crispier side. Im not a fan of crispy foods. I would highly recommend this place!,1

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Parking is a royal pain in the butt since it is Mill Ave and you either have to find and pay for street parking or park in the lot and walk quite a bit.  The service wasn't great.  Not overly helpful or attentive.  Was unable to add seasoned fries onto my child's kids meal so she didn't get what she wanted.  I tried the Original Double.  I really didn't care for the meat; bread or toppings.  I didn't get what I ordered either... Bun; meat; cheese and ketchup.  There was a huge chunk of tomato on the bottom.  The fries were pretty good - super skinny.  The best part and the only thing I would come back for is the Salted Caramel Pretzel Milkshake.  Seriously yum!  My girls each had the grilled cheese kids meal.  They told me the grilled cheese tasted funny.  I wasn't interested in trying it to see why.  My best guess is they are used to cheese that isn't American so they didn't like it.  A little bummed as I was so looking forward to trying this place.,0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Nothing for the non farm eater. The veggie sandwich they do serve is too salty to taste anything else. Service was friendly and quick though.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,This review is based on the franchise concept of Steak 'n Shake. The negative reviews comparing it to a full version of Steak 'n Shake do not do it justice because it can not compare; different concept; limited menu; different service. At first; I was a little disappointed but when I asked the employee she explained the differences between the Signature and full version.   The burger was tasty; which is a lot coming from me because I am not a big burger person. I was slightly disappointed because the burger I ordered was supposed to come with crispy onion strings and I didn't realize they were missing until I was reheating my leftovers.  The fries are delicious. Perfect amount of salt and crispiness.  The shake was ok. Can't go wrong with a ice cream shake. But just average...probably not worth the price.  The food is very affordable but the shakes are a bit spendy; in my opinion.   I will definitely be back.,0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,This place is GREAT! My boss took us here for lunch the second day they were open because it is his fave burger joint and since he moved from the Midwest; he hasn't been able to find one down here. I moved from MI so I can relate. Even though we went on the second day they were open and the place was a little packed; the service was fast AND friendly. I got the regular cheese burger and fries meal for $3.99 with a Mint Choco Chip shake that was to DIE for. There is nothing to say about the food other than you can't beat it. Burger Who? and forget McDonald's--I'll never ever eat there again! I have to be honest; I can't wait to go back.  We ordered four meals and two shakes all for under $30! You CAN'T BEAT THAT!  Great experience; great environment; great location (although parking leaves a little to be desired); and AMAZING FOOD! Go here. Order anything. You'll be happy!,1

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,First ate at Steak and Shake in New York by the David Letterman Theater when it was raining so hard we needed some shelter so we ran inside and then decided to grab a bite.   This location on Mill Ave by ASU is nice and clean and after you order the give you a pager to let you know your order is ready.   I ordered the Royal which has bacon and egg along with fries and of course a oreo shake.  The burger is pretty good for fast food and the fries are shoestring style. Both are above average and very good for fast food.  The shake was not as cold as I expected but was pretty good.  The order came out within 5 minutes and we ended up having it to go.  Great location and for the money the food is well prepared.   When I come back to ASU I will certainly keep this place in mind to come back to.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"Service was horrible!!! First time eating there and probably my last. We had to ask 5 times for someone to come wipe the table we were trying to sit at. We even asked if we could have the rag and do it ourselves. A table ended up opening before we got our food and the table we were going to sit at continued to stay dirty for almost our whole meal. The girl at the cash register was a complete idiot. She told us she had to help the people walking in to order before she could clean the table we were trying to sit at. Seriously?!? From the time people stood there figuring out what to order she could have cleaned off the table! She turned around and asked 2 other girls that worked there if they could clean the tables; they also acted like they were \super busy\"" and couldn't clean.  Although the food was fantastic; I have to give one star due to service.""",0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Ordered the organic burger. It was good;  but not 7 dollars good.  I also hate the fact that you HAVE to get fries.  The service was quite curt; and we got our food in 15-20. All in all; a decent alternative to In N Out.,0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,After letting the hype settle down; I decided to pay a visit to Steak 'n Shake today and was sadly disappointed. While the building and decor is somewhat nice; everything else left a lot to be desired.  The bullet points: -Steak burger was good if unremarkable. -Shake was good; though again unremarkable. -Ordered my food for dine-in; still came out in a paper bag as if I had asked for it to go.  But what is really troubling is how unclean the place feels. At ~3pm; the area between the soda machines was stained and dirty; and I don't recall seeing a single table wiped down in the half hour or so I was there. Mine certainly wasn't when I sat down; and none really seemed cleaner than another.  As has been touched on earlier; the employees seem to be the issue here; as they simply don't seem to get it. Yes; one greeted me when I walked in; but as far as keeping this relatively new place presentable; they didn't seem to get it.  Also; the dual buzzer system is confusing and somewhat annoying; though a relatively minor inconvenience. Why it's that way is beyond me; hopefully it is something gets addressed.  For my first and likely only visit to this Steak 'n Shake; I left less than impressed by this place that came with high expectations. Better to go around the corner to a locally owned institution and get a burger there.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,I really liked this place.  I went there after a night of drinking on Mill and you could tell the workers were down for about anything (especially after I asked the *male* cashier to flash me some titty for beads). Even after that exciting introduction he was super pleasant and accommodating of my paleo sensibilities (no bread; cheese; anything processed or fried).  And the food was good!   Nothing beats good food and good service.  I will definitely be back.,1
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,When I think of Steak 'n Shake I think of what should be a pleasant experience.   For starters the person that took the order was not very friendly. She seemed more preoccupied with texting on her cell phone than serving customers. I ordered a burger combo.   The burger had good flavor and was loaded. However the fries were very cold and skimpy. The drink machine was not working properly because the choices were either out or not serviceable. Overall the place could have been a bit more clean. The tables were dirty and not wiped down in some time.   Other customers next to us expressed they were not happy with the quality of food received. It seemed to set the tone overall of this particular place.   The prices seem reasonable but should be reflective of the product. On this occasion it was not. This is not what I would expect from Steak 'n Shake. Perhaps another location may be suggested.,0

CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,My order is always wrong. There hasn't been a single time I've been in here that my order has been right.   The place looks and feels like the person who put it together had NEVER been in the restaurant business before. I mean honestly; have you used their trash cans? How about having a buzzer system that makes you get up for your food twice every time? Once for your shake and once for your food.   Honestly; the food is GREAT when it is correct; which means NO mayo or NO tomato.   The robot employees could have a little more character as well.,0
CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,So for all the years I had to hear how great this place is from family and business friends I finally went down to check it out.  Go for the shakes; don't go for anything else.  I know this is nothing like the ones east of Arizona but they really need to tell people that the amazing menu online is nothing like what you see when you come to this Mill Ave location. This limited menu is a dissappointment compared to the real Steal N Shakes.  As for the service ALOT of bad things going on down there as other reviews have stated. The trash cans are just plain stupid. The fact that the employees don't care about their jobs show and the amazingly stupid 2 buzzer system means this place will close in time. I watched everyone get their drinks in 5-10 minutes then wait 10-20 minutes to get their food.   The shakes are great. The one thing they got right. The burgers and fries ? Um why ? The fries are greasy the burgers are tasteless.  Overall  would only go back for the shakes and then would walk down to Jack in the Box for burgers that are better.  They need to re-think this location and would be better off opening a full steak n shake with a driv-thru and full menu plus get a staff that cares about their jobs.,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,"Wow; I am surprised at how far this place has gone downhill! I came in here the other night after not being in for a while; and for how dead they were (every time I go in here; the place is dead; so--how are they staying in business?); the service was inexcusably slow. Isn't this supposed to be \fast food\""? The manager was unresponsive to my comment to that effect. There was also a cockroach just inside the front door; so maybe the health department should get involved. Also; just yesterday I hit Whole Foods' sushi bar; and for about the same price got a truly fresh product; so I won't be going back into Tokyo anytime soon.""",0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,"I went here for lunch disregarding the not so great reviews. When you first get there it's pretty abandoned looking; but once walking inside I was surprised by how many people were there. I thought; \GREAT! the reviews are wrong.\""  I ordered a las vegas roll and a teriyaki salmon. When I opened my box that help my roll...I was disapointed. The roll was very pale which normally indicates that it wasn't cooked long enough. I still gave it a try; and I could tase the doughy batter. Once I peeled off the outside of the roll I was left with cream cheese; salmon; and rice. The rice wasn't very good either...After about the third \""piece\"" I gave up after my stomach started to hurt. I would not recommend this roll; I would much rather go to RA and spend about the same amount of money on their sushi.   I haven't eaten the salmon; but from what I was seeing that and the chicken are very popular...Here's hoping when I'm feeling better; they will get an updated review.""",0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,My favorite thing about this Tokyo Express is that when I see it from my car; I know I have almost arrived to El Molino; which is right around the corner.   Oh; so back to the point; Tokyo Express is ok. I mean; I guess you have to be really trying to screw up a chicken teriyaki bowl; but the mere fact that they have the wherewithal to identify that as their specialty scores them some points so far as I'm concerned.   As for the sushi; I haven't gone there; but I have a sneaking feeling that I don't want to. I haven't heard anything to support or contradict that sentiment; I'm just being honest. I feel like ordering sushi here would be the equivalent of ordering beef tar tare at McDonald's. They carry the ingredients; but I wouldn't recommend it.   For a quick chicken teriyaki bowl and a soda for less than eight bucks; look no further.,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Reached home with my order and it was the opposite of what I requested.  Called them and they simply told me that I ordered wrong.  I paid good money for something I could not eat.  Since when is chicken and a bowl full of white rice Teryaki Lite...  Ok; no time to go back - as they were not going to make it right anyway.  Tried to eat it... Chicken was dry as cardboard; and rice was a sticky mess.  Never again.  Save your money.,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,"They recently remodeled and put in a new sushi bar at this place.  Some people are hesitant walking into a \rice bowl\"" place and ordering sushi.  I always was; until they added this bar.  It inspired me to try  their sushi.  I liked it.    There is a combo that I always get.  Its a shrimp tempura roll (5 pieces); a spicy salmon (or tuna) roll (8 pieces); small side salad; cup of miso soup and I usually throw a drink on top of that.  I'm out the door stuffed for 10 bucks.  I have had this meal 3 times there in the past 3 weeks and I enjoy it every time.  Its absolutle the perfect place if you want to grab a quick bite of sushi on your own or don't feel like dealing with the sushi restaurant crowd.""",0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,STK  Culinary Ninja here.  I was famished so I left the shadows for a bit. When I ordered ; the nostalgia inducing favorites (such as Chicken Katsu; Tokyo Chicken; Karubi Beef) I remembered so well from high school would remain distant and in memory.  Being vegetarian now; it came down to the vegetarian staples.  I ordered as if channeling a sumo at his stable; in training.  Sumo consume a small breakfast when enabled and a small dinner but do get the benefit of one large vegetarian lunch! This midsized meal exceeded my expectations; so here now is the enlightenment and spiritual awakening.  Order: Steamed Vegetable Bowl; Side Of Curry; Kappa Maki Cucumber Roll; Sunomono Salad; Hot Tea  Entree; Steamed Vegetable Bowl: Staple  Culinary Thought: Eating this fast made me desire the larger portion; which sadly I eyed after I completed my bowl.  Ninja Eating Plan: Broccoli; cabbage and carrots with a light Teriyaki glaze over rice; which for a moderate fee can be switched with brown rice. The addition of gomashio (Japanese black and white salt granules) and shichimi (Japanese 7 spice pepper) nicely balanced out the flavoring.   Appetizer: O-Sunomono: Perfect for the 82 degree weather Appetizer: Curry: Meh.  Sides: I alternated hot and cool bites with the remaining brown rice from the entree. Hot curry over rice provided great warmth while the cold and pickled cucumbers helped to ease the palette after each eager bite.   Culinary Thought: Although the curry was passable; the severe absence of pickled onions; stewed potatoes or veggies at all made it; meh.  Waste not want not; this ninja made it all disappear.   Ninja Eating Plan: Alternated hot and cold bites; but O-Sunomono was gone first.  Sushi: Kappa Maki: Good  Culinary Thought: Fast food and elegant preparation in the same establishment?  Probably the only place in the world that can offer speed and sophistication in a fast food; casual dining setting.  Ninja Eating Plan: Simple cucumber and sesame seed 8 piece roll. Neatly wrapped up and gone in 90 seconds.  Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: Fast and affordable; just outside of Old-town. Will return twice before the first day of summer.,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,STK 2013  Ninja stomach silent but hungry.  Order: Soba Noodles; Side Curry; Small Salad; Side Vegetables  Entree: Soba  Culinary Thought: I enjoyed this; all while applying a not-so known noisy ninja noodle-noshing technique .  Whilst consuming noodles; it is the only time for ninja to make sounds!  Also; it allows one to truly experience the essence of  soba.  Come with me sometime for a demonstration.    Ninja Eating Plan: The season of winter was heavily upon the area at the time so it was appropriate.  I did negate the chicken provided; for this ninja is a vegetarian seeking the ultimate enlightenment. The gentle mix of gomashio (Japanese black and white salt granules) and shichimi (Japanese 7 spice pepper) nicely accompanied the broth but I do wish it was hotter due to my extensive ninja warrior training in the cold.  The noodles were the star of the dish; with the spinach playing a strong second shamisen.  Dessert: Chocolate Cake  Culinary Thought:  Normally ninja pass on dessert.  Tokyo Express is an exception to that ninja rule.  They KNOW dessert.   Gotten better since last time but I am eager to discover if it is even better now in 2013!  Happy New Year Tokyo Express!  P.S. I will return before the first blossoms of Spring after extensive ninja mountain training.  Itadakimasu!!!!!!!,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,I've eaten at this location at least 10-12 times and have never been disappointed.  The fact that it's been in business so long (early 80's?) certainly says something.  It definitely has that outdated; whitewashed decor with bad fake plants and too much lighting; but the food is solid; fast Japanese and is reasonably priced.  I also like the fact that they have a drive-thru.  I've tried a number of items on the menu including the Sushi combos; chicken/noodle salads and the low carb entrees w/ all veggies and no rice;  however; the last few times I've ordered the Bento Box B.  It offers a nice combination of flavors and satisfies my need for variety and spice.  Served in a somewhat traditional style bento box; it includes Thai Beef Salad (very noticeable heat factor); Teriyaki Chicken; steamed rice/mixed veggies; inside-out California Roll; edamame and a small egg roll which is either pork or beef.  I would also recommend Bento Box A which includes Yakiniku Beef w/ Cabbage; steamed rice/mixed veggies; Teriyaki Chicken; green salad w/ ginger dressing; edamame and an egg roll.  If I'm in the S. Scottsdale area and hungry for lunch; I will usually stop here.,1
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Opted to try a noodle soup. Description did not include that shrimp was part of the soup. Sadly; not being able to eat shrimp; my entire to-go order was a waste. No happy belly on this trip.,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,I could remember Tokyo Expresses were everywhere in the valley.  I loved their food.  I was surprise to see them around and excited to eat the food again.  We entered the place and it smelled like bleach.  STRONG.  It is ok.  We move to the menu and ordering area.  Everyone picked out their meal.  Ordered and sat down.  We got our food pretty quickly.  I got the Katsu Chicken meal (side sui may and drink).  The sauce in the Katsu was kinda of bland.  I remember the sauce was savory.  The sui may; I am sure was the pre-made frozen kind.  I was hungry so I ate it.,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,"I'm craving this right now.  I want my Ahi Tuna with veggies and brown rice.  SO Freaking good.  Or maybe I'll splurge and get an Oyako with chicken egg and onion with that yummy sauce over brown rice; or is that the Katsu bowl?  I get the names confused but they are both good in case I order the wrong thing.   While my friend is a huge fan of the Terriaki Lite bowl; I can honestly say I've never really had their terriaki bowl.  It's just not my thing; but I will say if you get the Terriaki Lite it's all white meat.    My friend and I used to go there for lunch and get their combos; which while more expensive than burger fast food - are SO much better.  Rather than \would you like fries with that\"" you get like 6 different options including edemame (her choice); california rolls (My choice) and a side salad with ginger dressing.  And then your choice of drink includes green tea - my fav - with free refils of course.  During the lunch hour they are always playing classical music.  How cool is that?    Final bonus - they have a drive through.  Healthy (ish) food on the go is awesome.  And what takes this from a 4 to a 5 stars for me.    Well....that and I'm craving some right now.""",0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,For the money.....great job! I don't know what I like more; the option to sub white rice with brown or the spa-like music playing at just the right level. The bamboo shades & slatted seats (however counter-service the place is otherwise) really made this eatery feel relaxing and soft and COOL on a warm day :) I wasn't sure what my taste buds really wanted that day. I played it safe and ordered something I could compare easily to other restaurants: Teriyaki chicken bowl was tasty & lite. I would have used a bit more sauce; but i tend to do that anyway; so maybe it was par for a good bowl presentation. They offer Bento box; some sushi; lots of veggie and fish options; and a kind approach to service with authentic smiles :) **Visit was 7/20/12,1

EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Stopped in for lunch. Ordered a #11 and my girl ordered a #1. Mine tasted good but was a little meh... only rice; chicken; and carrots. Jazz it up a bit! Her teriyaki chicken was good but kinda soy-saucey tasting. Egg rolls were awesome though!   Overall not bad but nothing amazing. Place was clean but kinda outdated and could use sprucing up. Bathrooms were old and beat... toilet in the woman's was cracked lol. specially for Scottsdale!,0
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Tried them for the first time and I will be a regular. Their chicken salad is my favorite thing and their teriyaki chicken was delicious. Fast service and courteous.,1
EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Tokyo Express defined the Quick Service Rice Bowl take out segment a long time ago.   For over 20 years I have frequented this establishment and been through all of its acquisitions; transitions; growth and downsizing.  One thing remains today: much of what was great is still the same.  The teriyaki sauce is the best (in the early days it was homemade fresh daily); the lemon ginger dressing for the salads should be bottled. Much of the menu has been duplicated by other similar restaurant concepts and in some cases; done better.  I can agree with the quality of the chicken on the regular rice bowls (dark meat) could be better; rather than raising the prices; lesser quality was chosen which was a shame. Two decades have allowed me to try everything on the menu and it is all great.  Standard Japanese fare served up quick and hot. Yum. Maybe its nostalgia but I really love this place and hope it continues to find its niche and endures another 20+ years Final Rating: 4.9 for consistency for many; many years of quick service and tasty meals; Thank you Tokyo Express.,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,It hurts my heart to give any Chipotle a one star.  Their chicken fajita burritos with pico and extra corn is to die for.   However; on one particular morning; this Chipotle really failed to deliver.  I was hung over and on my way to work and Chipotle got in my head... and once it gets in there; nothing else can deliver.  I ordered my delicious usual; but unfortunately the person creating my burrito didn't spread out any of the ingredients.  While eating I had 6 mouthfuls of just chicken and tortilla; then I had clumps of cold cheese and then an endless amount of veggies with no chicken or cheese in sight... disgusting.  It literally ruined my day.  Instead of getting an instant cure to my hangover; it took it to another level because I was overly annoyed and just unsatisfied.    I will return to my beloved Chipotle; but I'll be sure to keep a close eye on the creator.,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I eat here regularly. I get the same exact thing. No need for deviation.   Carnitas Burrito.  Black Beans. Rice. Sour Cream. Guacamole. Cheese.   What the fuck is up with $1.80 guac? Only in America. And no one is going to complain; because they deliver a consistent product time and time again.  Chipotle is the epitome of quick service food.,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,It's a chain; so you know what you're getting. The food is fresh and very good; the service is fast and friendly. I would give it five stars except there is the occasional piece of gristle that does not get trimmed out of the meat (usually in the chicken or steak; never in the pork or shredded beef).,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I *LOVE* this place!  Good food; super fast service.  The mgt team is super nice.  They're always up beat and friendly.,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,It feels kind of wrong giving Chipotle the same amount of stars that I gave Posh.   But its so delicious!  Chipotle is a great; quick meal without the heavy greasy feeling of fast food.  Their black beans; rice and tortillas are all vegetarian-friendly and their burritos can easily be made vegan without the sour cream and cheese. It is kind of a crap shoot how large your burrito will be - sometimes you get a lot; sometimes you get a little...but the flavor is always consistent.   This location gets super crowded between 11:30-1:30 with lines that can stretch out the door.  I always order online - it is really easy and you get to walk right in and pick it up without waiting in that awful line!,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This Chipotle location is great. Super popular though; which means super busy most of the time but it's well with the wait. Food is always hot and fresh and there is always plenty of staff to help keep the lines moving. I always enjoy coming here and favor it over a couple other locations.   Only downsides?   Parking.  The plaza that this location sits in sometimes runs short on parking; which makes getting in from the front lot to the front door a challenge anytime after 11:30 AM. But no complaints about the quality of food or the staff.   Busy.  Like I mentioned earlier; there are several car dealerships and office parks nearby which means plenty of office folks and dealership employees coming by everyday for lunch. There's also a major shipping center across the freeway and so there is always lots of people stopping in. But overall; it's worth it as there is plenty of staff to handle the line. I've never waited longer than 6-7 minutes to order my food.   Give it a try of you're in the area. Totally worth it!   Great location all around!,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,"They were not paying attention when I was ordering; maybe the heat was getting to them? I kept repeating myself and they still ended up not charging me for my drink and were baffled when I asked for my cup. It was good; but as a native Californian I was a little alarmed when I saw the \no firearms allowed in the store\"" sign outside after already sitting down. Really; Arizona? That's nothing on Chipotle; though. If anything; kudos to them for that. Four for the clean area; good quality and good air conditioning. Otherwise; those workers need coffee or something!""",0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,"We've eaten at Chipotle several times before; but never at this location. And never again at this location. The entree items we got were just fine. The chips were cold; but that is far from the problem.   The issue was the 20-something man who appeared to be the shift manager. First; he was wearing Man-dex. Yes; that's what I said. Spandex. And they were cropped to boot. Somehow; I don't think they were a uniform option. Then; as he weirdly danced around the dining area; doing what; I don't know (certainly not wiping off the filthy tables); a vision came to me of Jame Gumb. I'll give you all a minute to shudder. Then there was also the patronizing and borderline racist interactions with his largely Hispanic staff. He loudly announced to us that he had just learned the Spanish word for \turkey.\"" Then he turned to the man making our food; said the word; and then made a turkey sound. Yes; he gobble-gobbled at the poor man. He did this again and again. It was clear that the staff was embarrassed.   My husband and I were flabbergasted. It was hard not to stare at him in awe of his assholery. Was he high? Could be. Was he a loser who had no business being in charge of a store? Most definitely.   Chipotle; call us when you've replaced this jerk.""",0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Macey is an awesome with her customer service.... The burritos and bowls on point oh and love the beans both kind great salsa friendly staff .,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Thankfully I don't get the urge too often to eat here; but when I do I usually end up putting a good dent into one of their 1;000 calorie burritos.   With so many burrito places in Phx; Chipotle is a once and awhile spot. The chicken is always well seasoned and juicy and the rice and tortilla have that oh too much butter taste.   Overall I would say that this Chipotle is perfect for the business crowd it caters too. Nice burrito at a fair price and good service.,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I had such an experience that I felt the need to share. I made an online order and went to pick it up; it wasn't ready yet; however; the employees were extremely nice and apologetic; I wasn't upset in the least because they had complete positive attitudes; especially Saul; and showed true customer service. And plus; the food was bomb.,1

EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I can always rely on this Chipotle location for consistent service.  Friendly staff and the long line moves fast.,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Good customer service; fast efficient service.,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Maybe it's because I'm accustomed to service in another city.... But I can honestly say these people took twice as long as the longest it's EVER taken to get my order ready at a Chipotle. They even jumped two people in line in front of me. Wowsa.  Edit: This also marks the first time I've ever gotten BURNT food from a Chipotle. I just bit into a bit that was rock solid. Not cool guys; not cool.,1

EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This place is a great location. Right on Camelback and 16th Street.  When you are running errands you can stop in here for a really delish meal.  Every thing i have ever ordered here has been very good. Prices are good; the place is really clean. You have to watch the spice it can be a little hot for me though. I love it; and highy recomend it to you.,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,"Extremely disappointed in this location.  The manager Tiffany Rodriguez treats her employees horrid.  She runs the entire staff through FEAR. I thought Chipotle was a forwarding thinking company by having free ranged meats ect.  But; what I have found out is the manager is incompetent; mean; intolerant and plays with the employees lives using Fear and Manipulation. Tiffany should be fired from this company and my next step is to write a letter to corporate office and include all documentation of the events that have accrued to many of the employees working at this location.  I used to love Chipotle and used to love the taste of the food.  NOW - Chipotle has left a BAD taste in my mouth.  \Food with Integrity\"" is their mission.  Integrity is honoring the \""Whole\"" meaning the animals who give theirs lives to feed us and more importantly the employees who serve this food.  Tiffany Rodriguez is a very; very; very bad example of integrity. As a business owner myself I would clean house at this location and the first one to be removed would be the fear based; manipulative abusive manager named Tiffany Rodriguez.   Word of Mouth is your best advertisement and I will no longer support this company until I know this manager is retrained or fired.  More importantly; if this is how all Chipotle managers operate then Chipotle is a fraud =  Food and service is a fraud.   Beware consumers...these employees at 16th and Camelback in Phoenix are working out of fear of loosing their jobs.  Sad; Sad; Sad - Chipotle should be ashamed.  Tiffany; my suggestion to you is go get some help; my dear. Karma is a bitch.""",0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This place is great!  Menu prices are reasonable.  The service is ridiculously fast; and the staff is friendly.  Watch out for the calories in those burritos!  Everything else is fresh and healthy!  For a chain; this is as good as it gets!,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I'm generally a fan of Chipotle and recently having started HCG and eating clean; even more so. Just a quick tip - If anyone is looking for a decent place to eat out on HCG and not get off track; Chipotle is your answer!   During the very low calorie protocol even - you can order a side of chicken or steak and a side of pico.  It's typically only $3 too.   Yeah Chipotle!,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I am here all the time...so much that I know that they know me well. (If that is a good thing since I make them pick out the onions...only green peppers)  I order the same thing everytime (Chicken burrito bowl)  and it always tastes the same....super yummy!  For the most part; customer service is great; even the newbies that work there are great (even though they can't fold a tortilla)....but I always seem to ask them to put more rice in my bowl....but they have no problem giving me a crapload of beans.,1

EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This place is just average;   It is a fast fix for me.  Service is usually always excellent and food is always the same.   One thing that I do absolutely love is the fast that they introduced tofu into their menu. I have tried it and it is super good.   It is also really convenient for me as it is close by my house. So it is super good in and out when you want quick fix.  Thanks chipottle again for bringing tofu in!,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I have been a long time fan of Chipotle and always have a great experience when I visit. Its a go to place when I'm watching carbs and when I'm not; I LOVE their chips! I could eat a whole bag by myself and that's probably what's caused me to diet in the first place :) You can lesson the calorie blow by ordering the kids sized bag of chips. It seems to come with 15-20 chips which is a more waistline friendly portion if you have to have them.   If you want something that satisfying and doesn't kill your diet; try a bowl with no rice or beans but get a scoop of chicken AND Steak. The extra meat really adds to the heartiness of the bowl and it feels like a treat. I also get mild salsa (pico); sour cream; cheese and the guacamole depending on how I'm feeling that day. If its a diet splurge day; I'm adding the sweet corn and tacking on a bag of chips!,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Ok; I admit; I'm not the hugest fan of Chipotle.  But; from time to time; my co-workers drag me here on lunch; so instead of starve; I eat.  I usually get the same thing while here.  Shredded beef burrito; with rice; beans; and some other stuff on it.  With a drink; it usually sets me back $9.00.  Not bad; really.    As with all the other Chipotle's; this place is always packed with a huge line.  I will say; the service here is always friendly; quick and efficient; so I will get them that.  Drinks are self serve; if you can elbow through the mass of people to get to it; and seating can be limited if you go during the rush hour like we did.  Parking can be tough since its in a strip mall next to a total wine; so be prepared to park and walk some.  I will probably go here again at the demands of my coworkers.  LOL,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,"I got to the Chipotle on 16th St and Camelback twice a week and today I had very bad service. There was a customer in front of me that wanted every piece of meat that had black on it picked out of his food; after several minutes of my food getting cold I asked the young lady if she could just put meat on mine and pass him she then asked the girl at the register she said \he can wait\""! I then said I would like to speak to a manager his name was Richard. Richard was just a rude and flippant with me as the girl at the register! I will be going to Cafe Rio from now on; foods better anyways! Poor customer service is one thing I hate!""",0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,My first experience at Chipotle was here and I'm glad I chose those place. Since it was my first time there; they were pretty patient with me on me deciding what I wanted; but I ended up getting a chicken burrito that was huge and kept me full and so happy I didn't waste money on a skimpy meal somewhere else that's usually $20 bucks. Great staff; friendly and fast service. I will go back anytime I'm at Scottsdale Fashion Square :),1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I don't know if I was extremely hungry or what but my burrito was bomb dot com. I went during lunch and of course the line was long but it moved quickly.  The customer service was great.  The chicken was fresh and hot; the portions were perfect because some other Chipotle's put more rice than meat which makes it less appetizing. Good job,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I love chipotle! I officially give up on online ordering from this location due to past experiences of it never being ready; but its not like I'm gonna stop eating here its like my favorite yummmm! Sucks I have to do pick up orders for different locations when I wanna stop in a rush and run in and out on my way to work to have a delicious burrito for my lunch; but can't afford to be held up! Dinner on my way home; I can handle waiting on from here though! ;),0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Does anyone ever ever get a hankering for Chipotle? ... like every other day? Just me? I'm okay with that.  First time trying this Chipotle location for an early dinner; decided to go with a bowl with chicken and of course guac. Everything was filled and my bowl was decently filled with food. It's just a shame that guac costs an arm and a leg for a little cup of the stuff. Did I still get it? --Obviously!  Chicken was flavorful; good portions as I had enough for left overs for the next day. The price for a chicken bowl with guac came out to be around ~$8.  Service was pretty fast when I ordered; but upon eating the line quickly went out the door. So I'm guessing this location gets pretty crowded during dinner time.  Will be back- undoubtedly. Will I get guac again? ... obviously. But just so you know Chipotle; the cost of your guac is ridiculous it was close to $2 for that tiny thing!,0

EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Came here to grab lunch.  OMG; the line was wrapped clear around the place into the dinning area.  Kinda of crazy; but the line moves fast.  I ordered my usual; chicken burrito but togo.    The chicken was a little more spicier than normal; but it was good.    Cons:  parking sucks and getting out of the plaza sucks.,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Food is great and you can modify to fit most diets. HOWEVER; the MOD that was there today at lunch is worthless!  Chipotle; get rid of this waste of space and lower your prices on guacamole!    Probably won't visit this location again because of this parasite.   Oh and don't order online; ever; they mess up your order and it takes way longer then waiting in line.,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,"there are some restaurants i frequent where i will order different things on the menu every time i go; chipotle is not one of those places. i get the same order every. single. time. i know what it should taste like because i have eaten the same thing at many different locations for several years. that's the beauty of chain restaurants; right? consistency and familiarity in a potentially unfamiliar place? i've been coming to this location off and on for the last year or so and it has been consistency disappointing.  often times i will get a burrito bowl to go and take it home to eat it since i am LITERALLY 4 streets away. this might be a weird thing to look forward to; but when I get a to go order; i like that when i get to the place i am eating at; the steam from the hot food has melted the cheese inside the container. however; at this chipotle; i have to actually put my food in the microwave to heat it up because it was never that warm to begin with. how is it even possible for my food to be so luke warm when i am only traveling a few minutes away?   in addition; almost every time i've gone to this particular location; there has been a to go order being made when i arrived. of course this is not chipotle's fault; but every time that's happened; i have been completely ignored to make the order. no greeting; no \we'll be with you in a minute\""; just employees pretending i don't exist until their 15 burrito to go order has been completed. why can't you let me order quickly in between? i know exactly what i want; it will take 30 seconds. my favorite is when no one has even arrived to pick it up by the time i have waited; gone through the line; paid and left. why are you rushing to make food for customers who aren't even RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU ALREADY? i am also then fully aware that i am getting the bottom of the pan food because the fresher stuff has been used for customers who aren't even there yet.  chipotle; i have loved you for many years now; but i just can't go to this location anymore.""",0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I LOVE the food!! I would like it if I didn't feel rushed every time I place an order. But all the staff is great. They weren't going to charge my husband for double meat till we mentioned it. The cashier thanked us for being honest and the manager gave us a buy one get one free coupon!,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Mmmmmm gluten free goodness. I'm completely obsess with Chipotle. If I could eat it ever day I would. Which is sad; I know; but stop judging me! You're on here to read a review about it - look in the mirror!  Anyways...I think that this Chipotle has the friendliest service. The management has been so nice to me; and the worker bees are really great. In fact; when I see some of the line cooks/chefs at other Chipotle restaurants; I smile! This is just a great location.,1
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Maybe it is ridiculous; but to me Chipotle is another example of people completely missing the point.  You can not consistently get a better meal for under $7.  In my life I have probably eaten at Chipotle a little over 100 times at locations across four states.  Consistently; the ingredients are fresh; the service is friendly and the price is almost unfathomably fair.  If you think Chipotle is only burritos; you are missing the point.  If they are not busy; order soft tacos.  You get three; ask for three different meats.  Mix it up; all four are delicious; while I do tend to favor their free-range carnitas and the chicken.  Move on to salsas; get at least two; I prefer the fresh tomato (aka pico de gallo) and the medium corn (aka elote). You have hereby made your meal healthy and vegetable heavy.  Especially when you finish with freshly shredded romaine lettuce.  Also justify the cheese and super fresh mexican sour cream as fulfillment of calcium rations.  If you really need to cut carbs or some lame-o thing like this; get a salad or a burrito bowl with black beans.  If you want to turn your order into two meals; stick with the burrito and load it up; or get the burrito bowl; vegetarian; load up the salsa; black beans and guacamole and add on a side of chips for .95.  Now start planning your Halloween free burrito costume.,1

EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This was my first time at a Chipotle. Everyone loves it so I finally decided to try it. I got a burrito bowl to go and sat down to eat it five minutes later at home.  It was almost as cold as if it had been in the refrigerator. I had to microwave it; which isn't ideal with guacamole. The steak was also kinda tough.   The food is okay; bordering on good; but I probably won't go back.,0
EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,"Finally went today after living in Phoenix over 5 months now. (Hooray for being here 5 months!) I went for lunch with a friend/co-worker. The line was super long; but they placed a female employee in the line who took orders and swiped your credit card even before you made it to the counter. I'm sure this helps moves things along during their lunch and dinner rushes. The employee in line and the counter gals were not overly friendly. Actually; you could tell they pretty much hate their jobs.   Now on to the food. I had the \naked\"" chicken burrito. I'm sure they call it something else at Chipolte; but I don't remember what. The price was right; but lacked the extras I get at Qdoba. Less toppings- no free chips; less salsa choices; and no extra sauces. And $1.80 extra for guac?! Yikes. Overall I prefer Qdoba in flavor; selection; and overall experience. I should not complain as I did not pay for my lunch. I am ready to try Baja Fresh next....or just head to Qdoba.""",0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,outstanding.  great service; great toppings; amazing concept.  price is right as well.  kudos.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,"Fired is right down the street from my office and continues off the custom personal pizza concept. The pizzas taste pretty good and their gluten-free pizza crust is more doughy and doesn't have the cardboard consistency that some other places do. The service is always friendly and quick; even during the lunch rush. The reason it's 4 stars for me is because my first exposure to the concept was Pieology (-- BIG fan; their mission statement should be \making fatboy pizza dreams reality\"").""",1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Pizza is decent; very filling! Had the pepperoni; pineapple; mozzarella; fresh mozzarella and jalapeño toppings on my pizza. They have ALMOST gluten free crusts. Whatever that means. I would love to try a salad here. I'd probably save a couple bucks on the iced tea variety available since it was really bland and pretty much tastes like plain H2O. Not a bad price for what you get overall. Nice people working this spot. It reminds me of a Subway line in regard to the way you order and customize your food. Welcome to the neighborhood!,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Great new spot for made to order pizzas that come out in just 2 min fully cooked. Fresh ingredients and welcoming staff that is always helpful. Great idea; try it out you won't be disappointed.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Great pizza and good service.  It is a great concept in which you construct your own pizza from a great selection of toppings and almost before you can sit down; your pizza is ready.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Amazingly amazing inexpensive pizza. The crust is very thin and crispy which I love.  Came with my wife and since friends.  We all had custom pizzas which were cooked in about 5 minutes. Some of us had salad which was also custom and made to order. Everything was fantastic. Can't wait to come back. Oh and the Orchid is also amazing.  8 bucks max. Cheese pie I 6!,0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Love the idea of this place; fresh; fast; build-your-own pizza! They have a great variety and good options for different dietary needs.  I got a gluten-free crust with marinara sauce and nearly every vegetable offered..no cheese. It was very good; but I did feel a little sick after eating it; not sure why. I did really enjoy it though. My sister ordered a pookie and liked it as well. It was the perfect single serving haha.   This place is also very reasonably priced which is a big plus. You can get whatever you want and they do not really charge extra.   Will definitely be coming back :),0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Decent enough pizza that gets good lunch play because of an attractive price point and quick service.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Awesome fresh from the oven thin crust pizza pies as you request & bangin' Bellinis? Yes please!! Super friendly & efficient service? Thank you!! Was quiet when mom & I were there.  The steak & blue was fantastic & awesome with the garlic powder! Great idea :-) will be back for the BBQ Hawaiian for sure! Put some bacon on it for me!!,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Awesome made to order custom pizzas and salads (don't forget to ask for extra toppings if you want!). I don't know why more people don't know about this place.,0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,We loved the fast & tasty pizzas and the service was STELLAR! They genuinely cared & checked in with us (even though they didn't have to). Impressed! Will be back for sure!!,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,"I will say I absolutely love this place. I come here at least twice a week in which I always get a pizza and a pookie to go. Every time time has been a pleasant experience except for tonight.  I came in 15 mins before they close and one of the cooks decided to mumble \fucking customers need to go away because were closing\"". I literally walked in when I heard him say this. This is very unprofessional. I work in the service industry and even though I sometimes get frustrated; I have never spoke like that on the floor especially in front of customers.   Word of this wise; if customers didn't come in you would be out of a job bud.""",0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,No complaints. The service was perfect. Two college kids with great attitudes and friendly service. They walked us through how it worked and even cleaned off our area while we sat and talked.  The decor was modern and very hip. Not a huge fan of the graffiti but it gives it individual sense of style. The pizza place really stands out I comparison to any resteraunt I've been to due to it's system and decorum.  Lots of toppings and because they have such a hot fiery oven it can heat up numerous toppings .  Items looked fresh and up to code no wilted veggies and the spinach is put into olive oil?   Also had a steak and blue salad. Just right amount of balsamic and cheese. Great portions for 20 dollars I was so full and ready for a nap.   First place I've been to in Scottsdale that really impressed me.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Been there several times and have really enjoyed their made to order salads and pizza. My husband loves it too. I love that the pizza comes out piping hot. Service is fast and very friendly and they have made some really good suggestions. Great thin crust pizzas.,1

iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,I am all about being able to customize my order without upsetting a waiter and this custom pizza ordering style place has become an instant favorite.  The first time I went here I topped my pie with almost every veggie they had and it turned out amazing. Which is sometimes hard to do when you put a lot of veggies on a pizza. They don't skimp you with topping either; this personal sized pizza will fill you up. The thin crust style is perfect in regards to taste and crunchiness.   The second time I came here I decided to try out a salad. Again; I could completely customize it with their buffet style ordering line; and no surprise it was delicious as well; and the size made it very filling.  I think the best thing to do here is go with someone else; one person order a pizza; one a salad and you split it. Best of both worlds in my opinion!!,0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,I've grabbed pies from this Fired Pie on four occasions so far; my latest trip was last night.  Tons of topping selections including sauce/cheese/meats/veggies/fresh herbs and you just go through the assembly line and pick as many of each as  you want for $7.95.  The crust is thin with a cornmeal dusting on the bottom and the ingredients are fresh.  Every time I've ordered red sauce gorgonzola; fresh mozzarella; parmesan; garlic and fresh oregano and each one has been great.  They're not cheap with the toppings either which I almost expected given the price.  I haven't tried their salads yet but I'm sure they're just as good.  Fired Pie gives the better pizza places in the area a serious run for their money from a taste perspective which is surprising considering you can generally get out of there in about 10 minutes with a fresh and delicious pizza.,0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Pizza goes fast food; as you have to stand in line to order.  And just when you find a spot to sit; they call your name.  Despite it being fast food; the pizza is actually pretty good.  It's thin; crispy; and you pick your toppings.  The salads are great too.,0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,We have frequented this location both for dine-in with the kids and take out. We have consistently had good service. It typically isn't very busy; so you will be in and out in no-time. They are generally friendly. Best part is the price - you can get your pizza anyway you like (as many toppings as you like) for $8. Their salads and deserts are also excellent. We will continue to return.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Fired Pie is the Chipotle of the pizza world. I love the concept of this place because I'm picky and I modify my order 99% of the time I dine out. They offer fresh; fast pizza and salads. The BF and I ordered pizzas; of course. You start out with customizing everything from the sauce to the toppings -- a variety of meats; cheeses; veggies; herbs. They also offer alcohol as well as serve yourself fountain drinks (woohoo!) You can even grab your own to-go boxes which is very convenient. Not having someone wait on you is great for those who are lunching and need to get back to work promptly. The staff took our empty pizza trays when we were done.   Mine needed more sauce (I don't eat cheese; so more sauce is needed) and it was a bit burnt; but it was still good pizza. The BF enjoyed it a lot and we will definitely go back. and most of all it's reasonably priced. There are a lot of pizza places that will charge you for the pizza and then per individual topping; which can get pricey. This is all the toppings you could want for $7.75.   I read someone's review on here that says they've never burnt her pizza; so maybe it was a one time thing. Next time I'll ask for more sauce :),0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Had lunch there today and got the two slices and drink special.  The pepperoni slice was so yummy and fresh.  The crust was doughy and just the right temperature.  The staff is always friendly and go out of their way to make sure we have a good time when ordering.    Great place to go when time is short and i am in the mood for a quick slice of pizza.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Great food & fast service. You can't beat the prices either. Small space inside so it gets a little crowded during the lunch rush.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,"If I were to write a movie about my experience at Fired Pie; it would be a complete comedy of errors titled \Is Anyone Here Listening To Me?\""  Fired Pie has been on my radar since it's close to where I live and I could basically live off pizza if I had to (and even if I didn't have to). The glowing Yelp reviews helped make our choice to go in for an early dinner on Friday.  The experience of making your own pizza and choosing your own toppings is awesome...if the people behind the counter are actually listening to you. Here is; verbatim; how it went when it was my turn:  Guy: \""What can I get started for you?\"" Me: \""I'll have the veggie pizza; but with pesto instead of red sauce\"" Guy: \""Sure\"" *immediately picks up red sauce and puts all over my pizza* Me: \""...can I have some pesto on there too?\"" Guy: \""Yeah. What kind of cheese?\"" Me: \""...um. Mozzerella.\"" Guy: *Puts mozz on my pizza; slides it down to toppings area* Me: \""Can I please have some pesto on there too?\"" Guy: \""Oh; sure\"" *drizzles small spiral of pesto over cheese*  So. That's how that started.   The girl who handled my toppings seemed to have no idea what went on their menu-standard veggie. We both kept having to look back at the one menu on the side wall (they should definitely invest in an over-the-back-counter menu ala every other fast/casual food joint for ease) and check to make sure she got it correct. She wasn't sure what went on my boyfriend's pesto chicken pie either.   Speaking of boyfriend; he also handled to ordering for the field greens and roasted veggie salad we wanted. First guy lined up two salad bowls; so it looks like they split them there with no problem. Great! He also asked that they sub the balsamic out for italian dressing; which guy said would be no problem.  Once our pizzas rode the struggle bus out of the toppings area; we were asked for our names to write on the paper that our pizza slid onto in the oven; to keep everyone straight. We told them our order was for there; ordered drinks from the woman at the end of the line and sat down at a booth; after we picked up our own silverware and parm/red pepper shakers. Hopefully we could get over our ordering disaster and eat some delicious pizza!  I heard my name called and looked to the counter to see two pizza boxes and a boxed salad sitting on top (complete with a side of...you guessed it...balsamic dressing.) I couldn't do anything but laugh; it was the perfect ending to this nightmare of an order. First guy behind the counter had even taken out two bowls for our salad TO EAT THERE! Boyfriend was about to have a stress embolism so I scooped up our food and got the hell out of there. \""We would literally have to order the opposite of what we wanted for it to come out right the first time;\"" he said in the car. Basically.  Why the second star? I have to be fair; the food was absolutely delicious. The pizza's crust was really on point and the salad was completely filled with roasted veggie toppings (and even better once I added my own dressing from our fridge.) But it was downright insulting to have NO ONE working there listening to us. I don't understand at all. Was it an off night? Was it an off team working? Did they hate us for some reason? I doubt I can convince the boyfriend to go back; so maybe I'll never know. Dang.""",0
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,One of the owners of Fired Pie reached out to me after reading my initial review. He apologized for our bad experience; said it was not up to their standards and offered to send me a gift card to try them out again. I accepted; and was really happy to see someone higher up caring about customers.  We called in an order last night; exactly the same as before. One veggie pie with pesto instead of red sauce; one pesto chicken pie and a roasted veggie salad with Italian instead of balsamic. My boyfriend had the call on speaker and I heard the girl repeat our order back to him just as we wanted it. Great!  Apparently all did not go as smooth as it sounded when he went to go pick up our food. First; the girl at the register didn't know how to run the gift card. Then; when our order was 10 cents over the gift card's $25 amount; she gave my boyfriend back the wrong change. (He only had a $20 on him and she initially gave him back $19.10 instead of $19.90)   THEN we get home and all looks well...except my pie has red sauce on it. Fired Pie; do you have a personal vendetta against me eating pesto or what?! I started cracking up; and boyfriend vowed that he'll never go there again. It SUCKS; because the food is so great! We received the correct dressing this time for the salad; which was delish! It just goes to show how little service details can really make or break a place for us. Luckily for Fired Pie; it looks like basically everyone else going there has four or five star experiences...I guess we're just outta luck.,0

iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,I have been to Fired Pie twice now and each time it has been delicious. The first time my husband and I came on a Sunday around 8pm. The place was dead - the only people inside were the employees. That was fine by me as we were able to place our to-go order quickly. The second visit was with my husband and my father on a Wednesday at 6:30pm. Again; the place was pretty dead but they actually had a few other customers. (Definitely not packed!)  If you haven't been; the concept is you walk up; tell them if you want a salad or a pizza and then they make it right in front of you. For pizza; they ask what kind of sauce (marinara; pesto; alfredo; garlic/oil); what kind of cheese (mozzarella; feta; blue cheese); and then pick your toppings. They have several different types of meat and vegetables to choose from. My perfect pizza has artichokes; spinach; tomatoes; mushrooms; Kalamata olives; and garlic. We've tried their sausage and chicken - both are good. I prefer the pesto; but I'd like to try to alfredo sauce. Additionally; we've tried the pizza cookie - which is tiny but delicious. Definitely learned our lesson and will order separate desserts next time. ;)  Overall; I really like the concept. It's fast; customizable; and super quick to get your meal. That pizza is literally done in 5 minutes and cooked to perfection! I will definitely be back!,1

I've only been in once and it will not be my last time. I just don't think I'm super excited to come back right away.   It wasn't the food that disappointed me as much as the service.   I ordered a salad and explained that I did not want peppers. It went something along the lines of this...

iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,"After a second visit; I am happy to bump up my rating to 5 stars!!   Noon probably wasn't the best time to come; but they get you through that line very quickly. Everyone was professional; friendly and on their \A-Game\""! My buddy ordered a pizza to go and they offered to put it in the food warmer to keep it nice and toasty while we enjoyed our lunch.   I ordered the tomato basil pizza with mushrooms and it was fantastic. When it was handed to the guy running the oven; he asked the guy to toss on a few more mushrooms. I liked that he took the time to look over the pizza to make sure it was up to his standards.   This location is now in our regular lunch rotation (on days I'm not convinced I should be on a diet).""",1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Great variety of pizzas which you can specify ingredients. Very friendly staff and speedy service. Only down point is loud music,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Great pizza your way. Only down fall music is way to loud. Super service and friendly staff.,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Amazing pizza and salad.  Great service; fast and delicious!!! First time coming and won't be the last.   We customized all 3 pizzas.   Great flavor; crust was done just right and crispy.  A new family fav!,1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,"There's a lot to like about this place. It's a fast casual dining experience for delicious pizza. I like the pizzas; the space inside; the service is always nice; and the location is good (at least for us because it's not far).   However; I don't give it 5 stars. Here's why... when they have a line; it's not so \fast\"" casual and can take a bit to get through and get your food. To prevent this experience I simply make sure to visit before or after any rushes.   My only other gripe is that it doesn't seem like they use any local; organic; or higher quality ingredients. They have an opportunity to set themselves apart by offering cheeses that are from a source where there's no added hormones and pasture raised. If they had organic tomato sauce (and some of the veggies) that would be great; too.   Oh; and I must say... they have a good gluten free crust. It's the reason we go there at all is for the gluten free but I'd go even more if they bump up the quality of their ingredients.""",1
iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Super fresh and delicious; with friendly service too!  I will be telling all of our local friends and neighbors to come here instead of Rays and NYPD that are just around the corner.  What a great deal if you like getting lots of toppings since you can add whatever you want. We will be back very soon!    Fired Pie; welcome to the area!,1
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Now I love Chipotle....I've been to many indifferent states and I've always gotten consistently good food I can always rely on.  So when I thought I try a new location on the way home  I could not believe how disappointed I was about to be.  After watching the people in line order; I noticed the guy was putting 2 spoonfuls of rice on everyones burrito...now I know it's a filler but come on!!  So I asked him to go easy on the rice; which to him meant 1 heaping big spoonful followed by the tinyest portions of beans and meat.  You have to be kidding me.  So I asked for some more beans to which I got an incredible glare and probably what led to the even smaller amounts of meat.    Ok; if I hadn't sat down to eat there I may never have noticed what was to follow.  Every single man had HUGE portions in their burrito bowl as they took their meal to the table and every woman has small portions...interesting.  Just because I may not eat as much as some men; doesn't mean I don't like leftovers.    Sorry I guess this franchise has plenty of money coming in...they definitely don't need any of mine.,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,well; i have a special place in my heart (and stomach) for burritos; and this place is like heaven for me.  these GIANT burros comes wrapped in a huge; steamy tortilla; with your choice of black or pinto beans; grilled veggies; rice; chicken (or go all veg) and fixin's like sour cream and pico. it's a long counter ordering/instruction process...like subway.  they conveniently wrap it all in foil so you can eat it with your hands (it takes two).,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Excellent customer service. Very friendly staff and they even gave us free drinks and some chips.,1
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Chipotle is one of my favorite mexican restaurants.  They offer huge burritos as well as you can skip the tortilla and get a bowl.  They also will make cheese crisps for children.  Prices are $5.50-$6.00.  You can have anything made into a salad for an additional $0.50.  They can get crowded on the weekends; but you can also fax or do your order online and just pick it up.  This Chandler Mall location is nice because it allows my wife I to eat in the food court so the kids can get their favorite meal.  FYI though; this is not in the food court.  It is outside by the fountains.  It is a good value because the burrito's are huge.,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,This is my favorite place to eat whwn craving mexican style food.  Love the corn and Hot salsa.  Quacamole is also very very good.  Not super hungry?  Order a single taco.,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Chipotle is amazing; and this one is no different from all of the others. Fast service; great food; reasonable price.  Get the bowl not the burrito for more food. I think they charge 99 cents for a tortilla with the bowl so it is no longer free. I was originally mad about this but it makes sense for them. Also make sure to get salad dressing on the bowl; it makes it infinitely better.,1
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,"I've never had a \bad\"" experience at chipotle cause seriously; how could you go wrong at chipotle? Ever?! Maybe it's just my unlucky day. The dude who was making my order just seemed like he dreaded working there. Now I understand that when you're having a bad day; it might be hard to smile and act friendly; but don't take it out on my food!!! I'm paying $8 for this piece of **** so make it right. He was being so stingy on EVERYTHING he added to my bowl; from the rice to the veggies to the corn; I had to repeatedly ask him \""could you put more?\"" ...which I've NEVER had to do at a chipotle. Awkward as it already is; when we got to the end he asked me \""anything else?\"" And I'm like; no I think I'm good; thanks. And then he's like \""are you SURE??\"" What on earth! Now I'm getting attitude?!?!!! At a damn chipotle? Jeez!""",0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Good food made to order.  Even though it's chain food it's good.,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,awesome customer service every time and great food.. love eating here!,1
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Staff here is super friendly.  I usually don't review chain restaurants but this location is going above and beyond with customer service.,1
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Always good. Always.   My favorite order is: Rice Bowl to go Brown Rice No beans; extra rice No Meat 2 scoops of picco Corn Sour Cream Lettuce  Large cheese quesadilla on the side! I know; no meat. But it's good!,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,My kids like the tacos here.  I'll usually park and have them go in by themselves and order. They never had any problems.  I really like the corn salsa. I call it that because that's what it tastes like. It's super tasty.  It really should he their signature item; like Chevy's mushed corn side.,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,YUM!  I always order a vegetarian burrito with black beans.  I ask for an extra tortilla (free) so I can take half the stuffing out of the burrito and save it for a meal later.,0
x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Be careful during the lunch rush; this store will have a line out the door! (For good reason though). All Chipotles use quality ingredients; and have a superior product. In my opinion; this store stands out because of the staff. Very friendly and extremely efficient. I use the iPhone app (ya; there's an app for that) and order/pay from my office. When you get there you can stroll right up to the counter and simply pick up your bag to-go. Nothing to sign; no hassle; and no wait. Can't beat it!! Don't stress accuracy of your order either. I've had zero issues with that.,1
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,"I was so excited to see a Culver's open up right by where I live. I haven't had it since I moved out here from the Midwest. Their chicken tenders are the best and I always get them. You really can't get them anywhere else. They're super juicy but crispy at the same time.   However; I'm going to be unbiased and write my review for this location only.  The food; as I mentioned before; was great and just like what I remembered. The service and atmosphere; that's another story. I understand that they just opened very recently so they probably still have some training/kinks to work on. I'll definitely be back and will update my rating if they deserve it.   Strike one; the first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench. It smelled like a mixture of rotten eggs and a gas station restroom. I noticed it was really bad where you order your food and wasn't so bad in the seating area. They really need to work on their ventilation or something. It's really hard to enjoy your food when you have to smell that.   Strike two; when I received my food; I noticed that I was given regular fries instead of sweet potato fries. I told the person who brought them to me that I had ordered the sweet potato fries. She walked off with my food and her attitude. She came back a little later and asked if I was sure if I ordered the sweet potato fries because on the ticket; it didn't say that I ordered them and apparently it's a dollar extra for sweet potato fries. Umm; yes I'm sure I know what I ordered. And really? A dollar for sweet potato fries? Most restaurants just sub the two. Either way; it was clearly their mistake and she could have been more accommodating or just gave me the sweet potato fries and lost a dollar. I was with a bunch of my coworkers who had never gone before and I was really excited for them to try it out. The service we got did not leave the best taste in their mouths. They also got a few other orders wrong but we didn't say anything because we already saw how unhelpful they were with me.   Strike three; some of us went back up to the counter to order dessert and cheese curds because no one had them before and wanted to try them out. The man who brought us the desert took our number holder and we pointed out to him that we had more food coming too and he said; \I just do the desserts.\"" That's kind of a weird system and seems very inefficient. Why wouldn't you just bring one cement mixer and one cheese curd out at the same time? He finally understood that we still needed the number on our table for our other food and left.

uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,Awful! This is basically DQ on steroids. I asked the counter server about a few items which he had no idea about anything. Wife ordered chicken strip dinner $9 and it was essentially frozen Tyson chicken out of a bag; gross!!!! Fries were cold and soggy. I just got chili $4 for a little container and it was basically Wendy's. For $13 fast foot for 2 little items and crap food; it's a joke. Oddly; we looked around the place and noticed most diners were a bit obese; think it must be a place for mid westerners.  Won't ever be back; would rather go to habit burger or in-n-out or even McDonald's for that matter. This place is a joke.,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,Saw this ad on TV about their chicken tenders. So I decided to give it a try. When you enter this place; it is huge. The cashiers are on your left as you enter and if you're trying to look for chicken meals; it is over in the far left of the signs. About 1/12 of the space is dedicated to the   chicken. I thought this would be a restaurant and not a fast food place.  I ordered the fried chicken dinner; which can be 2 or 4 pieces; didn't see a 3 piece dinner. I ended up getting the 4 piece which is basically half the chicken. It was breast; thigh; drumstick and wings with mash potatoes; biscuit and  coleslaw.   The chicken was tasty; mashed potatoes was a bit dry and the coleslaw was OK. Since I had dinner by myself; I'll have to take my wife here for lunch so we can try the butter burgers.,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,First time at a Culver's after I had heard good things from multiple people. Overall; not really too impressed. I should have checked yelp and read all the great reviews about the custard as I probably would  have stuck with that.  First; pretty slow for fast food. You order; pay and then pull up into a parking/waiting spot until your food comes out. Not a big issue and I guess everything is cooked to order.  My main issue was the food. I had a bacon burger with cheese. Side of fries and a soda.  Pretty standard fast food meal. When I got home I pretty much had a greasy bag.  The burger was super greasy; somewhat flavorful; and kinda boring. I guess the extra grease is the added butter? I don't get it. I'm not the healthiest eater but I felt like this should have come with a side of Lipitor.   The fries were good. I would go back for the fries.  Next time I'm just going to get custard.,0

uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,"I just returned from Culver's and lets just say my experience was not a good one. I will say that the place was very very clean and well kept (bravo for that). There were also nice; large TV's that were showing the football game. The two young boys working the cashier were very nice. My mom was taking quite a while to look over the menu and they asked if she had any questions etc. We ordered and went to sit down in the \dining area\"". Once we sat down there were two employees eating. I assumed they were on their lunch break or had just gotten off work and were having a bite to eat. It was a male and a female employee. The male employee was extremely rude and obnoxious. He was sitting in the booth chewing up his food and opening his mouth to show his other co workers who were all the way across the establishment behind the cash registers. Everyone who was sitting in the \""dining area\"" was looking at him in disgust. You are an employee; yes you are probably 15 or 16 but really? I was so grossed out by this! The he continued to do that while laying down across the booth and flailing his arms and legs knocking into the table causing a lot of noise and a scene. I don't know who the manager is; but I don't find that acceptable at all.   Food: All of my midwest friends rave about this place. I honestly have no idea why. I ordered a burger. It looked nothing like what it was supposed to look like and the actual meat part of it was paper thin and crispy looking (ew). My mom ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and they brought out something else but were very nice and responsive and brought out the correct food quickly. She didn't think the food was that great either.   Let's just say I will not be returning; and maybe the management needs to reevaluate allowing employees to take breaks with customers; or else clean house. That is not acceptable anywhere for an employee to behave as this one did.""",0

uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,They screwed up my order; so I was quite annoyed. Went drive through; did not check bag because it felt like a burger was in there. A burger was in there actually; but it wasn't what I ordered. A mix-up in the communications between me and drive through woman. After eating burger; communicated my frustration through satisfaction survey and received a phone call within 15 minutes of clicking send. manager was really nice and apologized and apparently; my name is at this Culver's; waiting for me to cash in on a free basket. Good follow-up skills saved this place.,1
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,They don't have these in Cali so thought I would try it out as just another fast food burger place.

We have daughter that is allergic to soy; gluten and dairy and both black beans and pinto beans so you can imagine the difficulty with getting her the proper nutrition and the right amount of protein.  When we told Bob our needs he said that he could take the fish; and cook it adding only lemon juice and a little olive oil.  That was great but he even went further; he cleaned the part of the grill that he used to remove any gluten or soy residue and had the person that makes salads use new gloves (no residue from gluten or soy).  So the meal was great and the service even better.  Thank you Bob.   As others with allergies know it is difficult to find locations to go to and get good food. So I recommend this Culver's  at Shea and the 101.,1
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,I don't know why anyone would ever come back here? I'm so confused how they stay in business. I ordered a Sourdough Melt that looks really good on the menu with a few layers of meat but it's a burnt sandwich and the cheese is literally thicker than the meat. I took it back and they stood by it saying their meat is pretty thin. She offered to make me another one but if there was nothing wrong with the first one in their eyes why would I want another one? Worst sandwich I've ever had. Will never come back. Not offered something else or a refund...,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,Worst location. Terrible service! I've been to this location twice and they have no clue what they are doing. I ordered a plain cheeseburger and they gave me a hamburger. They gave no condiments at all. Last time I came here I waited 25 minutes in my car before finally going inside and getting a refund. CLEAN It Up Culver's or you'll have seen the last of me. I don't care if your foods good or not.,0

uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,I don't get the hype...wasn't impressed. Our order was right and we got it pretty quickly; so 3 stars it is.,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,I absolutely love that Culver's cares that the animals from the farms where they get their meat are treated humanely and are not given any antibiotics or hormones.  I also love that they are an environmentally friendly and sustainable company with a LEED certified building.  Oh yeah; their food is awesome; too.  It's made to order; which may take a little longer than other fast food restaurants; but it is well worth the wait.  It tastes fresh; and it's delicious.  Hats off to this business!,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,Very disappointed in this place. Not very good food & no imagination ... a melt was extremely yucky!  Service sucked and the boy at the counter was very unenthusiastic & I felt didn't even want to help us.  Never again.,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,This review is strictly for their custard. What a perfect way to fulfill a sweet tooth craving without having to get out of the car! While running some errands; we decided it was time for a sweet treat and since we were in the area; my husband decided to introduce me to the custard at Culver's. We pulled through the drive-through and I took a look at the custard menu. I was told that the Concrete Mixer is the way to go so I had to give it a try! I ordered the mini vanilla Concrete Blizzard with Heath Crunch and Reece's Peanut Butter Cups. Let me just say that the mini is no mini! With the richness of the custard along with the candy; it filled me up quickly! The custard is extremely creamy and delightful and the vanilla was very refreshing for a hot summer night. I am typically more of a chocolate fan and will get a chocolate one next time; but this time; I got to enjoy a couple bites of my husband's chocolate with Reece's and peanut butter. Yum! This is a great option if you're craving something sweet and don't want to get out of your car!,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,I'm not a big fast food person; so this review is only for the ice cream at Culver's. My normal treat of choice is their chocolate malt shake; but I was craving a sundae. I ordered the Turtle; which is caramel and fudge sauce with pecans on Culver's custard. It definitely hit the spot. I like that there is no whip cream but I'm not a big fan of that on my sundaes and I could do without the cherry. Just give me plenty of fudge and caramel sauce.   The location is kind of hard to get into. If you miss the first turn; you'll have to drive down to the light and circle back in the parking lot. I did that the first time I came here; but now I know better. Otherwise; it's conveniently located off the 101 and Shea. Definitely check out their custard ice cream; whether it's a shake or sundae.,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,I love Culvers because it reminds me of home.  The food is usually very good and who can say anything bad about Custard.    My problem is with Culvers all over the Valley and not just this one. Employees; when you are at work; please be at work.  The last three times I have been at Culvers; I know the employees would rather be anywhere else than where they were. They have not listened to me; they constantly ask again and again what I want; they get interrupted by other employees which takes them back to square 1 cause they forget what they were doing.  Tonight I was handed off between two employees for my order.  One of the employees had never run the register before; and he was interrupted several times.  Of course my order was not correct; even after starting over 3 times to get it right.  The kid was trying; he just didnt have the training to be where he was.   Just a poor way to run a register.  I can get a burger anywhere; and probably will from now on.  Custard is making its appearance in Phoenix finally and I will have other places to go for that also.  Culvers Management; your employees need training.  They need to know that when they are working; they need to be with the Customer; treat us with respect; LISTEN TO US; and get our orders right.  Get this message out; your employees; this is not a part time job after school and you do not have to work hard.  Culvers has a good reputation all over the US.  People in Phoenix/Scottsdale can shop anywhere for food like this.  Make the experience pleasant and memorable for the right reasons and people will come back.  When they come back; you will continue to have a job.  I have no reason to come back now until it gets hot and custard is on my mind.   Give me a reason to come back for other things....,0
uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,I dabbled between three and four stars on this one; but had to go with three.   My boyfriend and I decided to go here for ice cream on one of the gruesome 115 degree Arizona afternoons that we Scottsdale natives know to be so draining. After seeing countless Culver's commercials about their signature concrete mixers; ice cream sundaes and several other frozen treats; we decided to go here instead of venturing down Shea to the local Dairy Queen.   Now. I was a little taken back; because I never knew Culver's was a walk-up-and-order fast food kind of joint. Silly me; I thought it was an actual place where you sit down to get burgers and ice cream. But hey. I was wrong. Nothing wrong with that. So we ventured in; ordered; and then found a seat in the dining area (that looks somewhat similar to the inside of the local Wildflower Bread Co.-- decorated with hand-blown glass flowers fake plants and whatnot).   The one thing that kind of rubbed me the wrong way about this restaurant was that the dining area was completely silent. There were about five other seated parties and with no ambient music or noise from the muted television screens that hang above; it makes the atmosphere a little weird. Everyone; including us; felt obligated to have whispering conversations so that it didn't disturb the silence. It was so quiet that I could almost hear the couple in the booth behind us licking the ice cream off their spoons.   Anyhow; we ordered two concrete mixers. Mine: vanilla custard with brownie chunks and snickers and his: chocolate custard with hot fudge and some other chocolate add in. (Each mixer comes with two mix-ins; each additional one after that is .50c) They were both REALLY good. Not the best I've ever eaten; but they definitely beat a Blizzard that you would get from DQ. The custard was smooth in texture; and had a really nice and pure flavor. The employees add a bunch of your mix-ins and are far from skimpy. For the custard to mix-in ratio I'd say about 1/4 of your dessert is mix-ins (which is a great ratio in my opinion). For the two 'short' mixers and a medium drink it was around $10; which really wasn't bad.   The employees were helpful and seemed knowledgeable on their products. Would have been a four star if the ambiance was a little better and a lot less awkward. Quality custard; though!,1
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,First; let me say that I grew up outside of Philly and I appreciate a quality Sub or Cheese-steak. Jersey Mike's has the best cheese-steaks that I've found outside of PA or CA. Everything is top notch except the roll; that's just a little to soft compared to an Amaroso's Roll from Philly. I also miss sauce for a pizza-cheesesteak.   As to the sub sandwiches; again the roll is too soft and the selection of deli meats is slim. Hoagie's from Lee's or Slacks in Philly are available with a much larger variety of Itialian Meats.  Even with these limitations; the sandwiches are still good and appropriately priced; Jersy Mikes is not Subway or Quiznos; these sandwiches are of a  far better quality with fresh sliced meats and cheeses; and fresh tasty veggies.  The online service works great too!  I often order sandwiches for dinner before I leave work and pick them up as I drive by.        Stop in and try the cheese-steak; or a '13'; Original Italian for lunch and you'll be a Mike's fan too!,0

azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,I'm a fan of the chain but I am really tired of this location getting my order wrong. I ask for mayo. NO mayo. I ask for sweet peppers; I get hot. I ask for it to not be Mike's way and it turns out Mike's way. Going somewhere else.,0
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"Okay where to begin? Urban Spoon App pick. Clean; plenty of places to sit; indoors and outdoors. Already its blowing any Sub/Grinder shop Ive been to out of the water. All the sandwiches I saw being made looked ridiculously good! I had the Big Kahuna which is their Philly Cheesesteak with mushrooms and jalapenos added. Now I dont understand the people complaining about not getting your money's worth? Are you kidding me?? This isnt Taco Bell?? Its a friggin sub shop. $14 for 2  well endowed subs is expensive? If this is too rich for your blood. try the dollar menu at Jack in The Box. Or are you one of those that prefer the entire animal in your sandwich (ex. Miracle Mile/Jason's Deli) Ridiculous! Their \regular\"" size is approx an 8 inch sub and they're far from stingy. One average sized person will be more than satisfied with a \""regular\"" sandwich???. Seriously to have to order a Large or have chips on top of your regular is just unnecessary spending and overkill on the food front. It's like people are brainwashed into thinking you have to have a side with everything you eat.. Im not cheap Im just not overeating...If you can eat a regular + add ons....you're either planning for leftovers; an athlete; a grown man; trying to gain weight;  or are friggin stoned !  As for other comments about it being soggy. Yes it was a bit but not falling apart or seemingly dipped in au jus soggy. My \""grinder\"" was fan freakin tastic! It reminded me of D'Angelos #7 for all you East Coasters that may be familiar with that chain. LOVED it!""",0
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,I love Jersey Mikes! Great quality meat and fresh toppings made the way you like it. I crave their sandwiches and eat here all the time. The bread is moist and perfect ratios on the sandwich; so perfectly filling. The staff is awesome and I look forward to my next visit. I may go there tomorrow in fact! Also; I ordered a tray on super short notice for a wedding getting ready meal. The staff made it happen and everyone at the party kept asking where they were from- it was that good!,1
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,I go to the shop off the 51 and Bell Road in Scottsdale. Very efficient service. Happy employees. Great manager(young lady with blonde hair) always singing and smiling. Always gets my order correct. Pricy sandwich; yes; but quality ingredients. I'll always return to same store on my way to and from Tucson.,1

azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,Honestly this beats subway; Jimmy Johns; and Fire House. They have a great amount of selection you can also build your own but it's not as good as subways build your own. But the Philly Cheese Steak sells me it all. The taste is just amazing always hot even when you're 5 bites in. With a side of chips and a drink nothing can be better. Fast service and great workers.,1
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,Ordered a number 56 and got something that was not a number 56 and that was raw.  I would not recommend going to this place ever.,0
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,A couple co-workers and I order lunch from here every Friday on FUN SUB FRIDAY!  The sandwiches are always very yummy; except I notice that the hot subs get soggy after only short time.  And; I am not a huge fan of the wraps.  They put WAY too much dressing on them and they fall apart very easily.  The Italian sub is one of my FAVORITES!  As well as the PHILLY... just as long as you get the bread toasted... that way it doesn't get soggy and make it hard to eat.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good fast sub lunch.,0
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"Not sure what the hype is all about.   I got the cheesesteak with chipotle sauce; she got the Italian \sub in a tub.\""  Her sub in a tub was literally all the ingredients of a sub; in a plastic container; no bread. Does that bother me? No. So why am I making a big deal about it? Because its nothing special. We had it prepared \""Mike's way;\"" which meant it was sprinkled with petrified; flavorless oregano flakes; and dressed with oil and red wine vinegar. Mehh.   The real train wreck was the cheesesteak with chipotle sauce that I ordered. The chipotle sauce was basically some form of heavy; gooey dressing; which sat in my stomach like a rock. For four hours. I felt nauseous the whole time. I have no idea how a cheesesteak with provolone cheese could have possibly turned out like this.   And yes; I spent many years in NJ; so I know a thing or two about good subs.   Not a fan. Sorry.""",0
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,Another decent sandwich shop in an area loaded with decent sandwich shops.   I've tried the veggie sub; it's not bad but they are extremely cheap with the cheese (2 or 3 slices on the two veggie subs I've had from there) but I like that they have whole wheat sub rolls and they have a tasty cherry pepper relish.  I tried a few bites of the Philly which I thought was delicious.  Husband loved their super sub.  I would make a point to stop here for the cheese steak but would go elsewhere for my cheese sub.  They charged us for two extra bags of chips the last time I was there which was annoying but not the end of the world; I'll make sure to check my receipt next time.    Their website needs improvement too; I didn't see all of the sandwich extras available until I tried to order online.  They want a credit card number to order online too - obnoxious.,0
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"Great East Coast Italian subs! Order your sub; \Mikes Way\""....it's great! Friendly owners and staff; go out of their way to be friendly and personable. In fact; my young son is such a fan they recognize him when he comes in. His dream is to work at Jersey Mikes when he turns 16 so he can eat Jersey Mikes every day! Yummy!""",1
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"I wanted to hate Jersey Mike's.  It  looks like a sterile corporate soul sucking building complete with vast parking lot.    We went inside and I appreciate that their menu is short and posted in big enough font to be read from 15 feet away.  What was immediately annoying though was we had no idea where we were supposed to go to order.  I don't like feeling dumb.  Makes my food less tasty.    I ordered a cold turkey sub and my husband got a hot hawaiian philly.  All the employees were friendly but perhaps because of the glass I couldn't understand a word they said.  I ended up getting my sub \Mikes Way\"" because all I could do is smile and nod whenever any of tem spoke to me.  I was HORRIFIED when she started shaking what looked to be gallons of red wine vinegar and oil onto my sub.  She was shaking that thing like I wanted my sub to actually be a red wine soup or something.  SICK!!  So I was understandably nervous that my sandwich was going to be soggy and vinegary and gross.    But...it wasn't.  It was sooooo good.  The bread didn't go soggy; it didn't taste vinegary.  I wished I had gotten a second sandwich so I could've inhaled that one too.  My husband really enjoyed his too.  Thankfully we had a few free sub cards because those two subs would've set us back close to $20.       Points for:  surprisingly delicious food; friendly employees; clean Points off:  PRICE (omg; only going back if someone else is buying); being unable to understand employees   *I gave it one $ because if you are cheap you can get out for less than $10; if you are really hungry or get a whole meal or big sub; you are definitely paying more than $10""",1
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,I gave this place a second chance and had the same poor experience as I did the first time; leading me to believe there is a pattern.    The service is incredibly slow. There was only a couple of people in front of me and they seemed to be friends of the staff. So the staff decided to chit chat for an exceptionally long time rather than moving them through and helping me with my order. Definitely not happy with that; especially since it happened BOTH times I visited.   Next comes the food and I have to say I was very disappointed. The bread was very dry and stale. Really poor quality that I am surprised they actually served. This also happened BOTH times I visited. I couldn't really get beyond that to comment on any other part of the sandwich.  Needless to say;  I won't be visiting Jersey Mike's again and putting myself through a needlessly long wait to get stale bread. If I could give them negative stars I would.,0

azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"The subs I loved when I was a kid at the Jersey Shore have now gone global!! I've been a fan of Jersey Mike's Subs since it was Mike's Subs In Pt Pleasant; NJ.  OK; the bread isn't from Baldanza's. Phoenix is a long way from Long Branch; NJ. However; it's fresh and stands up to the oil and vinegar. My recommendation: if you like Italian cold cuts; the #2 or the #5. The cheesesteaks are the best you're gonna find outside Geno's in Philadelphia. Unless it's a \hot sub;\"" ask for it \""Mike's Way.\"" You'll be glad you did.  This isn't Subway. There are no $5 footlongs here. However; the sandwiches here are much larger and; unlike Subway; the only turkey cold cuts at Jersey Mike's is the turkey breast. The meats and cheeses are all sliced to order and their quality is first rate. You can taste the difference.   The employees are great. If you go in there more than a couple of times; they recognize you. They're great with kids. There are a couple of televisions (at least one is always tuned to \""Sportscenter\"").

azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,Part of my quest to eat something that's not available in Flagstaff after lacrosse games in Scottsdale. Decent sandwiches; good hard working service. Not much variety; but I am not a very picky eater. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here; kinda $$$ for sandwiches.,1

azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"I came to know this place because my boy suggested we stop by here for lunch the other day. My first impression? It was simple; clean; and humble. I got the club sandwich \Mikes Way\"" and to be honest I was very surprised at the amount of flavor it kicked. So here is a break down of my experience.  Pros: 1. The place was clean and homey. 2. The employees were courteous and polite. 3. The food was actually really good and didn't have the gritty industrialized taste like Subway sandwiches have. Very fresh and everything is prepared in front of you; even the meat is sliced to order.  Cons: 1. They overdid the sauce.   If you are not aware what \""Mikes Way\"" is; it is the option of getting olive oil; vinaigrette; onion; tomato; lettuce; and different herbs and spices in your sandwich. It is delicious; so don't get me wrong when I complain about this. However they over oiled my sandwich causing it to go very soggy; very fast. By the time I finished a half of my sandwich and moved to the other; it was falling apart like no ones business. It became a hassle to eat the other half. This is the only negative thing I could find about this place hence 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Over all the experience was fantastic but make sure if you ask for \""Mikes Way\"" to ask them to go easy on the sauce.""",0
azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"In the fast food sandwich market there are many choices based on taste and your pocketbook. Take Jersey Mike's for instance. They are an east coast brand that has been making it's trek west for a few years now. On a recent visit I ordered their Original Italian w/ extra meat and a small soda which came to $12.29. The sandwich was very tasty and came on a 8\ or so size sub.   I've tried various Jersey Mike's along the west coast and they are all uniformly good; Ray Kroc would be proud.  What makes Mike's unique is the grilling of your meat for you Sub.  They have both a Philly and Hawaiian options; etc.   The quality of the meats and sub bread seem above average as the prices reflect; but still a good sub!    ***Don't forget to ask for the \""stamp card\""; so you can record your visit ***""",0
